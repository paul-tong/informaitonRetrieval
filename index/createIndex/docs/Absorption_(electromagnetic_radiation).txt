Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)
in physics absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter typically the electrons of an atom thus the electromagnetic energy is transformed into internal energy of the absorber for example thermal energy1 the reduction in intensity of a light wave propagating through a medium by absorption of a part of its photons is often called attenuation usually the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity linear absorption although in certain conditions usually in optics the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through and saturable absorption or nonlinear absorption occurs

there are a number of ways to quantify how quickly and effectively radiation is absorbed in a certain medium for example the absorption coefficient and some closely related derived quantities

the attenuation coefficient which is sometimes but not always synonymous with the absorption coefficientcitation needed

molar absorptivity is called molar extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity see also beerlambert law

the mass attenuation coefficient is also called mass extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by density

the absorption cross section and scattering cross-section are closely related to the absorption and attenuation coefficients respectively

extinction in astronomy is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient

other measures of radiation absorption are penetration depth and skin effect propagation constant attenuation constant phase constant and complex wavenumber
complex refractive index and extinction coefficient complex dielectric constant electrical resistivity and conductivity

absorbance also called optical density and optical depth also called optical thickness are two related measures

all these quantities measure at least to some extent how well a medium absorbs radiation however practitioners of different fields and techniques tend to conventionally use different quantities drawn from the list above

the absorbance of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it instead of being reflected or refracted this may be related to other properties of the object through the beerlambert law

precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via absorption spectroscopy where a sample is illuminated from one side and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured a few examples of absorption are ultravioletvisible spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy

understanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications

in radio propagation it is represented in non-line-of-sight propagation

in meteorology and climatology global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases such as in the greenhouse effect and land and ocean surfaces see albedo

in medicine x-rays are absorbed to different extents by different tissues bone in particular which is the basis for x-ray imaging for example see computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere used in satellite link design

in chemistry and materials science because different materials and molecules will absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies which allows for material identification

in optics sunglasses colored filters dyes and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb and in what proportions

in biology photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of chloroplasts so that the light energy can be converted into chemical energy within sugars and other molecules

in physics the d-region of earths ionosphere is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum

in nuclear physics absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels densitometry or thickness measurements2
