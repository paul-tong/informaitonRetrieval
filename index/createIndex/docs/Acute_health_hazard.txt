in epidemiology a risk factor is a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection when evidence is found the term determinant is used as a variable associated with either increased or decreased risk

risk factors or determinants are correlational and not necessarily causal because correlation does not prove causation  for example being young cannot be said to cause measles but young people have a higher rate of measles because they are less likely to have developed immunity during a previous epidemic statistical methods are frequently used to assess the strength of an association and to provide causal evidence for example in the study of the link between smoking and lung cancer statistical  analysis along with the biological sciences can establish that risk factors are causal some prefer the term risk factor to mean causal determinants of increased rates of disease and for unproven links to be called possible risks associations etc

when done thoughtfully and based on research identification of risk factors can be a strategy for medical screening1

mainly taken from risk factors for breast cancer risk factors can be described in terms of for example

the following example of a risk factor is described in terms of the relative risk it confers which is evaluated by comparing the risk of those exposed to the potential risk factor to those not exposed lets say that at a wedding 74 people ate the chicken and 22 of them were ill while of the 35 people who had the fish or vegetarian meal only 2 were ill did the chicken make the people ill

so the chicken eaters risk  2274  0297
and non-chicken eaters risk  235  0057

those who ate the chicken had a risk over five times as high as those who did not that is a relative risk of more than five this suggests that eating chicken was the cause of the illness but this is not proof

the probability of an outcome usually depends on an interplay between multiple associated variables when performing epidemiological studies to evaluate one or more determinants for a specific outcome the other determinants may act as confounding factors and need to be controlled for eg by stratification the potentially confounding determinants varies with what outcome is studied but the following general confounders are common to most epidemiological associations and are the determinants most commonly controlled for in epidemiological studies

other less commonly adjusted for possible confounders include

a risk marker is a variable that is quantitatively associated with a disease or other outcome but direct alteration of the risk marker does not necessarily alter the risk of the outcome for example driving-while-intoxicated dwi history is a risk marker for pilots as epidemiologic studies indicate that pilots with a dwi history are significantly more likely than their counterparts without a dwi history to be involved in aviation crashes6

the term risk factor was first coined by former framingham heart study director dr william b kannel in a 1961 article in annals of internal medicine7
