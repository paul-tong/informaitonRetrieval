243_Ida
ida ˈaɪdə minor planet designation 243 ida is an asteroid in the koronis family of the asteroid belt it was discovered on 29 september 1884 by austrian astronomer johann palisa at vienna observatory and named after a nymph from greek mythology later telescopic observations categorized ida as an s-type asteroid the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt on 28 august 1993 ida was visited by the unmanned galileo spacecraft while en route to jupiter it was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite

idas orbit lies between the planets mars and jupiter like all main-belt asteroids its orbital period is 484 years and its rotation period is 463 hours ida has an average diameter of 314 km 195 mi it is irregularly shaped and elongated apparently composed of two large objects connected together its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the solar system featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages

idas moon dactyl was discovered by mission member ann harch in images returned from galileo it was named after the dactyls creatures which inhabited mount ida in greek mythology dactyl is only 14 kilometres 4600 ft in diameter about 120 the size of ida its orbit around ida could not be determined with much accuracy but the constraints of possible orbits allowed a rough determination of idas density and revealed that it is depleted of metallic minerals dactyl and ida share many characteristics suggesting a common origin

the images returned from galileo and the subsequent measurement of idas mass provided new insights into the geology of s-type asteroids before the galileo flyby many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the earth and their origin in the asteroid belt data returned from the flyby pointed to s-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites the most common type found on the earths surface

ida was discovered on 29 september 1884 by austrian astronomer johann palisa at the vienna observatory11 it was his 45th asteroid discovery1 ida was named by moriz von kuffner a viennese brewer and amateur astronomer1213 in greek mythology ida was a nymph of crete who raised the god zeus14 ida was recognized as a member of the koronis family by kiyotsugu hirayama who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body15

idas reflection spectrum was measured on 16 september 1980 by astronomers david j tholen and edward f tedesco as part of the eight-color asteroid survey ecas16 its spectrum matched those of the asteroids in the s-type classification1718 many observations of ida were made in early 1993 by the us naval observatory in flagstaff and the oak ridge observatory these improved the measurement of idas orbit around the sun and reduced the uncertainty of its position during the galileo flyby from 78 to 60 km 48 to 37 mi19

ida was visited in 1993 by the jupiter-bound space probe galileo its encounters of the asteroids gaspra and ida were secondary to the jupiter mission these were selected as targets in response to a new nasa policy directing mission planners to consider asteroid flybys for all spacecraft crossing the belt20 no prior missions had attempted such a flyby21 galileo was launched into orbit by the space shuttle atlantis mission sts-34 on 18 october 198922 changing galileos trajectory to approach ida required that it consume 34 kg 75 lb of propellant23 mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were certain that this would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its jupiter mission24

galileos trajectory carried it into the asteroid belt twice on its way to jupiter during its second crossing it flew by ida on 28 august 1993 at a speed of 12400 ms 41000 fts relative to the asteroid24 the onboard imager observed ida from a distance of 240350 km 149350 mi to its closest approach of 2390 km 1490 mi1425 ida was the second asteroid after gaspra to be imaged by a spacecraft26 about 95 of idas surface came into view of the probe during the flyby7

transmission of many ida images was delayed due to a permanent failure in the spacecrafts high-gain antenna27 the first five images were received in september 199328 these comprised a high-resolution mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 3138 mpixel2930 the remaining images were sent in february 19942 when the spacecrafts proximity to the earth allowed higher speed transmissions2831

the data returned from the galileo flybys of gaspra and ida and the later near shoemaker asteroid mission permitted the first study of asteroid geology32 idas relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features33 the discovery of idas moon dactyl the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid provided additional insights into idas composition34

ida is classified as an s-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements35 the composition of s-types was uncertain before the galileo flybys but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the earth ordinary chondrite oc and stony-iron10 estimates of idas density are constrained to less than 32 gcm3 by the long-term stability of dactyls orbit35 this all but rules out a stony-iron composition were ida made of 5 gcm3 iron- and nickel-rich material it would have to contain more than 40 empty space34

the galileo images also led to the discovery that space weathering was taking place on ida a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time1536 the same process affects both ida and its moon although dactyl shows a lesser change37 the weathering of idas surface revealed another detail about its composition the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of oc meteorites but the older regions matched the spectra of s-type asteroids21

both of these discoveriesthe space weathering effects and the low densityled to a new understanding about the relationship between s-type asteroids and oc meteorites s-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt21 oc meteorites are likewise the most common type of meteorite found on the earths surface21 the reflection spectra measured by remote observations of s-type asteroids however did not match that of oc meteorites the galileo flyby of ida found that some s-types particularly the koronis family could be the source of these meteorites37

idas mass is between 365 and 499  1016 kg38 its gravitational field produces an acceleration of about 03 to 11 cms2 over its surface7 this field is so weak that an astronaut standing on its surface could leap from one end of ida to the other and an object moving in excess of 20 ms 70 fts could escape the asteroid entirely3940

ida is a distinctly elongated asteroid41 with an irregular surface4243 ida is 235 times as long as it is wide41 and a waist separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves28 this constricted shape is consistent with ida being made of two large solid components with loose debris filling the gap between them however no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by galileo43 although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50 on ida the slope generally does not exceed 357 idas irregular shape is responsible for the asteroids very uneven gravitational field44 the surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed it is also low near the waist because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves away from this location7

idas surface appears heavily cratered and mostly gray although minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas14 besides craters other features are evident such as grooves ridges and protrusions ida is covered by a thick layer of regolith loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath the largest boulder-sized debris fragments are called ejecta blocks several of which have been observed on the surface

the surface of ida is covered in a blanket of pulverized rock called regolith about 50100 m 160330 ft thick28 this material is produced in impact events and redistributed across idas surface by geological processes45 galileo observed evidence of recent downslope regolith movement46

idas regolith is composed of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene247 its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering37 because of this process older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material36

about 20 large 40150 m across ejecta blocks have been identified embedded in idas regolith2849 ejecta blocks constitute the largest pieces of the regolith50 because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event4451 most of them are located within the craters lascaux and mammoth but they may not have been produced there51 this area attracts debris due to idas irregular gravitational field44 some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater azzurra on the opposite side of the asteroid52

several major structures mark idas surface the asteroid appears to be split into two halves here referred to as region 1 and region 2 connected by a waist28 this feature may have been filled in by debris or blasted out of the asteroid by impacts2852

region 1 of ida contains two major structures one is a prominent 40 km 25 mi ridge named townsend dorsum that stretches 150 degrees around idas surface53 the other structure is a large indentation named vienna regio28

idas region 2 features several sets of grooves most of which are 100 m 330 ft wide or less and up to 4 km 25 mi long2854 they are located near but are not connected with the craters mammoth lascaux and kartchner50 some grooves are related to major impact events for example a set opposite vienna regio55

ida is one of the most densely cratered bodies yet explored in the solar system2942 and impacts have been the primary process shaping its surface56 cratering has reached the saturation point meaning that new impacts erase evidence of old ones leaving the total crater count roughly the same57 it is covered with craters of all sizes and stages of degradation42 and ranging in age from fresh to as old as ida itself28 the oldest may have been formed during the breakup of the koronis family parent body37 the largest crater lascaux is almost 12 km 75 mi across4358 region 2 contains nearly all of the craters larger than 6 km 37 mi in diameter but region 1 has no large craters at all28 some craters are arranged in chains30

idas major craters are named after caves and lava tubes on earth the crater azzurra for example is named after a submerged cave on the island of capri also known as the blue grotto59 azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on ida49 the ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over ida36 and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface60 an exception to the crater morphology is the fresh asymmetric fingal which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side61 another significant crater is afon which marks idas prime meridian9

the craters are simple in structure bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks61 they are distributed evenly around ida except for a protrusion north of crater choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered62 the ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation low gravity and irregular shape41 ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost63

ida was classified as an s-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids10 s-types may share their composition with stony-iron or ordinary chondrite oc meteorites10 the composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed but is assumed to be similar to oc material based on observed surface color changes and idas bulk density of 227310 gcm33764 oc meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene iron and feldspar65 olivine and pyroxene were detected on ida by galileo2 the mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent galileo found minimal variations on the surface and the asteroids spin indicates a consistent density6667 assuming that its composition is similar to oc meteorites which range in density from  348 to 364 gcm3 ida would have a porosity of 114264

idas interior probably contains some amount of impact-fractured rock called megaregolith the megaregolith layer of ida extends between hundreds of meters below the surface to a few kilometers some rock in idas core may have been fractured below the large craters mammoth lascaux and undara67

ida is a member of the koronis family of asteroid-belt asteroids15 ida orbits the sun at an average distance of 2862 au 4281 gm between the orbits of mars and jupiter23 ida takes 484089 years to complete one orbit3

idas rotation period is 463 hours841 making it one of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered68 the calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid this suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid55 idas axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years due to the gravity of the sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid69

ida originated in the breakup of the roughly 120 km 75 mi diameter koronis parent body8 the progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated with heavier metals migrating to the core70 ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material70 it is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred according to an analysis of idas cratering processes its surface is more than a billion years old70 however this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the idadactyl system of less than 100 million years71 it is unlikely that dactyl due to its small size could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer the difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the koronis parent bodys destruction72

ida has a moon named dactyl official designation 243 ida i dactyl ˈdæktɪl dak-til it was discovered in images taken by the galileo spacecraft during its flyby in 1993 these images provided the first direct confirmation of an asteroid moon34 at the time it was separated from ida by a distance of 90 kilometres 56 mi moving in a prograde orbit dactyl is heavily cratered like ida and consists of similar materials its origin is uncertain but evidence from the flyby suggests that it originated as a fragment of the koronis parent body

dactyl was found on 17 february 1994 by galileo mission member ann harch while examining delayed image downloads from the spacecraft2 galileo recorded 47 images of dactyl over an observation period of 55 hours in august 199373 the spacecraft was 10760 kilometres 6690 mi from ida74 and 10870 kilometres 6750 mi from dactyl when the first image of the moon was captured 14 minutes before galileo made its closest approach75

dactyl was initially designated 1993 243 17476 it was named by the international astronomical union in 199476 for the mythological dactyls who inhabited mount ida on the island of crete7778

dactyl is an egg-shaped34 but remarkably spherical77 object measuring 16 by 14 by 12 kilometres 099 mi  087 mi  075 mi34 it was oriented with its longest axis pointing towards ida34 like ida dactyls surface exhibits saturation cratering34 it is marked by more than a dozen craters with a diameter greater than 80 m 260 ft indicating that the moon has suffered many collisions during its history14 at least six craters form a linear chain suggesting that it was caused by locally produced debris possibly ejected from ida34 dactyls craters may contain central peaks unlike those found on ida79 these features and dactyls spheroidal shape imply that the moon is gravitationally controlled despite its small size79 like ida its average temperature is about 200 k 73 c 100 f2

dactyl shares many characteristics with ida their albedos and reflection spectra are very similar80 the small differences indicate that the space weathering process is less active on dactyl37 its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible3774 this contrasts with ida which is covered by a deep layer of regolith

the two largest imaged craters on dactyl were named acmon and celmis after two of the mythological dactyls acmon is the largest crater in the above image and celmis is near the bottom mostly obscured in shadow the craters are 300 and 200 meters in diameter respectively81

dactyls orbit around ida is not precisely known galileo was in the plane of dactyls orbit when most of the images were taken which made determining its exact orbit difficult35 dactyl orbits in the prograde direction82 and is inclined about 8 to idas equator73 based on computer simulations dactyls pericenter must be more than about 65 km 40 mi from ida for it to remain in a stable orbit83 the range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which galileo observed dactyl to be at 165205 ut on 28 august 1993 about 90 km 56 mi from ida at longitude 858485 on 26 april 1994 the hubble space telescope observed ida for eight hours and was unable to spot dactyl it would have been able to observe it if it were more than about 700 km 430 mi from ida35

if in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen dactyls orbital period would be about 20 hours80 its orbital speed is roughly 10 ms 33 fts about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball35

dactyl may have originated at the same time as ida86 from the disruption of the koronis parent body51 however it may have formed more recently perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on ida87 it is extremely unlikely that it was captured by ida75 dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago which reduced its size70

the eos and koronis families  are entirely of type s which is rare at their heliocentric distances 

nearly a month after a successful photo session the galileo spacecraft last week finished radioing to earth a high-resolution portrait of the second asteroid ever to be imaged from space known as 243 ida the asteroid was photographed from an average distance of just 3400 kilometers some 35 minutes before galileos closest approach on aug 28

the chondrites fall naturally into five composition classes of which three have very similar mineral contents but different proportions of metal and silicates all three contain abundant iron in three different forms ferrous iron oxide in silicates metallic iron and ferrous sulfide usually with all three abundant enough to be classified as potential ores all three contain feldspar an aluminosilicate of calcium sodium and potassium pyroxene silicates with one silicon atom for each atom of magnesium iron or calcium olivine silicates with two iron or magnesium atoms per silicon atom metallic iron and iron sulfide the mineral troilite these three classes referred to collectively as the ordinary chondrites contain quite different amounts of metal
