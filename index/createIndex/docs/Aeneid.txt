Aeneid


the aeneid ɪˈniːɪd latin aeneis aeˈneːɪs is a latin epic poem written by virgil between 29 and 19 bc1 that tells the legendary story of aeneas a trojan who travelled to italy where he became the ancestor of the romans it comprises 9896 lines in dactylic hexameter2 the first six of the poems twelve books tell the story of aeneass wanderings from troy to italy and the poems second half tells of the trojans ultimately victorious war upon the latins under whose name aeneas and his trojan followers are destined to be subsumed

the hero aeneas was already known to greco-roman legend and myth having been a character in the iliad virgil took the disconnected tales of aeneass wanderings his vague association with the foundation of rome and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas and fashioned the aeneid into a compelling founding myth or national epic that tied rome to the legends of troy explained the punic wars glorified traditional roman virtues and legitimized the julio-claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders heroes and gods of rome and troy

the aeneid is widely regarded as virgils masterpiece34 and one of the greatest works of latin literature56

the aeneid can be divided into two halves based on the disparate subject matter of books 16 aeneass journey to latium in italy and books 712 the war in latium these two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting virgils ambition to rival homer by treating both the odysseys wandering theme and the iliads warfare themes7 this is however a rough correspondence the limitations of which should be borne in mind8

virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme arma virumque cano  of arms and the man i sing  and an invocation to the muse falling some seven lines after the poems inception musa mihi causas memora  o muse recount to me the causes  he then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story the resentment held by the goddess juno against the trojan people this is consistent with her role throughout the homeric epics

also in the manner of homer the story proper begins in medias res into the middle of things with the trojan fleet in the eastern mediterranean heading in the direction of italy the fleet led by aeneas is on a voyage to find a second home it has been foretold that in italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous a race which will become known to all nations juno is wrathful because she had not been chosen in the judgment of paris and because her favorite city carthage will be destroyed by aeneass descendants also ganymede a trojan prince was chosen to be the cupbearer to her husband jupiterreplacing junos daughter hebe juno proceeds to aeolus king of the winds and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe deiopea the loveliest of all her sea nymphs as a wife aeolus does not accept the bribe but agrees to carry out junos orders line 77 my task is  to fulfill your commands the storm then devastates the fleet

neptune takes notice although he himself is no friend of the trojans he is infuriated by junos intrusion into his domain and stills the winds and calms the waters after making sure that the winds would not bother the trojans again lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time the fleet takes shelter on the coast of africa where aeneas rouses the spirits of his men reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before there aeneass mother venus in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess diana encourages him and recounts to him the history of carthage eventually aeneas ventures into the city and in the temple of juno he seeks and gains the favor of dido queen of the city the city has only recently been founded by refugees from tyre and will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to rome

meanwhile venus has her own plans she goes to her son aeneass half-brother cupid and tells him to imitate ascanius the son of aeneas and his first wife creusa disguised as such cupid goes to dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest with didos motherly love revived as she cradles the boy during a banquet given in honour of the trojans cupid secretly weakens her sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband sychaeus who had been murdered by her brother pygmalion

aeneas sadly recounts the events that occasioned the trojans arrival he begins the tale shortly after the war described in the iliad cunning ulysses devised a way for greek warriors to gain entry into the walled city of troy by hiding in a large wooden horse the greeks pretended to sail away leaving a warrior sinon to inform the trojans that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city the trojans would be able to conquer greece the trojan priest laocoön saw through the greek plot and urged the horses destruction but his protests fell on deaf ears so he hurled his spear at the horse then in what would be seen by the trojans as punishment from the gods two serpents emerged from the sea and devoured laocoön along with his two sons the trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls and after nightfall the armed greeks emerged from it opening the citys gates to allow the returned greek army to slaughter the trojans

in a dream hector the fallen trojan prince advised aeneas to flee with his family aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city at first he tried to fight the enemy but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off the greeks he witnessed the murder of priam by achilles son pyrrhus his mother venus appeared to him and led him back to his house aeneas tells of his escape with his son ascanius and father anchises after the occurrence of various omens ascanius head catching fire without his being harmed a clap of thunder and a shooting star after fleeing troy he goes back for his wife creusa but she has been killed her ghost tells him that his destiny is to found a new city in the west

he tells of how rallying the other survivors he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the mediterranean thrace where they find the last remains of a fellow trojan polydorus crete which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city which they name pergamea but they are set straight by apollo the strophades where they encounter the harpy celaeno who tells them to leave her island and to look for italy and buthrotum this last city had been built in an attempt to replicate troy in buthrotum aeneas meets andromache the widow of hector she is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child there too aeneas sees and meets helenus one of priams sons who has the gift of prophecy through him aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him he is divinely advised to seek out the land of italy also known as ausonia or hesperia where his descendants will not only prosper but in time rule the entire known world in addition helenus also bids him go to the sibyl in cumae

heading into the open sea aeneas leaves buthrotum rounds the south eastern tip of italy and makes his way towards sicily trinacria there they are caught in the whirlpool of charybdis and driven out to sea soon they come ashore at the land of the cyclopes there they meet a greek achaemenides one of ulysses men who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of polyphemus they take achaemenides on board and narrowly escape polyphemus shortly after anchises dies peacefully of old age and aeneas sails to carthage

aeneas finishes his story and dido realizes that she has fallen in love with aeneas juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with venus aeneass mother with the intention of distracting aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in italy aeneas is inclined to return didos love and during a hunting expedition a storm drives them into a small covered grove in which aeneas and dido presumably made love an event that dido takes to indicate a marriage between them but when jupiter sends mercury to remind aeneas of his duty he has no choice but to part her heart broken dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with aeneass sword before dying she predicts eternal strife between aeneass people and hers rise up from my bones avenging spirit 4625 trans fitzgerald is a possible invocation to hannibal9 looking back from the deck of his ship aeneas sees the smoke of didos funeral pyre and knows its meaning only too clearly nevertheless destiny calls and the trojan fleet sails on to italy

book 5 takes place on sicily and centers on the funeral games that aeneas organizes for the anniversary of his fathers death aeneas and his men have left carthage for sicily where aeneas organizes celebratory gamesa boat race a foot race a boxing match and an archery contest in all those contests aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events the boxing match for instance is a preview of the final encounter of aeneas and turnus and the dove the target during the archery contest is connected to the deaths of polites and king priam in book 2 and that of camilla in book 1110 afterwards ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle a tradition he will teach the latins while building the walls of alba longa

during these events in which only men participate juno incites the womenfolk to burn the fleet and prevent the trojans from ever reaching italy but her plan is thwarted when ascanius and aeneas intervene aeneas prays to jupiter to quench the fires which the god does with a torrential rainstorm an anxious aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and romes future in return for safe passage to italy the gods by order of jupiter will receive one of aeneass men as a sacrifice palinurus who steers aeneass ship by night falls overboard

in book 6 aeneas with the guidance of the cumaean sibyl descends into the underworld they pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river acheron and are ferried across by charon before passing by cerberus the three-headed guardian of the underworld then aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in tartarus and is warned by the sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods he is then brought to green fields of elysium there he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of rome

upon returning to the land of the living aeneas leads the trojans to settle in latium where he courts lavinia the daughter of king latinus although aeneas wished to avoid a war hostilities break out juno is heavily involved in bringing about this warshe has persuaded the queen of latium to demand that lavinia be married to turnus the ruler of another local people the rutuli juno continues to stir up trouble even summoning the fury alecto to ensure that a war takes place

seeing the masses of warriors that turnus has brought against him aeneas seeks help from the tuscans enemies of the rutuli he meets king evander of arcadia whose son pallas agrees to lead troops against the rutuli meanwhile in book 9 the trojan camp is attacked and a midnight raid leads to the deaths of nisus and his companion euryalus the gates however are defended until aeneas returns with his tuscan and arcadian reinforcements

in the battling that follows many are slainnotably pallas a close friend of aeneas who is killed by turnus and mezentius turnuss close associate mezentius who has allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled reproaches himself and faces aeneas in single combatan honourable but essentially futile endeavour in book 11 another notable camilla a sort of amazon character fights bravely but is killed she has been a virgin devoted to diana and to her nation arruns the man who kills her is struck dead by dianas sentinel opis

single combat is then proposed between aeneas and turnus but aeneas is so obviously superior to turnus that the rutuli urged on by turnuss divine sister juturna break the truce aeneas is injured but returns to the battle turnus and aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings but when aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of latium causing the queen of latium to hang herself in despair he forces turnus into single combat once more turnuss strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock and aeneass spear goes through his thigh as turnus is on his knees  begging for his life the epic ends with aeneas first tempted to obey pleas to spare turnuss life but killing him in rage when he sees that turnus is wearing his friend pallass belt over a shoulder as a trophy

critics of the aeneid focus on a variety of issues11 the tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the augustan regime while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty virgil makes use of the symbolism of the augustan regime and some scholars see strong associations between augustus and aeneas the one as founder and the other as re-founder of rome a strong teleology or drive towards a climax has been detected in the poem the aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of rome the deeds of augustus his ancestors and famous romans and the carthaginian wars the shield of aeneas even depicts augustus victory at actium in 31 bc a further focus of study is the character of aeneas as the protagonist of the poem aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found rome critics note the breakdown of aeneass emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the pious and righteous aeneas mercilessly slaughters the latin warrior turnus

the aeneid appears to have been a great success virgil is said to have recited books 2 4 and 6 to augustus12 the mention of her son marcellus in book 6 apparently caused augustus sister octavia to faint the poem was unfinished when virgil died in 19 bc

according to tradition virgil traveled to greece around 19 bc to revise the aeneid after meeting augustus in athens and deciding to return home virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near megara virgil crossed to italy by ship weakened with disease and died in brundisium harbour on 21 september 19 bc leaving a wish that the manuscript of the aeneid was to be burned augustus ordered virgils literary executors lucius varius rufus and plotius tucca to disregard that wish instead ordering the aeneid to be published with as few editorial changes as possible13 as a result the existing text of the aeneid may contain faults which virgil was planning to correct before publication however the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ie not a complete line of dactylic hexameter other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate

the aeneid was written in a time of major political and social change in rome with the fall of the republic and the final war of the roman republic having torn through society and many romans faith in the greatness of rome severely faltering however the new emperor augustus caesar began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace specifically through the re-introduction of traditional roman moral values the aeneid was seen as reflecting this aim by depicting the heroic aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence rather than his own personal gains in addition the aeneid gives mythic legitimization to the rule of julius caesar and by extension to his adopted son augustus by immortalizing the tradition that renamed aeneass son ascanius called ilus from ilium meaning troy iulus thus making him an ancestor of the gens julia the family of julius caesar and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the underworld the meter shows that the name iulus is pronounced as 3 syllables not as julus

despite the polished and complex nature of the aeneid legend stating that virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that virgil died before he could finish the work because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally the aeneid is more complete than most classical epics furthermore it is possible to debate whether virgil intended to rewrite and add to such lines some of them would be difficult to complete and in some instances the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact some arguing the violent ending as a typically virgilian comment on the darker vengeful side of humanity however these arguments may be anachronistichalf-finished lines might equally to roman readers have been a clear indication of an unfinished poem and have added nothing whatsoever to the dramatic effectcitation needed

the perceived deficiency of any account of aeneass marriage to lavinia or his founding of the roman race led some writers such as the 15th-century italian poet maffeo vegio through his mapheus vegius widely printed in the renaissance pier candido decembrio whose attempt was never completed claudio salvucci in his 1994 epic poem the laviniad and ursula k le guin in her 2008 novel lavinia to compose their own supplements

some legends state that virgil fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem gave instructions to friends including the current emperor augustus that the aeneid should be burned upon his death owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in book viii in which venus and vulcan made love for its nonconformity to roman moral virtues the friends did not comply with virgils wishes and augustus himself ordered that they be disregarded after minor modifications the aeneid was published

the first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an anglic language is the scots translation by gavin douglashis eneados completed in 1513 which also included maffeo vegios supplement even in the 20th century ezra pound considered this still to be the best aeneid translation praising the richness and fervour of its language and its hallmark fidelity to the original1415 the english translation by the 17th-century poet john dryden is another important version most classic translations including both douglas and dryden employ a rhyme scheme most more modern attempts do not

recent english verse translations include those by british poet laureate cecil day-lewis 1963 which strove to render virgils original hexameter line allen mandelbaum honoured by a 1973 national book award library of congress poet laureate robert fitzgerald 1981 stanley lombardo 2005 robert fagles 2006 sarah ruden 2008 and barry b powell 2015

as with other classical latin poetry the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress though the interplay of meter and stress is also important virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as alliteration onomatopoeia synecdoche and assonance furthermore he uses personification metaphor and simile in his work usually to add drama and tension to the scene an example of a simile can be found in book ii when aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him16 it can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep so too is aeneas to his people

as was the rule in classical antiquity an authors style was seen as an expression of his personality and character virgils latin has been praised for its evenness subtlety and dignitycitation needed

the aeneid like other classical epics is written in dactylic hexameters each line consists of six metrical feet made up of dactyls one long syllable followed by two short syllables and spondees two long syllables this epic consists of twelve books and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each respectively addressing dido the trojans arrival in italy and the war with the latins each book has about 1000 lines the aeneid comes to an abrupt ending and scholars have speculated that virgil died before he could finish the poem17

the roman ideal of pietas piety dutiful respect which can be loosely translated from the latin as a selfless sense of duty toward ones
filial religious and societal obligations was a crux of ancient roman morality throughout the aeneid aeneas serves as the embodiment of
pietas with the phrase pious aeneas occurring 20 times throughout the poem18 thereby fulfilling his capacity as the father of the roman people19
for instance in book 2 aeneas describes how he carried his father anchises from the burning city of troy  no help or hope of help existed
so i resigned myself picked up my father and turned my face toward the mountain range20  furthermore aeneas ventures into the underworld thereby fulfilling anchises
wishes his fathers gratitude is presented in the text by the following lines  have you at last come has that loyalty your father counted on conquered the journey
21

however aeneass pietas extends beyond his devotion to his father we also see several examples of his religious fervour aeneas is consistently subservient to the gods even in actions opposed to his own desires as he responds to one such divine command i sail to italy not of my own free will2223

in addition to his religious and familial pietas aeneas also displays fervent patriotism and devotion to his people particularly in a military capacity for instance as he and his followers leave troy aeneas swears that he will take up the combat once again we shall not all die this day unavenged24

aeneas is a symbol of pietas in all of its forms serving as a moral paragon to whom a roman should aspire

one of the most recurring themes in the aeneid is that of divine intervention25 throughout the poem the gods are constantly influencing the main characters and trying to change and impact the outcome regardless of the fate that they all know will occur26 for example juno comes down and acts as a phantom aeneas to drive turnus away from the real aeneas and all of his rage from the death of pallas27 even though juno knows in the end that aeneas will triumph over turnus she does all she can to delay and avoid this outcome

divine intervention occurs multiple times in book 4 especially aeneas falls in love with dido delaying his ultimate fate of traveling to italy however it is actually the gods who inspired the love as juno plots

dido and the trojan captain will come
to one same cavern i shall be on hand
and if i can be certain you are willing
there i shall marry them and call her his
a wedding this will be28

juno is speaking to venus making an agreement and influencing the lives and emotions of both dido and aeneas later in the same book jupiter steps in and restores what is the true fate and path for aeneas sending mercury down to aeneass dreams telling him that he must travel to italy and leave his new-found lover as aeneas later pleads with dido

the gods interpreter sent by jove himself 
i swear it by your head and mine  has brought
commands down through the racing winds
i sail for italy not of my own free will29

several of the gods try to intervene against the powers of fate even though they know what the eventual outcome will be the interventions are really just distractions to continue the conflict and postpone the inevitable if the gods represent humans just as the human characters engage in conflicts and power struggles so too do the gods

fate described as a preordained destiny that men and gods have to follow is a major theme in the aeneid one example is when aeneas is reminded of his fate through jupiter and mercury while he is falling in love with dido mercury urges think of your expectations of your heir iulus to whom the whole italian realm the land of rome are due30 mercury is referring to aeneass preordained fate to found rome as well as romes preordained fate to rule the world

he was to be ruler of italy
potential empire armorer of war
to father men from teucers noble blood
and bring the whole world under laws dominion31

it is important to recognize that there is a marked difference between fate and divine intervention as even though the gods might remind mortals of their eventual fate the gods themselves are not in control of it32 for example the opening lines of the poem specify that aeneas came to italy by destiny but is also harassed by the separate force of baleful juno in her sleepless rage33 even though juno might intervene aeneass fate is set in stone and cannot be changed

later in book 6 when aeneas visits the underworld his father anchises introduces him to the larger fate of the roman people as contrasted against his own personal fate to found rome

so raptly everywhere father and son
wandered the airy plain and viewed it all
after anchises had conducted him
to every region and had fired his love
of glory in the years to come he spoke
of wars that he might fight of laurentines
and of latinus city then of how
he might avoid or bear each toil to come34

from the very beginning of the aeneid violence and conflict are used as a means of survival and conquest aeneass voyage is caused by the trojan war and the destruction of
troy35  aeneas describes to dido in book 2 the massive amount of destruction that occurs after the greeks sneak into troy he recalls that he asks his men to defend a city
lost in flames come let us die well make a rush into the thick of it36
this is one of the first examples of how violence begets violence even though the trojans know they have lost the battle they continue to fight for their country

this violence continues as aeneas makes his journey dido kills herself in an excessively violent way over a pyre in order to end and escape her worldly problem being heartbroken
over the departure of her husband aeneas queen didos suicide is a double edged sword while releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence her last words
implore her people to view aeneass people with hate for all eternity

this is my last cry as my last blood flows
then o my tyrians besiege with hate
his progeny and all his race to come
make this your offering to my dust no love
no pact must be between our peoples37

furthermore her people hearing of their queens death have only one avenue on which to direct the blame the already-departed trojans thus didos request of her people
and her peoples only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for aeneas and his trojans in effect didos violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the
later relationship between carthage and rome38

finally when aeneas arrives in latium conflict inevitably arises39  juno sends alecto one of the furies to cause turnus to go against aeneas in the ensuing battles turnus
kills pallas who is supposed to be under aeneass protection this act of violence causes aeneas to be consumed with fury although turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter
when aeneas sees that turnus has taken pallas sword belt aeneas proclaims

you in your plunder torn from one of mine
shall i be robbed of you  this wound will come
from pallas pallas makes this offering
and from your criminal blood exacts his due40

this final act of violence shows how turnus violencethe act of killing pallasinevitably leads to more violence and his own death

it is possible that the recurring theme of violence in the aeneid is a subtle commentary on the bloody violence contemporary readers would have just experienced during the late republican
civil wars  the aeneid potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under augustus or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future41

written during the reign of augustus the aeneid presents the hero aeneas as a strong and powerful leader the favorable representation of aeneas parallels
augustus in that it portrays his reign in a progressive and admirable light and allows augustus to be positively associated with the portrayal of aeneas42
although virgils patron maecenas was obviously not augustus himself he was still a high figure within augustus administration and could have personally
benefitted from representing aeneas in a positive light

in the aeneid aeneas is portrayed as the singular hope for the rebirth of the trojan people charged with the preservation of his people by divine authority aeneas is symbolic of augustus own accomplishments in establishing order after the long period of chaos of the roman civil wars augustus as the light of savior and the last
hope of the roman people is a parallel to aeneas as the savior of the trojans this parallel functions as propaganda in support of augustus4344 as it depicts the trojan people
future romans themselves as uniting behind a single leader who will lead them out of ruin

new refugees in a great crowd men and women
gathered for exile young-pitiful people
coming from every quarter minds made up
with their belongings for whatever lands
id lead them to by sea45

later in book 6 aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father anchises who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of
the roman people anchises describes how aeneass descendant romulus will found the great city of rome
which will eventually be ruled by caesar augustus

turn your two eyes
this way and see this people your own romans
here is caesar and all the line of iulus
all who shall one day pass under the dome
of the great sky this is the man this one
of whom so often you have heard the promise
caesar augustus son of the deified
who shall bring once again an age of gold
to latium to the land where saturn reigned
in early times46

virgil writes about the fated future of lavinium the city that aeneas will found which will in turn lead directly to the
golden reign of augustus virgil is using a form of literary propaganda to demonstrate the augustan
regimes destiny to bring glory and peace to rome rather than use aeneas indirectly as a positive parallel
to augustus as in other parts of the poem virgil outright praises the emperor in book 6 referring to augustus as a harbinger for the glory
of rome and new levels of prosperity

the poem abounds with smaller and greater allegories two of the debated allegorical sections pertain to the exit from the underworld and to pallass belt

aeneass leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted one suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which aeneas returned to the world of the living another is that it implies that all of aeneass actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow false in an extension of the latter interpretation it has been suggested that virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of rome is but a lie other scholars claim that virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene an apparent system of reincarnation are not to be taken as literal47

the second section in question is

this section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem aeneas who symbolizes pietas reason in a moment becomes furor fury thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself many have argued over these two sections some claim that virgil meant to change them before he died while others find that the location of the two passages at the very end of the so-called volume i books 16 the odyssey and volume ii books 712 the iliad and their short length which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem are evidence that virgil placed them purposefully there

the aeneid is a cornerstone of the western canon and early at least by the 2nd century ad became one of the essential elements of a latin education49 usually required to be memorized50 even after the decline of the roman empire it remained central to a latin education51 in latin-christian culture the aeneid was one of the canonical texts subjected to commentary as a philological and educational study52 with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian maurus servius honoratus53 it was widely held to be the pinnacle of latin literature much in the same way that the iliad was seen to be supreme in greek literature

the strong influence of the aeneid has been identified in the development of european vernacular literaturessome english works that show its influence being beowulf layamons brut through the source text historia regum britanniae the faerie queene and miltons paradise lost the italian poet dante alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the aeneid so much so that his magnum opus the divine comedy itself widely considered central to the western canon includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the aeneid and features the author virgil as a major character  the guide of dante through the realms of the inferno and purgatorio another continental work displaying the influence of the aeneid is the 16th-century portuguese epic os lusíadas written by luís de camões and dealing with vasco da gamas voyage to india

the importance of latin education itself was paramount in western culture from 1600 to 1900 the latin school was at the center of european education wherever it was found within that latin school virgil was taught at the advanced level and in 19th-century england special editions of virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves54 in the united states virgil and specifically the aeneid were taught in the fourth year of a latin sequence at least until the 1960s55 the current 2011 advanced placement curriculum in latin continues to assign a central position to the poem the ap latin virgil exam is designed to test the students ability to read translate understand analyze and interpret the lines of the aeneid that appear on the course syllabus in latin56

many phrases from this poem entered the latin language much as passages from shakespeare and alexander pope have entered the english language one example is from aeneass reaction to a painting of the sack of troy sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tanguntthese are the tears of things and our mortality cuts to the heart aeneid i 462 the influence is also visible in very modern work brian friels translations a play written in the 1980s set in 19th-century ireland makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the aeneid

urbs antiqua fuitthere was an ancient city which tis said juno loved above all the lands and it was the goddesss aim and cherished hope that here should be the capital of all nationsshould the fates perchance allow that yet in truth she discovered that a race was springing from trojan blood to overthrow some day these tyrian towersa people late regem belloque superbumkings of broad realms and proud in war who would come forth for libyas downfall57
the aeneid was the basis for the 1962 italian film the avenger

in the musical spring awakening based on the play of the same title by frank wedekind schoolboys study the latin text and the first verse of book 1 is incorporated into the number all thats known

ursula le guins 2008 novel lavinia is a free prose retelling of the last six books of the aeneid narrated by and centered on aeneas latin wife lavinia a minor character in the epic poem it carries the action forward to the crowning of aeneas younger son silvius as king of latium

a seventeenth-century popular broadside ballad also appears to recount events from books 14 of the aeneid focusing mostly on the relationship between aeneas and dido the ballad the wandering prince of troy presents many similar elements as virgils epic but alters didos final sentiments toward aeneas as well as presents an interesting end for aeneas himself58
