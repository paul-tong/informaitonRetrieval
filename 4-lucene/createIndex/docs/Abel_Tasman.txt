Abel_Tasman


abel janszoon tasman dutch ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn 1603  10 october 1659 was a dutch seafarer explorer and merchant best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the dutch east india company voc he was the first known european explorer to reach the islands of van diemens land now tasmania and new zealand and to sight the fiji islands

tasman originated from lutjegast a small village in the province of groningen in the north of the netherlands
the oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 december 1631 when as a seafarer living in amsterdam the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old jannetje tjaers of palmstraat in the jordaan district of the city34

employed by the dutch east india company voc tasman sailed from texel to batavia in 1633 taking the southern brouwer route during this period tasman took part in a voyage to seram island the locals had sold spices to other european nationalities than the dutch he had a narrow escape from death when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by people of seram5

in august 1637 tasman was back in amsterdam and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to batavia on 25 march 1638 he tried to sell his property in the jordaan but the purchase was cancelled

he was second-in-command of a 1639 exploration expedition in the north pacific under matthijs quast the fleet included the ships engel and gracht and reached fort zeelandia dutch formosa and deshima

in august 1642 the council of the indies consisting of antonie van diemen cornelis van der lijn joan maetsuycker justus schouten salomon sweers cornelis witsen and pieter boreel in batavia despatched tasman and franchoijs jacobszoon visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the cape of good hope west of staten land near cape horn south america and south of the solomon islands6

one of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of all the totally unknown provinces of beach7 a purported yet non-existent landmass with plentiful gold which had appeared on european maps since the 15th century as a result of an error in some editions of marco polos works  see the box right for more information

this expedition was to use two small ships heemskerck and zeehaen

in accordance with visschers directions tasman sailed from batavia on 14 august 16428 and arrived at mauritius on 5 september 1642 according to the captains journal9 the reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships tasman got the assistance of the governor adriaan van der stel

because of the prevailing winds mauritius was chosen as a turning point after a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 october using the roaring forties to sail east as fast as possible no one had gone as far as pieter nuyts in 162627 on 7 november snow and hail influenced the ships council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction10 expecting to arrive one day at the solomon islands

on 24 november 1642 abel tasman reached and sighted the west coast of tasmania north of macquarie harbour11 he named his discovery van diemens land after antonio van diemen governor-general of the dutch east indies

proceeding south tasman skirted the southern end of tasmania and turned north-east he then tried to work his two ships into adventure bay on the east coast of south bruny island where he was blown out to sea by a storm this area he named storm bay two days later tasman anchored to the north of cape frederick hendrick just north of the forestier peninsula tasman then landed in blackman bay  in the larger marion bay the next day an attempt was made to land in north bay however because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the dutch flag tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 december 164212

for two more days he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went when the land veered to the north-west at eddystone point13 he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by  the roaring forties howling through banks strait14 the impenetrable wind wall indicated that here was a strait not a bay tasman was on a mission to find the southern continent not more islands so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting15

after some exploration tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east the expedition endured an extremely rough voyage and in one of his diary entries tasman credited his compass claiming it was the only thing that had kept him alive

on 13 december 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the south island new zealand becoming the first europeans to do so17 tasman named it staten landt in honour of the states general dutch parliament18 he wrote it is possible that this land joins to the staten land but it is uncertain19 referring to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america discovered by jacob le maire in 161620 he continued we believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown southland21 tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined terra australis that stretched across the pacific to near the southern tip of south america22


after sailing north then east for five days the expedition anchored about 7 km from the coast off what is now believed to have been golden bay tasman sent ships boats to gather water but one of his boats was attacked by māori in a double hulled waka canoe and four of his men were killed with mere clubs mw-parser-output templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmw-parser-output templatequote templatequoteciteline-height15emtext-alignleftpadding-left16emmargin-top0
in the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore two of which betook themselves towards us when our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water and with the sinking of the sun which sank behind the high land they had been still about half a mile from the shore after our people had been on board about one glass people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff hollow voices we could not in the least understand any of it however when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer but they did not come nearer than a stones shot they also blew many times on an instrument which produced a sound like the moors trumpets we had one of our sailors who could play somewhat on the trumpet play some tunes to them in answer9

 as tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore of which eleven swarming with people came off towards us the waka approached the zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag canister shot also hit the side of a waka923 archeological research has shown the dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area which the māori may have been trying to protect24 tasman named the area murderers bay

the expedition then sailed north sighting cook strait which it mistook for a bight and named zeehaens bight two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of new zealand still endure cape maria van diemen and three kings islands  kaap pieter boreels was renamed cape egmont by captain james cook 125 years later

en route back to batavia tasman came across the tongan archipelago on 20 january 1643 while passing the fiji islands tasmans ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the fiji group he charted the eastern tip of vanua levu and cikobia before making his way back into the open sea

the expedition turned north-west towards new guinea and arrived at batavia on 15 june 164312

tasman left batavia on 30 january 1644 on his second voyage with three ships limmen zeemeeuw and the tender braek he followed the south coast of new guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of new holland however he missed the torres strait between new guinea and australia probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes and continued his voyage by following the shore of the gulf of carpentaria westwards along the north australian coast he mapped the north coast of australia making observations on new holland and its people25 he arrived back in batavia in august 1644

from the point of view of the dutch east india company tasmans explorations were a disappointment he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route although received modestly the company was upset to a degree that tasman did not fully explore the lands he found and decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for any future expeditions26 for over a century until the era of james cook tasmania and new zealand were not visited by europeans  mainland australia was visited but usually only by accident

on 2 november 1644 abel tasman was appointed a member of the council of justice at batavia he went to sumatra in 1646 and in august 1647 to siam now thailand with letters from the company to the king in may 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to manila to try to intercept and loot the spanish silver ships coming from america but he had no success and returned to batavia in january 1649 in november 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial was suspended from his office of commander fined and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor on 5 january 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at batavia he was in good circumstances being one of the larger landowners in the town he died at batavia on 10 october 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife his property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage in his testimony dating from 165727 he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village lutjegast28

although tasmans pilot frans visscher published memoir concerning the discovery of the south land in 1642 tasmans detailed journal was not published until 1898 however some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers25

tasmans ten-month voyage in 1642-43 had significant consequences by circumnavigating australia albeit at a distance tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent such as the long-imagined southern continent further tasmans suggestion that new zealand was the western side of that southern continent was seized upon by many european cartographers who for the next century depicted new zealand as the west coast of a terra australis rising gradually from the waters around tierra del fuego this theory was eventually disproved when captain cook circumnavigated new zealand in 176929

multiple places have been named after tasman including

also named after tasman are

his portrait has been on 4 new zealand postage stamp issues on a 1992 5 nzd coin and on one 1985 australian postage stamp30

in the netherlands many streets are named after him in lutjegast the village he was born there is a museum dedicated to his life and travels

held within the collection of the state library of new south wales is the tasman map thought to have been drawn by isaac gilsemans or completed under the supervision of franz jacobszoon visscher31 the map is also known as the bonaparte map as it was once owned by prince roland bonaparte the great-nephew of napoleon32 the map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during tasmans first and second voyages33 as none of the journals or logs composed during tasmans second voyage have survived the bonaparte map remains as an important contemporary artefact of tasmans voyage to the northern coast of the australian continent33

the tasman map largely reveals the extent of understanding the dutch had of the australian continent at the time34 the map includes the western and southern coasts of australia accidentally encountered by dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the cape of good hope to the voc  headquarters in batavia32 in addition the map shows the tracks of tasmans two voyages32 of his second voyage the map shows the area of the banda islands the southern coast of new guinea and much of the northern coast of australia however the area of the torres strait is shown unexamined this is despite having been given orders by voc council at batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between new guinea and the australian continent3334

there is debate as to the origin of the map35 it is widely believed that the map was produced in batavia however it has also been argued that the map was produced in amsterdam3235 the authorship of the map has also been debated while the map is commonly attributed to tasman it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration probably involving franchoijs visscher and isaack gilseman who took part in both of tasmans voyages735 whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate as a voc company report in december 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing tasmans voyages were yet complete35

in 1943 a mosaic version of the map composed of coloured marble and brass was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the mitchell library in sydney36 the work was commissioned by the principal librarian william ifould and completed by the melocco brothers of annandale who also worked on anzac war memorial in hyde park and the crypt at st marys cathedral sydney3731
