Aether_(classical_element)
according to ancient and medieval science aether ancient greek αἰθήρ aither1 also spelled æther or ether and also called quintessence is the material that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere2 the concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena such as the traveling of light and gravity in the late 19th century physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space providing a medium through which light could travel in a vacuum but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the michelsonmorley experiment and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such luminiferous aether exists3

the word  αἰθήρ aithēr in homeric greek means pure fresh air or clear sky in greek mythology it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed filling the space where they lived analogous to the air breathed by mortals4 it is also personified as a deity aether the son of erebus and nyx in traditional greek mythology45 aether is related to αἴθω to incinerate6 and intransitive to burn to shine related is the name aithiopes ethiopians see aethiopia meaning people with a burnt black visage78

in platos timaeus 58d speaking about air plato mentions that there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether αίθηρ9 but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements aristotle who had been platos student at the akademia agreed on this point with his former mentor emphasizing additionally that fire sometimes has been mistaken for aether however in his book on the heavens he introduced a new first element to the system of the classical elements of ionian philosophy he noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly the first element however located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had it was neither hot nor cold neither wet nor dry with this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it aether a word that aristotle had not used10

aether did not follow aristotelian physics either aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity aether was only capable of local motion aether naturally moved in circles and had no contrary or unnatural motion11 aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies the idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to aristotles explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether2

medieval scholastic philosophers granted aether changes of density in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe12 robert fludd stated that the aether was of the character that it was subtler than light fludd cites the 3rd-century view of plotinus concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material13 see also arche

quintessence is the latinate name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies it was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere due to the low presence of quintessence earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies14 this theory was developed in the 14th century text the testament of lullius attributed to ramon llull the use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system which consisted of the four classical elements and aether or quintessence in addition to two chemical elements representing metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties

this elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of europe and became popular with alchemists especially in medicinal alchemy medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs14 due to quintessences pure and heavenly quality it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses in the book of quintessence a 15th-century english translation of a continental text quintessence was used as a medicine for many of mans illnesses a process given for the creation of quintessence is distillation of alcohol seven times15 over the years the term quintessence has become synonymous with elixirs medicinal alchemy and the philosophers stone itself16

with the 18th century physics developments physical models known as aether theories made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces as early as the 1670s newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics17  however the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed these aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete as the development of special relativity showed that maxwells equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces however einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties18

despite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models19 one proposed model of dark energy has been named quintessence by its proponents in honor of the classical element20 this idea relates to the hypothecial form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe it has also been called a fifth fundamental force

the motion of light was a long-standing investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the 20th century the use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries including a theory proposed by johann ii bernoulli who was recognized in 1736 with the prize of the french academy in his theory all space is permeated by aether containing excessively small whirlpools these whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through21

this theory of luminiferous aether would influence the wave theory of light proposed by christiaan huygens in which light traveled in the form of longitudinal waves  via an omnipresent perfectly elastic medium having zero density called aether at the time it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate as sound through air or ripples in a pool later when it was proved that the nature of light wave is transverse instead of longitudinal huygens theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by maxwell einstein and de broglie which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena these theories were supported by the results of the michelsonmorley experiment in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent22 the results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of einsteins theory of special relativity23

aether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it it was used in one of sir isaac newtons first published theories of gravitation philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica the principia he based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions he renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium24 he calls this intervening medium aether in his aether model newton describes aether as a medium that flows continually downward toward the earths surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused this circulation of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion24 this theory described different aether densities creating an aether density gradient his theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them as particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water25 in the principia he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids this elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place according to this early theory and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to robert boyle in 167925 he illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform robert boyle about his theory26 although newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion his starting point for the modern understanding and explanation of gravity came from his original aether model on gravitation27
