25143 itokawa ˌiːtoʊˈkɑːwə japanese イトカワいとかわ糸川 itokaɰa is a stony sub-kilometer asteroid classified as near-earth object of the apollo group and potentially hazardous asteroid that measures approximately 350 meters in diameter it was the first asteroid to be the target of a sample return mission the japanese space probe hayabusa and the smallest asteroid photographed and visited by a spacecraft

the asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the linear project at the lincoln laboratorys experimental test site in socorro new mexico it was given the provisional designation 1998 sf36 this minor planet was named after hideo itokawa 19121999 a japanese rocket scientist23 the official naming citation was published in the minor planet center on 6 august 2003 mpc 4928124

itokawa is an s-type asteroid radar imaging by goldstone in 2001 observed an ellipsoid 630  60 m long and 250  30 m wide2526

the hayabusa mission confirmed these findings and also suggested that itokawa may be a contact binary formed by two or more smaller asteroids that have gravitated toward each other and stuck together the hayabusa images show a surprising lack of impact craters and a very rough surface studded with boulders described by the mission team as a rubble pile27  furthermore the density of the asteroid is too low for it to be made from solid rock this would mean that itokawa is not a monolith but rather a rubble pile formed from fragments that have cohered over time based on yarkovskyokeeferadzievskiipaddack effect measurements a small section of itokawa is estimated to have a density of 29 gcm³ whereas a larger section is estimated to have a density of 18 gcm³28

in 2000 it was selected as the target of japans hayabusa mission  the probe arrived in the vicinity of itokawa on 12 september 2005 and initially parked in an asteroidsun line at 20 km 12 mi and later 7 km 43 mi from the asteroid itokawas gravity was too weak to provide an orbit so the spacecraft adjusted its orbit around the sun until it matched the asteroids hayabusa landed on 20 november for thirty minutes but it failed to operate a device designed to collect soil samples on 25 november a second landing and sampling sequence was attempted the sample capsule was returned to earth and landed at woomera south australia on 13 june 2010 around 1351 utc 2321 local on 16 november 2010 the japan aerospace exploration agency reported that dust collected during hayabusas voyage was indeed from the asteroid29

names of major surface features were proposed by hayabusa scientists and accepted by the working group for planetary system nomenclature of the international astronomical union also the hayabusa science team is using working names for smaller surface features3031 the following tables list the names of geological features on the asteroid32 no naming conventions have been disclosed for surface features on itokawa

regiones geologically distinct areas on itokawa

the 26 august 2011 issue of science devoted six articles to findings based on dust that hayabusa had collected from itokawa34  scientists analysis suggested that itokawa was probably made up from interior fragments of a larger asteroid that broke apart35  dust collected from the asteroid surface is thought to have been exposed there for about eight million years34

scientists used varied techniques of chemistry and  mineralogy to analyze the dust from itokawa35 itokawas composition was found to match the common type of meteorites known as low-total-iron low metal ordinary chondrites36 another team of scientists determined that the dark iron color on the surface of itokawa was the result of abrasion by micrometeoroids and high-speed particles from the sun which had converted the normally whitish iron oxide coloring36

two separate groups report water in different itokawa particles

jin et al report water in low-calcium pyroxene grains the waters isotope level corresponds with inner solar system and carbonaceous chondrite water isotope levels37

daly et al report oh and h2o apparently formed by implantation of solar wind hydrogen the rims of an olivine particle show an enrichment of up to 12 at  in oh and h2038

the water concentrations of the itokawa grains would indicate an estimated bsi bulk silicate itokawa water content in line with earths bulk water and that itokawa had been a water-rich asteroid39
