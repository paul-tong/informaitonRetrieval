the pioneer program was a series of united states unmanned space missions that were designed for planetary exploration there were a number of such missions in the program but the most notable were pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 which explored the outer planets and left the solar system pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 carry a golden plaque depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes should any extraterrestrials find them someday naming credit for naming the first probe has been attributed to stephen a saliga who had been assigned to the air force orientation group wright-patterson afb as chief designer of air force exhibits while he was at a briefing the spacecraft was described to him as a lunar-orbiting vehicle with an infrared scanning device saliga thought the title too long and lacked theme for an exhibit design he suggested pioneer as the name of the probe since the army had already launched and orbited the explorer satellite and their public information office was identifying the army as pioneers in space and by adopting the name the air force would make a quantum jump as to who really were the pioneers in space early pioneer missions the earliest missions were attempts to achieve earths escape velocity simply to show it was feasible and study the moon this included the first launch by nasa which was formed from the old naca these missions were carried out by the us air force and army able space probes 19581960 pioneer 0 thor-able 1 pioneer lunar orbiter destroyed thor failure 77seconds after launch august 17 1958

achieved earth escape velocity launched march 3 1959 later pioneer missions 19651978 five years after the early able space probe missions ended nasa ames research center used the pioneer name for a new series of missions initially aimed at the inner solar system before the bold flyby missions to jupiter and saturn while successful the missions returned much poorer images than the voyager program probes would five years later in 1978 the end of the program saw a return to the inner solar system with the pioneer venus orbiter and multiprobe this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions the new missions were numbered beginning with pioneer 6 alternate names in parentheses pioneer 6 7 8 and 9 the spacecraft in pioneer missions 6 7 8 and 9 comprised a new interplanetary space weather network pioneer 6 pioneer a launched december 1965 pioneer 7 pioneer b launched august 1966 pioneer 8 pioneer c launched december 1967 pioneer 9 pioneer d launched november 1968 inactive since 1983 pioneer e lost in launcher failure august 1969 pioneer 6 and pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 08 au distance to the sun their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than earths pioneer 7 and pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 11 au distance to the sun their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than earths since the probes orbital periods differ from that of the earth from time to time they face a side of the sun that cannot be seen from earth the probes can sense parts of the sun several days before the suns rotation reveals it to ground-based earth orbiting observatories outer solar system missions pioneer 10 pioneer f jupiter interstellar medium launched march 1972 pioneer 11 pioneer g jupiter saturn interstellar medium launched april 1973 pioneer h identical to pioneers 10 and 11 proposed out-of-the-ecliptic mission for 1974 but was not built pioneer venus project pioneer venus orbiter pioneer venus 1 pioneer 12 launched may 1978 pioneer venus
