a city is a large human settlement cities generally have extensive systems for housing transportation sanitation utilities land use and communication their density facilitates interaction between people government organizations and businesses sometimes benefiting different parties in the process historically city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization roughly half of the world population now lives in cities which has had profound consequences for global sustainability present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areascreating numerous commuters traveling towards city centers for employment entertainment and edification however in a world of intensifying globalization all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions the most populated city proper is chongqing while the most populous metropolitan areas are the greater tokyo area the shanghai area and jabodetabek jakarta the cities of faiyum damascus and varanasi are among those laying claim to longest continual inhabitation meaning a city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively great size but also by its functions and its special symbolic status which may be conferred by a central authority the term can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of the city or to the collection of people who dwell there and can be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural territory a variety of definitions invoking population population density number of dwellings economic function and infrastructure are used in national censuses to classify populations as urban common population definitions for a city range between 1500 and 50000 people with most us states using a minimum between 1500 and 5000 inhabitants however some jurisdictions set no such minimums in the united kingdom city status is awarded by the government and then remains permanently resulting in some very small cities such as wells and st davids according to the functional definition a city is not distinguished by size alone but also by the role it plays within a larger political context cities serve as administrative commercial religious and cultural hubs for their larger surrounding areas examples of settlements called city which may not meet any of the traditional criteria to be named such include broad top city pennsylvania pop 452 and city dulas anglesey a hamlet the presence of a literate elite is sometimes included in the definition a typical city has professional administrators regulations and some form of taxation food and other necessities or means to trade for them to feed the government workers this arrangement contrasts with the more typically horizontal relationships in a tribe or village accomplishing common goals through informal agreements between neighbors or through leadership of a chief the governments may be based on heredity religion military power work projects such as canal building food distribution land ownership agriculture commerce manufacturing finance or a combination of these societies that live in cities are often called civilizations the word city and the related civilization come via old french from the latin root civitas originally meaning citizenship or community member and eventually coming to correspond with urbs meaning city in a more physical sense the roman civitas was closely linked with the greek polisanother common root appearing in english words such as metropolis geography urban geography deals both with cities in their larger context and with their internal structure site town siting has varied through history according to natural technological economic and military contexts access to water has long been a major factor in city placement and growth and despite exceptions enabled by the advent of rail transport in the nineteenth century through the present most of the worlds urban population lives near the coast or on a river urban areas as a rule cannot produce their own food and therefore must develop some relationship with a hinterland which sustains them only in special cases such as mining towns which play a vital role in long-distance trade are cities disconnected from the countryside which feeds them thus centrality within a productive region influences siting as economic forces would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually reachable locations center the vast majority of cities have a central area containing buildings with special economic political and religious significance archaeologists refer to this area by the greek term temenos or if fortified as a citadel these spaces historically reflect and amplify the citys centrality and importance to its wider sphere of influence today cities have a city center or downtown sometimes coincident with a central business district public space cities typically have public spaces where anyone can go these include privately owned spaces open to the public as well as forms of public land such as public domain and the commons western philosophy since the time of the greek agora has considered physical public space as the substrate of the symbolic public sphere public art adorns or disfigures public spaces parks and other natural sites within cities provide residents with relief from the hardness and regularity of typical built environments internal structure urban structure generally follows one or more basic patterns geomorphic radial concentric rectilinear and curvilinear physical environment generally constrains the form in which a city is built if located on a mountainside urban structure may rely on terraces and winding roads it may be adapted to its means of subsistence eg agriculture or fishing and it may be set up for optimal defense given the surrounding landscape beyond these geomorphic features cities can develop internal patterns due to natural growth or to city planning in a radial structure main roads converge on a central point this form could evolve from successive growth over a long time with concentric traces of town walls and citadels marking older city boundaries in more recent history such forms were supplemented by ring roads moving traffic around the outskirts of a town dutch cities such as amsterdam and haarlem are structured as a central square surrounded by concentric canals marking every expansion in cities such as and also moscow this pattern is still clearly visible a system of rectilinear city streets and land plots known as the grid plan has been used for millennia in asia europe and the americas the indus valley civilisation built mohenjo-daro harappa and other cities on a grid pattern using ancient principles described by kautilya and aligned with the compass points the ancient greek city of priene exemplifies a grid plan with specialized districts used across the hellenistic mediterranean urban areas urban-type settlement extends far beyond the traditional boundaries of the city proper in a form of development sometimes described critically as urban sprawl decentralization and dispersal of city functions commercial industrial residential cultural political has transformed the very meaning of the term and has challenged geographers seeking to classify territories according to an urban-rural binary metropolitan areas include suburbs and exurbs organized around the needs of commuters and sometimes edge cities characterized by a degree of economic and political independence in the us these are grouped into metropolitan statistical areas for purposes of demography and marketing some cities are now part of a continuous urban landscape called urban agglomeration conurbation or megalopolis exemplified by the boswash corridor of the northeastern united states history cities characterized by population density symbolic function and urban planning have existed for thousands of years in the conventional view civilization and the city both followed from the development of agriculture which enabled production of surplus food and thus a social division of labour with concomitant social stratification and trade early cities often featured granaries sometimes within a temple a minority viewpoint considers that cities may have arisen without agriculture due to alternative means of subsistence fishing to use as communal seasonal shelters to their value as bases for defensive and offensive military organization or to their inherent economic function cities played a crucial role in the establishment of political power over an area and ancient leaders such as alexander the great founded and created them with zeal ancient times jericho and atalhyk dated to the eighth millennium bc are among the earliest proto-cities known to archaeologists in the fourth and third millennium bc complex civilizations flourished in the river valleys of mesopotamia india china and egypt excavations in these areas have found the ruins of cities geared variously towards trade politics or religion some had large dense populations but others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations among the early old world cities mohenjo-daro of the indus valley civilization in present-day pakistan existing from about 2600 bc was one of the largest with a population of 50000 or more and a sophisticated sanitation system chinas planned cities were constructed according to sacred principles to act as celestial microcosms the ancient egyptian cities known physically by archaeologists are not extensive they include known by their arab names el lahun a workers town associated with the pyramid of senusret ii and the religious city amarna built by akhenaten and abandoned these sites appear planned in a highly regimented and stratified fashion with a minimalistic grid of rooms for the workers and increasingly more elaborate housing available for higher classes in mesopotamia the civilization of sumer followed by assyria and babylon gave rise to numerous cities governed by kings and fostering multiple languages written in cuneiform the phoenician trading empire flourishing around the turn of the first millennium bc encompassed numerous cities extending from tyre cydon and byblos to carthage and cdiz in the following centuries independent city-states of greece developed the polis an association of male landowning citizens who collectively constituted the city the agora meaning gathering place or assembly was the center of athletic artistic spiritual and political life of the polis romes rise to power brought its population to one million under the authority of its empire rome transformed and founded many cities coloniae and with them brought its principles of urban architecture design and society in the ancient americas early urban traditions developed in the andes and mesoamerica in the andes the first urban centers developed in the norte chico civilization chavin and moche cultures followed by major cities in the huari chimu and inca cultures the norte chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the norte chico region of north-central coastal peru it is the oldest known civilization in the americas flourishing between the 30th century bc and the 18th century bc mesoamerica saw the rise of early urbanism in several cultural regions beginning with the olmec and spreading to the preclassic maya the zapotec of oaxaca and teotihuacan in central mexico later cultures such as the aztec drew on these earlier urban traditions jenn-jeno located in present-day mali and dating to the third century bc lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social classbut nevertheless had specialized production and relations with a hinterland pre-arabic trade contacts probably existed between jenn-jeno and north africa other early urban centers in sub-saharan africa dated to around 500 ad include awdaghust kumbi-saleh the ancient capital of ghana and maranda a center located on a trade route between egypt and gao in the first millennium ad angkor in the khmer empire grew into one of the most extensive cities in the world and may have supported up to one million people middle ages in the remnants of the roman empire cities of late antiquity gained independence but soon lost population and importance the locus of power in the west shifted to constantinople and to the ascendant islamic civilization with its major cities baghdad cairo and crdoba from the 9th through the end of the 12th century constantinople capital of the byzantine empire was the largest and wealthiest city in europe with a population approaching 1 million the ottoman empire gradually gained control over many cities in the mediterranean area including constantinople in 1453 in the holy roman empire beginning in the 12th century free imperial cities such as nuremberg strasbourg frankfurt zurich nijmegen became a privileged elite among towns having won self-governance from their local lay or secular lord or having been granted self-governanace by the emperor and being placed under his immediate protection by 1480 these cities as far as still part of the empire became part of the imperial estates governing the empire with the emperor through the imperial diet by the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries some cities become powerful states taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires in italy medieval communes developed into city-states including the republic of venice and the republic of genoa in northern europe cities including lbeck and bruges formed the hanseatic league for collective defense and commerce their power was later challenged and eclipsed by the dutch commercial cities of ghent ypres and amsterdam similar phenomena existed elsewhere as in the case of sakai which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval japan early modern in the west nation-states became the dominant unit of political organization following the peace of westphalia in the seventeenth century western europes larger capitals london and paris benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an atlantic trade however most towns remained small during the spanish colonization of the americas the old roman city concept was extensively used cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories and were bound to several laws regarding administration finances and urbanism industrial age the growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities first in europe and then in other regions as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas england led the way as london became the capital of a world empire and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for manufacturing in the united states from 1860 to 1910 the introduction of railroads reduced transportation costs and large manufacturing centers began to emerge fueling migration from rural to city areas industrialized cities became deadly places to live due to health problems resulting from overcrowding occupational hazards of industry contaminated water and air poor sanitation and communicable diseases such as typhoid and cholera factories and slums emerged as regular features of the urban landscape post-industrial age in the second half of the twentieth century deindustrialization or economic restructuring in the west led to poverty homelessness and urban decay in formerly prosperous cities americas steel belt became a rust belt and cities such as detroit michigan and gary indiana began to shrink contrary to the global trend of massive urban expansion such cities have shifted with varying success into the service economy and public-private partnerships with concomitant gentrification uneven revitalization efforts and selective cultural development under the great leap forward and subsequent five-year plans continuing today the peoples republic of china has undergone concomitant urbanization and industrialization and to become the worlds leading manufacturer amidst these economic changes high technology and instantaneous telecommunication enable select cities to become centers of the knowledge economy a new smart city paradigm supported by institutions such as the rand corporation and ibm is bringing computerized surveillance data analysis and governance to bear on cities and city-dwellers some companies are building brand new masterplanned cities from scratch on greenfield sites urbanization urbanization is the process of migration from rural into urban areas driven by various political economic and cultural factors until the 18th century an equilibrium existed between the rural agricultural population and towns featuring markets and small-scale manufacturing with the agricultural and industrial revolutions urban population began its unprecedented growth both through migration and through demographic expansion in england the proportion of the population living in cities jumped from 17 in 1801 to 72 in 1891 in 1900 15 of the world population lived in cities the cultural appeal of cities also plays a role in attracting residents urbanization rapidly spread across the europe and the americas and since the 1950s has taken hold in asia and africa as well the population division of the united nations department of economic and social affairs reported in 2014 that for the first time more than half of the world population lives in cities latin america is the most urban continent with four fifths of its population living in cities including one fifth of the population said to live in shantytowns favelas poblaciones callampas etc batam indonesia mogadishu somalia xiamen china and niamey niger are considered among the worlds fastest-growing cities with annual growth rates of 58 in general the more developed countries of the global north remain more urbanized than the less developed countries of the global southbut the difference continues to shrink because urbanization is happening faster in the latter group asia is home to by far the greatest absolute number of city-dwellers over two billion and counting the un predicts an additional 25 billion citydwellers and 300 million fewer countrydwellers worldwide by 2050 with 90 of urban population expansion occurring in asia and africa megacities cities with population in the multi-millions have proliferated into the dozens arising especially in asia africa and latin america economic globalization fuels the growth of these cities as new torrents of foreign capital arrange for rapid industrialization as well as relocation of major businesses from europe and north america attracting immigrants from near and far a deep gulf divides rich and poor in these cities with usually contain a super-wealthy elite living in gated communities and large masses of people living in substandard housing with inadequate infrastructure and otherwise poor conditions cities around the world have expanded physically as they grow in population with increases in their surface extent with the creation of high-rise buildings for residential and commercial use and with development underground urbanization can create rapid demand for water resources management as formerly good sources of freshwater become overused and polluted and the volume of sewage begins to exceed manageable levels government local government of cities takes different forms including prominently the municipality especially in england in the united states in india and in other british colonies legally the municipal corporation municipio in spain and in portugal and along with municipalidad in most former parts of the spanish and portuguese empires and the commune in france and in chile or comune in italy the chief official of the city has the title of mayor whatever their true degree of political authority the mayor typically acts as the figurehead or personification of their city city governments have authority to make laws governing activity within cities while its jurisdiction is generally considered subordinate in ascending order to stateprovincial national and perhaps international law this hierarchy of law is not enforced rigidly in practicefor example in conflicts between municipal regulations and national principles such as constitutional rights and property rights legal conflicts and issues arise more frequently in cities than elsewhere due to the bare fact of their greater density modern city governments thoroughly regulate everyday life in many dimensions including public and personal health transport burial resource use and extraction recreation and the nature and use of buildings technologies techniques and laws governing these areasdeveloped in citieshave become ubiquitous in many areas municipal officials may be appointed from a higher level of government or elected locally municipal services cities typically provide municipal services such as education through school systems policing through police departments and firefighting through fire departments as well as the citys basic infrastructure these are provided more or less routinely in a more or less equal fashion responsibility for administration usually falls on the city government though some services may be operated by a higher level of government while others may be privately run armies may assume responsibility for policing cities in states of domestic turmoil such as americas king assassination riots of 1968 finance the traditional basis for municipal finance is local property tax levied on real estate within the city local government can also collect revenue for services or by leasing land that it owns however financing municipal services as well as urban renewal and other development projects is a perennial problem which cities address through appeals to higher governments arrangements with the private sector and techniques such as privatization selling services into the private sector corporatization formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations and financialization packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives this situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore beyond the reach of taxation cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the municipal bond essentially a loan with interest and a repayment date city governments have also begun to use tax increment financing in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield under these circumstances creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings governance governance includes government but refers to a wider domain of social control functions implemented by many actors including nongovernmental organizations the impact of globalization and the role of multinational corporations in local governments worldwide has led to a shift in perspective on urban governance away from the urban regime theory in which a coalition of local interests functionally govern toward a theory of outside economic control widely associated in academics with the philosophy of neoliberalism in the neoliberal model of governance public utilities are privatized industry is deregulated and corporations gain the status of governing actorsas indicated by the power they wield in public-private partnerships and over business improvement districts and in the expectation of self-regulation through corporate social responsibility the biggest investors and real estate developers act as the citys de facto urban planners the related concept of good governance places more emphasis on the state with the purpose of assessing urban governments for their suitability for development assistance the concepts of governance and good governance are especially invoked in the emergent megacities where international organizations consider existing governments inadequate for their large populations urban planning urban planning the application of forethought to city design involves optimizing land use transportation utilities and other basic systems in order to achieve certain objectives urban planners and scholars have proposed overlapping theories as ideals for how plans should be formed planning tools beyond the original design of the city itself include public capital investment in infrastructure and land-use controls such as zoning the continuous process of comprehensive planning involves identifying general objectives as well as collecting data to evaluate progress and inform future decisions government as the ultimate wielder of force is legally the final authority on planning but in practice the process involves both public and private elements the legal principle of eminent domain is used by government to divest citizens of their property in cases where its use is required for a project planning often involves tradeoffsdecisions in which some stand to gain and some to loseand thus is closely connected to the prevailing political situation the history of urban planning dates to some of the earliest known cities especially in the indus valley and mesoamerican civilizations which built their cities on grids and apparently zoned different areas for different purposes the effects of planning ubiquitous in todays world can be seen most clearly in the layout of planned communities fully designed prior to construction often with consideration for interlocking physical economic and cultural systems society social structure urban society is typically stratified spatially cities are formally or informally segregated along ethnic economic and racial lines people living relatively close together may live work and play in separate areas and associate with different people forming ethnic or lifestyle enclaves or in areas of concentrated poverty ghettoes while in the us and elsewhere poverty became associated with the inner city in france it has become associated with the banlieues areas of urban development which surround the city proper meanwhile across europe and north america the racially white majority is empirically the most segregated group suburbs in the west and increasingly gated communities and other forms of privatopia around the world allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive neighborhoods landless urban workers contrasted with peasants and known as the proletariat form a growing stratum of society in the age of urbanization in marxist doctrine the proletariat will inevitably revolt against the bourgeoisie as their ranks swell with disenfranchised and disaffected people lacking all stake in the status quo the global urban proletariat of today however generally lacks the status as factory workers which in the nineteenth century provided access to the means of production economics historically cities rely on rural areas for intensive farming to yield surplus crops in exchange for which they provide money political administration manufactured goods and culture urban economics tends to analyze larger agglomerations stretching beyond city limits in order to reach a more complete understanding of the local labor market as hubs of trade cities have long been home to retail commerce and consumption through the interface of shopping in the 20th century department stores using new techniques of advertising public relations decoration and design transformed urban shopping areas into fantasy worlds encouraging self-expression and escape through consumerism in general the density of cities expedites commerce and facilitates knowledge spillovers helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas a thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals population density enables also sharing of common infrastructure and production facilities however in very dense cities increased crowding and waiting times may lead to some negative effects although manufacturing fueled the growth of cities many now rely on a tertiary or service economy the services in question range from tourism hospitality entertainment housekeeping and prostitution to grey-collar work in law finance and administration culture and communications cities are typically hubs for education and the arts supporting universities museums temples and other cultural institutions they feature impressive displays of architecture ranging from small to enormous and ornate to brutal skyscrapers providing thousands of offices or homes within a small footprint and visible from miles away have become iconic urban features cultural elites tend to live in cities bound together by shared cultural capital and themselves playing some role in governance by virtue of their status as centers of culture and literacy cities can be described as the locus of civilization world history and social change density makes for effective mass communication and transmission of news through heralds printed proclamations newspapers and digital media these communication networks though still using cities as hubs penetrate extensively into all populated areas in the age of rapid communication and transportation commentators have described urban culture as nearly ubiquitous or as no longer meaningful today a citys promotion of its cultural activities dovetails with place branding and city marketing public diplomacy techniques used to inform development strategy to attract businesses investors residents and tourists and to create a shared identity and sense of place within the metropolitan area physical inscriptions plaques and monuments on display physically transmit a historical context for urban places some cities such as jerusalem mecca and rome have indelible religious status and for hundreds of years have attracted pilgrims patriotic tourists visit agra to see the taj mahal or new york city to visit the world trade center elvis lovers visit memphis to pay their respects at graceland place brands which include place satisfaction and place loyalty have great economic value comparable to the value of commodity brands because of their influence on the decision-making process of people thinking about doing business inpurchasing the brand ofa city bread and circuses among other forms of cultural appeal attract and entertain the masses sports also play a major role in city branding and local identity formation cities go to considerable lengths in competing to host the olympic games which bring global attention and tourism warfare cities play a crucial strategic role in warfare due to their economic demographic symbolic and political centrality for the same reasons they are targets in asymmetric warfare many cities throughout history were founded under military auspices a great many have incorporated fortifications and military principles continue to influence urban design indeed war may have served as the social rationale and economic basis for the very earliest cities powers engaged in geopolitical conflict have established fortified settlements as part of military strategies as in the case of garrison towns americas strategic hamlet program during the vietnam war and israeli settlements in palestine while occupying the philippines the us army ordered local people concentrated into cities and towns in order to isolate committed insurgents and battle freely against them in the countryside during world war ii national governments on occasion declared certain cities open effectively surrendering them to an advancing enemy in order to avoid damage and bloodshed urban warfare proved decisive however in the battle of stalingrad where soviet forces repulsed german occupiers with extreme casualties and destruction in an era of low-intensity conflict and rapid urbanization cities have become sites of long-term conflict waged both by foreign occupiers and by local governments against insurgency such warfare known as counterinsurgency involves techniques of surveillance and psychological warfare as well as close combat functionally extends modern urban crime prevention which already uses concepts such as defensible space although capture is the more common objective warfare has in some cases spelt complete destruction for a city mesopotamian tablets and ruins attest to such destruction as does the latin motto carthago delenda est since the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and throughout the cold war nuclear strategists continued to contemplate the use of countervalue targeting crippling an enemy by annihilating its valuable cities rather than aiming primarily at its military forces infrastructure urban infrastructure involves various physical networks and spaces necessary for transportation water use energy recreation and public functions infrastructure carries a high initial cost in fixed capital pipes wires plants vehicles etc but lower marginal costs and thus positive economies of scale because of the higher barriers to entry these networks have been classified as natural monopolies meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization public or private infrastructure in general if not every infrastructure project plays a vital role in a citys capacity for economic activity and expansion underpinning the very survival of the citys inhabitants as well as technological commercial industrial and social activities structurally many infrastructure systems take the form of networks with redundant links and multiple pathways so that the system as a whole continue to operate even if parts of it fail the particulars of a citys infrastructure systems have historical path dependence because new development must build from what exists already megaprojects such as the construction of airports power plants and railways require large upfront investments and thus tend to require funding from national government or the private sector privatization may also extend to all levels of infrastructure construction and maintenance urban infrastructure ideally serves all residents equally but in practice may prove unevenwith in some cities clear first-class and second-class alternatives utilities public utilities literally useful things with general availability include basic and essential infrastructure networks chiefly concerned with the supply of water electricity and telecommunications capability to the populace sanitation necessary for good health in crowded conditions requires water supply and waste management as well as individual hygiene urban water systems include principally a water supply network and a network for wastewater including sewage and stormwater historically either local governments or private companies have administered urban water supply with a tendency toward government water supply in the 20th century and a tendency toward private operation at the turn of the twenty-first the market for private water services is dominated by two french companies veolia water formerly vivendi and engie formerly suez said to hold 70 of all water contracts worldwide modern urban life relies heavily on the energy transmitted through electricity for the operation of electric machines from household appliances to industrial machines to now-ubiquitous electronic systems used in communications business and government and for traffic lights streetlights and indoor lighting cities rely to a lesser extent on hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and natural gas for transportation heating and cooking telecommunications infrastructure such as telephone lines and coaxial cables also traverse cities forming dense networks for mass and point-to-point communications transportation because cities rely on specialization and an economic system based on wage labour their inhabitants must have the ability to regularly travel between home work commerce and entertainment citydwellers travel foot or by wheel on roads and walkways or use special rapid transit systems based on underground overground and elevated rail cities also rely on long-distance transportation truck rail and airplane for economic connections with other cities and rural areas historically city streets were the domain of horses and their riders and pedestrians who only sometimes had sidewalks and special walking areas reserved for them in the west bicycles or velocipedes efficient human-powered machines for short- and medium-distance travel enjoyed a period of popularity at the beginning of the twentieth century before the rise of automobiles soon after they gained a more lasting foothold in asian and african cities under european influence in western cities industrializing expanding and electrifying at this time public transit systems and especially streetcars enabled urban expansion as new residential neighborhoods sprung up along transit lines and workers rode to and from work downtown since the mid-twentieth century cities have relied heavily on motor vehicle transportation with major implications for their layout environment and aesthetics this transformation occurred most dramatically in the uswhere corporate and governmental policies favored automobile transport systemsand to a lesser extent in europe the rise of personal cars accompanied the expansion of urban economic areas into much larger metropolises subsequently creating ubiquitous traffic issues with accompanying construction of new highways wider streets and alternative walkways for pedestrians however severe traffic jams still occur regularly in cities around the world as private car ownership and urbanization continue to increase overwhelming existing urban street networks the urban bus system the worlds most common form of public transport uses a network of scheduled routes to move people through the city alongside cars on the roads economic function itself also became more decentralized as concentration became impractical and employers relocated to more car-friendly locations including edge cities some cities have introduced bus rapid transit systems which include exclusive bus lanes and other methods for prioritizing bus traffic over private cars many big american cities still operate conventional public transit by rail as exemplified by the ever-popular new york city subway system rapid transit is widely used in europe and has increased in latin america and asia walking and cycling non-motorized transport enjoy increasing favor more pedestrian zones and bike lanes in american and asian urban transportation planning under the influence of such trends as the healthy cities movement the drive for sustainable development and the idea of a carfree city techniques such as road space rationing and road use charges have been introduced to limit urban car traffic housing housing of residents presents one of the major challenges every city must face adequate housing entails not only physical shelters but also the physical systems necessary to sustain life and economic activity home ownership represents status and a modicum of economic security compared to renting which may consume much of the income of low-wage urban workers homelessness or lack of housing is a challenged currently faced by millions of people in countries rich and poor ecology urban ecosystems influenced as they are by the density of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings anthropogenic buildings and waste as well as cultivation in gardens create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity they provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for immigrant plants bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other they introduce frequent disturbances construction walking to plant and animal habitats creating opportunities for recolonization and thus favoring young ecosystems with r-selected species dominant on the whole urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others due to the diminished absolute amount of biological interactions typical urban fauna include insects especially ants rodents mice rats and birds as well as cats and dogs domesticated and feral large predators are scarce cities generate considerable ecological footprints locally and at longer distances due to concentrated populations and technological activities from one perspective cities are not ecologically sustainable due to their resource needs from another proper management may be able to ameliorate a citys ill effects air pollution arises from various forms of combustion including fireplaces wood or coal-burning stoves other heating systems and internal combustion engines industrialized cities and today third-world megacities are notorious for veils of smog industrial haze which envelop them posing a chronic threat to the health of their millions of inhabitants urban soil contains higher concentrations of heavy metals especially lead copper and nickel and has lower ph than soil in comparable wilderness modern cities are known for creating their own microclimates due to concrete asphalt and other artificial surfaces which heat up in sunlight and channel rainwater into underground ducts the temperature in new york city exceeds nearby rural temperatures by an average of 23c and at times 510c differences have been recorded this effect varies nonlinearly with population changes independently of the citys physical size aerial particulates increase rainfall by 510 thus urban areas experience unique climates with earlier flowering and later leaf dropping than in nearby country poor and working-class people face disproportionate exposure to environmental risks known as environmental racism when intersecting also with racial segregation for example within the urban microclimate less-vegetated poor neighborhoods bear more of the heat but have fewer means of coping with it world city system as the world becomes more closely linked through economics politics technology and culture a process called globalization cities have come to play a leading role in transnational affairs exceeding the limitations of international relations conducted by national governments this phenomenon resurgent today can be traced back to the silk road phoenicia and the greek city-states through the hanseatic league and other alliances of cities today the information economy based on high-speed internet infrastructure enables instantaneous telecommunication around the world effectively eliminating the distance between cities for the purposes of stock markets and other high-level elements of the world economy as well as personal communications and mass media global city a global city also known as a world city is a prominent centre of trade banking finance innovation and markets saskia sassen used the term global city in her 1991 work the global city new york london tokyo to refer to a citys power status and cosmopolitanism rather than to its size following this view of cities it is possible to rank the worlds cities hierarchically global cities form the capstone of the global hierarchy exerting command and control through their economic and political influence global cities may have reached their status due to early transition to post-industrialism or through inertia which has enabled them to maintain their dominance from the industrial era this type of ranking exemplifies an emerging discourse in which cities considered variations on the same ideal type must compete with each other globally to achieve prosperity critics of the notion point to the different realms of power and interchange the term global city is heavily influenced by economic factors and thus may not account for places that are otherwise significant paul james for example argues that the term is reductive and skewed in its focus on financial systems multinational corporations and banks make their headquarters in global cities and conduct much of their business within this context american firms dominate the international markets for law and engineering and maintain branches in the biggest foreign global cities global cities feature concentrations of extremely wealthy and extremely poor people their economies are lubricated by their capacity limited by the national governments immigration policy which functionally defines the supply side of the labor market to recruit low- and high-skilled immigrant workers from poorer areas more and more cities today draw on this globally available labor force riverside church time warner center 220 central park south central park tower

and the promotion of multi-level governance within the european union as a technique for european integration cities including hamburg prague amsterdam the hague and city of london maintain their own
