titan is the largest moon of saturn it is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere and the only object in space other than earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid have been found titan is the sixth gravitationally rounded moon from saturn frequently described as a planet-like moon titan is 50 larger than earths moon and 80 more massive it is the second-largest moon in the solar system after jupiters moon ganymede and is larger than the smallest planet mercury but only 40 as massive discovered in 1655 by the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens titan was the first known moon of saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite after earths moon and the four galilean moons of jupiter titan orbits saturn at 20 saturn radii from titans surface saturn subtends an arc of 509 degrees and would appear 114 times larger in the sky than the moon from earth titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material much as with venus before the space age the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of titans surface until the cassinihuygens mission in 2004 provided new information including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in titans polar regions the geologically young surface is generally smooth with few impact craters although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found the atmosphere of titan is largely nitrogen minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog the climateincluding wind and raincreates surface features similar to those of earth such as dunes rivers lakes seas probably of liquid methane and ethane and deltas and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on earth with its liquids both surface and subsurface and robust nitrogen atmosphere titans methane cycle is analogous to earths water cycle at the much lower temperature of about 94k 1792c 2905f history discovery titan was discovered on march 25 1655 by the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens huygens was inspired by galileos discovery of jupiters four largest moons in 1610 and his improvements in telescope technology christiaan with the help of his older brother constantijn huygens jr began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting saturn with one of the telescopes they built it was the sixth moon ever discovered after earths moon and the galilean moons of jupiter naming huygens named his discovery saturni luna or luna saturni latin for saturns moon publishing in the 1655 tract de saturni luna observatio nova a new observation of saturns moon after giovanni domenico cassini published his discoveries of four more moons of saturn between 1673 and 1686 astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and titan as saturn i through v with titan then in fourth position other early epithets for titan include saturns ordinary satellite titan is officially numbered saturn vi because after the 1789 discoveries the numbering scheme was frozen to avoid causing any more confusion titan having borne the numbers ii and iv as well as vi numerous small moons have been discovered closer to saturn since then the name titan and the names of all seven satellites of saturn then known came from john herschel son of william herschel discoverer of two other saturnian moons mimas and enceladus in his 1847 publication results of astronomical observations made during the years 1834 5 6 7 8 at the cape of good hope he suggested the names of the mythological titans ancient greek brothers and sisters of cronus the greek saturn in greek mythology the titans were a race of powerful deities descendants of gaia and uranus that ruled during the legendary golden age orbit and rotation titan orbits saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours like the moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets its rotational period its day is identical to its orbital period titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with saturn and permanently shows one face to the planet so titans day is equal to its orbit period because of this there is a sub-saturnian point on its surface from which the planet would always appear to hang directly overhead longitudes on titan are measured westward starting from the meridian passing through this point its orbital eccentricity is 00288 and the orbital plane is inclined 0348 degrees relative to the saturnian equator viewed from earth titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 saturn radii just over 1200000 kilometers 750000mi from saturn and subtends a disk 08 arcseconds in diameter the small irregularly shaped satellite hyperion is locked in a 34 orbital resonance with titan a slow and smooth evolution of the resonancein which hyperion migrated from a chaotic orbitis considered unlikely based on models hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island whereas the massive titan absorbed or ejected bodies that made close approaches bulk characteristics titan is 514946 kilometers 319973mi in diameter 106 times that of the planet mercury 148 that of the moon and 040 that of earth before the arrival of voyager 1 in 1980 titan was thought to be slightly larger than ganymede diameter 5262 kilometers 3270mi and thus the largest moon in the solar system this was an overestimation caused by titans dense opaque atmosphere which extends many kilometres above its surface and increases its apparent diameter titans diameter and mass and thus its density are similar to those of the jovian moons ganymede and callisto based on its bulk density of 188gcm titans composition is half water ice and half rocky material though similar in composition to dione and enceladus it is denser due to gravitational compression it has a mass 14226 that of saturn making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary it is second in terms of relative diameter of moons to a gas giant titan being 122609 of saturns diameter triton is larger in diameter relative to neptune at 118092 titan is likely differentiated into several layers with a 3400-kilometer 2100mi rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice its interior may still be hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a magma composed of water and ammonia between the ice ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice the presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as 176k 97c for eutectic mixture with water the cassini probe discovered the evidence for the layered structure in the form of natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in titans atmosphere titans surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves so they may instead be reflecting off the liquidice boundary of a subsurface ocean surface features were observed by the cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 kilometers 19mi between october 2005 and may 2007 which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as titan orbits saturn comparison of the gravity field with the radar-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid formation the moons of jupiter and saturn are thought to have formed through co-accretion a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the solar system as the young gas giants formed they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons whereas jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular planet-like orbits titan overwhelmingly dominates saturns system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone a proposed model for the formation of titan is that saturns system began with a group of moons similar to jupiters galilean satellites but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts which would go on to form titan saturns mid-sized moons such as iapetus and rhea were formed from the debris of these collisions such a violent beginning would also explain titans orbital eccentricity a 2014 analysis of titans atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it has possibly been sourced from material similar to that found in the oort cloud and not from sources present during co-accretion of materials around saturn atmosphere titan is the only known moon with a significant atmosphere and its atmosphere is the only nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere in the solar system aside from earths observations of it made in 2004 by cassini suggest that titan is a super rotator like venus with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface observations from the voyager space probes have shown that titans atmosphere is denser than earths with a surface pressure about 145 atm it is also about 119 times as massive as earths overall or about 73 times more massive on a per surface area basis opaque haze layers block most visible light from the sun and other sources and obscures titans surface features titans lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than earths the atmosphere of titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit it was not until the arrival of the cassinihuygens spacecraft in 2004 that the first direct images of titans surface were obtained titans atmospheric composition is nitrogen 97 methane 2701 hydrogen 0102 with trace amounts of other gases there are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons such as ethane diacetylene methylacetylene acetylene and propane and of other gases such as cyanoacetylene hydrogen cyanide carbon dioxide carbon monoxide cyanogen argon and helium the hydrocarbons are thought to form in titans upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the suns ultraviolet light producing a thick orange smog titan spends 95 of its time within saturns magnetosphere which may help shield it from the solar wind energy from the sun should have converted all traces of methane in titans atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million yearsa short time compared to the age of the solar system this suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within titan itself the ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes on april 3 2013 nasa reported that complex organic chemicals collectively called tholins likely arise on titan based on studies simulating the atmosphere of titan on june 6 2013 scientists at the iaa-csic reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of titan on september 30 2013 propene was detected in the atmosphere of titan by nasas cassini spacecraft using its composite infrared spectrometer cirs this is the first time propene has been found on any moon or planet other than earth and is the first chemical found by the cirs the detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to nasas voyager 1 spacecrafts first close planetary flyby of titan in 1980 during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up titans brown haze were hydrocarbons theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the suns ultraviolet photolysis of methane on october 24 2014 methane was found in polar clouds on titan climate titans surface temperature is about 94k 1792c at this temperature water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere titan receives about 1 as much sunlight as earth before sunlight reaches the surface about 90 has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere leaving only 01 of the amount of light earth receives atmospheric methane creates a greenhouse effect on titans surface without which titan would be far colder conversely haze in titans atmosphere contributes to an anti-greenhouse effect by reflecting sunlight back into space cancelling a portion of the greenhouse effect and making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere titans clouds probably composed of methane ethane or other simple organics are scattered and variable punctuating the overall haze the findings of the huygens probe indicate that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto its surface clouds typically cover 1 of titans disk though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8 one hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere resulting in convection this explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size it was summer in titans southern hemisphere until 2010 when saturns orbit which governs titans motion moved titans northern hemisphere into the sunlight when the seasons switch it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole surface features global map of titan with iau labels august 2016 global map of titan with iau labels august 2016 titan infrared views 2004 2017 titan infrared views 2004 2017 titans north pole 2014 titans north pole 2014 titans south pole 2014 titans south pole 2014 the surface of titan has been described as complex fluid-processed and geologically young titan has been around since the solar systems formation but its surface is much younger between 100 million and 1 billion years old geological processes may have reshaped titans surface titans atmosphere is twice as thick as earths making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the visible light spectrum the cassini spacecraft used infrared instruments radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar sar imaging to map portions of titan during its close fly-bys the first images revealed a diverse geology with both rough and smooth areas there are features that may be volcanic in origin disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface there is also evidence that titans ice shell may be substantially rigid which would suggest little geologic activity there are also streaky features some of them hundreds of kilometers in length that appear to be caused by windblown particles examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes radar altimetry suggests height variation is low typically no more than 150meters occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height titans surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain these include xanadu a large reflective equatorial area about the size of australia it was first identified in infrared images from the hubble space telescope in 1994 and later viewed by the cassini spacecraft the convoluted region is filled with hills and cut by valleys and chasms it is criss-crossed in places by dark lineamentssinuous topographical features resembling ridges or crevices these may represent tectonic activity which would indicate that xanadu is geologically young alternatively the lineaments may be liquid-formed channels suggesting old terrain that has been cut through by stream systems there are dark areas of similar size elsewhere on titan observed from the ground and by cassini at least one of these ligeia mare titans second-largest sea is almost a pure methane sea lakes the possibility of hydrocarbon seas on titan was first suggested based on voyager 1 and 2 data that showed titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them but direct evidence was not obtained until 1995 when data from hubble and other observations suggested the existence of liquid methane on titan either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite-wide oceans similar to water on earth the cassini mission confirmed the former hypothesis when the probe arrived in the saturnian system in 2004 it was hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans would be detected from the sunlight reflected off their surface but no specular reflections were initially observed near titans south pole an enigmatic dark feature named ontario lacus was identified and later confirmed to be a lake a possible shoreline was also identified near the pole via radar imagery following a flyby on july 22 2006 in which the cassini spacecrafts radar imaged the northern latitudes that were then in winter several large smooth and thus dark to radar patches were seen dotting the surface near the pole based on the observations scientists announced definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on saturns moon titan in january 2007 the cassinihuygens team concluded that the imaged features are almost certainly the long-sought hydrocarbon lakes the first stable bodies of surface liquid found outside earth some appear to have channels associated with liquid and lie in topographical depressions the liquid erosion features appear to be a very recent occurrence channels in some regions have created surprisingly little erosion suggesting erosion on titan is extremely slow or some other recent phenomena may have wiped out older riverbeds and landforms overall the cassini radar observations have shown that lakes cover only a small percentage of the surface making titan much drier than earth most of the lakes are concentrated near the poles where the relative lack of sunlight prevents evaporation but several long-standing hydrocarbon lakes in the equatorial desert regions have also been discovered including one near the huygens landing site in the shangri-la region which is about half the size of the great salt lake in utah usa the equatorial lakes are probably oases ie the likely supplier is underground aquifers in june 2008 the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer on cassini confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in ontario lacus on december 21 2008 cassini passed directly over ontario lacus and observed specular reflection in radar the strength of the reflection saturated the probes receiver indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm implying either that surface winds were minimal or the lakes hydrocarbon fluid is viscous on july 8 2009 cassinis vims observed a specular reflection indicative of a smooth mirror-like surface off what today is called jingpo lacus a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness specular reflections are indicative of a smooth mirror-like surface so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging early radar measurements made in july 2009 and january 2010 indicated that ontario lacus was extremely shallow with an average depth of 043m and a maximum depth of 3 to 7m 98 to 230ft in contrast the northern hemispheres ligeia mare was initially mapped to depths exceeding 8m the maximum discernable by the radar instrument and the analysis techniques of the time later science analysis released in 2014 more fully mapped the depths of titans three methane seas and showed depths of more than 200 meters 660ft ligeia mare averages from 20 to 40m 66 to 131ft in depth while other parts of ligeia did not register any radar reflection at all indicating a depth of more than 200m 660ft while only the second largest of titans methane seas ligeia contains enough liquid methane to fill three lake michigans in may 2013 cassinis radar altimeter observed titans vid flumina channels defined as a drainage network connected to titans second largest hydrocarbon sea ligeia mare analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep up to 570m steep-sided canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as ligeia mare to within a vertical precision of about 07m consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of ligeia mare consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system this is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on titan vid flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea but there are a few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations during six flybys of titan from 2006 to 2011 cassini gathered radiometric tracking and optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer titans changing shape the density of titan is consistent with a body that is about 60 rock and 40 water the teams analyses suggest that titans surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit that degree of warping suggests that titans interior is relatively deformable and that the most likely model of titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean the teams findings together with the results of previous studies hint that titans ocean may lie no more than 100 kilometers 62mi below its surface on july 2 2014 nasa reported the ocean inside titan may be as salty as the dead sea on september 3 2014 nasa reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground called an alkanofer to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes in 2016 cassini found the first evidence of fluid-filled channels on titan in a series of deep steep-sided canyons flowing into ligeia mare this network of canyons dubbed vid flumina range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40 they are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting like earths grand canyon or a lowering of sea level or perhaps a combination of the two the depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years impact craters radar sar and imaging data from cassini have revealed few impact craters on titans surface these impacts appear to be relatively young compared to titans age the few impact craters discovered include a 440-kilometer-wide 270mi two-ring impact basin named menrva seen by cassinis iss as a bright-dark concentric pattern a smaller 60-kilometer-wide 37mi flat-floored crater named sinlap and a 30km 19mi crater with a central peak and dark floor named ksa have also been observed radar and cassini imaging have also revealed crateriforms circular features on the surface of titan that may be impact related but lack certain features that would make identification certain for example a 90-kilometer-wide 56mi ring of bright rough material known as guabonito has been observed by cassini this feature is thought to be an impact crater filled in by dark windblown sediment several other similar features have been observed in the dark shangri-la and aaru regions radar observed several circular features that may be craters in the bright region xanadu during cassinis april 30 2006 flyby of titan many of titans craters or probable craters display evidence of extensive erosion and all show some indication of modification most large craters have breached or incomplete rims despite the fact that some craters on titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the solar system there is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation unlike on other large icy moons most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava infill from various geological processes is one reason for titans relative deficiency of craters atmospheric shielding also plays a role it is estimated that titans atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two the limited high-resolution radar coverage of titan obtained through 2007 22 suggested the existence of nonuniformities in its crater distribution xanadu has 29 times more craters than elsewhere the leading hemisphere has a 30 higher density than the trailing hemisphere there are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common pre-cassini models of impact trajectories and angles suggest that where the impactor strikes the water ice crust a small amount of ejecta remains as liquid water within the crater it may persist as liquid for centuries or longer sufficient for the synthesis of simple precursor molecules to the origin of life cryovolcanism and mountains scientists have long speculated that conditions on titan resemble those of early earth though at a much lower temperature the detection of argon-40 in the atmosphere in 2004 indicated that volcanoes had spawned plumes of lava composed of water and ammonia global maps of the lake distribution on titans surface revealed that there is not enough surface methane to account for its continued presence in its atmosphere and thus that a significant portion must be added through volcanic processes still there is a paucity of surface features that can be unambiguously interpreted as cryovolcanoes one of the first of such features revealed by cassini radar observations in 2004 called ganesa macula resembles the geographic features called pancake domes found on venus and was thus initially thought to be cryovolcanic in origin until kirk et al refuted this hypothesis at the american geophysical union annual meeting in december 2008 the feature was found to be not a dome at all but appeared to result from accidental combination of light and dark patches in 2004 cassini also detected an unusually bright feature called tortola facula which was interpreted as a cryovolcanic dome no similar features have been identified as of 2010 in december 2008 astronomers announced the discovery of two transient but unusually long-lived bright spots in titans atmosphere which appear too persistent to be explained by mere weather patterns suggesting they were the result of extended cryovolcanic episodes in march 2009 structures resembling lava flows were announced in a region of titan called hotei arcus which appears to fluctuate in brightness over several months though many phenomena were suggested to explain this fluctuation the lava flows were found to rise 200 meters 660ft above titans surface consistent with it having been erupted from beneath the surface a mountain range measuring 150 kilometers 93mi long 30 kilometers 19mi wide and 15 kilometers 093mi high was also discovered by cassini in 2006 this range lies in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be composed of icy material and covered in methane snow the movement of tectonic plates perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin could have opened a gap through which the mountains material upwelled prior to cassini scientists assumed that most of the topography on titan would be impact structures yet these findings reveal that similar to earth the mountains were formed through geological processes in december 2010 the cassini mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found named sotra patera it is one in a chain of at least three mountains each between 1000 and 1500m in height several of which are topped by large craters the ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows most of titans highest peaks occur near its equator in so-called ridge belts they are believed to be analogous to earths fold mountains such as the rockies or the himalayas formed by the collision and buckling of tectonic plates or to subduction zones like the andes where upwelling lava or cryolava from a melting descending plate rises to the surface one possible mechanism for their formation is tidal forces from saturn because titans icy mantle is less viscous than earths magma mantle and because its icy bedrock is softer than earths granite bedrock mountains are unlikely to reach heights as great as those on earth in 2016 the cassini team announced what they believe to be the tallest mountain on titan located in the mithrim montes range it is 3337 m tall if volcanism on titan really exists the hypothesis is that it is driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle as it is on earth magma on earth is made of liquid rock which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts because ice is less dense than water titans watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust this means that cryovolcanism on titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate possibly via tidal flexing from nearby saturn the low-pressure ice overlaying a liquid layer of ammonium sulfate ascends buoyantly and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events titan is resurfaced through the process by grain-sized ice and ammonium sulfate ash which helps produce a wind-shaped landscape and sand dune features in 2008 jeffrey moore planetary geologist of ames research center proposed an alternate view of titans geology noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on titan so far he asserted that titan is a geologically dead world whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering fluvial and eolian erosion mass wasting and other exogenic processes according to this hypothesis methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of titans cold and stiff interior ganesa macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center the mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior even in this case titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic waterammonia mixture with a temperature of 176k 97c which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core the bright xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of callisto indeed were it not for its lack of an atmosphere callisto could serve as a model for titans geology in this scenario jeffrey moore even called titan callisto with weather many of the more prominent mountains and hills have been given official names by the international astronomical union according to jpl by convention mountains on titan are named for mountains from middle-earth the fictional setting in fantasy novels by j r r tolkien colles collections of hills are named for characters from the same tolkien works dark equatorial terrain in the first images of titans surface taken by earth-based telescopes in the early 2000s large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling titans equator prior to the arrival of cassini these regions were thought to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons radar images captured by the cassini spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes up to 330ft 100m high about a kilometer wide and tens to hundreds of kilometers long dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction in the case of titan steady zonal eastward winds combine with variable tidal winds approximately 05 meters per second the tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from saturn on titans atmosphere which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the moon on earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator this wind pattern it was theorized causes granular material on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west-to-east the dunes break up around mountains where the wind direction shifts the longitudinal or linear dunes were initially presumed to be formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate titans surface winds blow toward the west at less than 1 meter per second they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes may be the result of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when titan is in equinox these storms produce strong downdrafts flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface the sand on titan is likely not made up of small grains of silicates like the sand on earth but rather might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the water-ice bedrock possibly in the form of flash floods alternatively the sand could also have come from organic solids called tholins produced by photochemical reactions in titans atmosphere studies of dunes composition in may 2008 revealed that they possessed less water than the rest of titan and are thus most likely derived from organic soot like hydrocarbon polymers clumping together after raining onto the surface calculations indicate the sand on titan has a density of one-third that of terrestrial sand the low density combined with the dryness of titans atmosphere might cause the grains to clump together because of static electricity buildup the stickiness might make it difficult for the generally mild breeze close to titans surface to move the dunes although more powerful winds from seasonal storms could still blow them eastward around equinox strong downburst winds can lift micron-sized solid organic particles up from the dunes to create titanian dust storms observed as intense and short-lived brightenings in the infrared observation and exploration titan is never visible to the naked eye but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of titan to saturns brilliant globe and ring system an occulting bar covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet greatly improves viewing titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of 82 and mean opposition magnitude 84 this compares to 46 for the similarly sized ganymede in the jovian system observations of titan prior to the space age were limited in 1907 spanish astronomer josep comas i sol observed limb darkening of titan the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere in 1944 gerard p kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane the first probe to visit the saturnian system was pioneer 11 in 1979 which revealed that titan was probably too cold to support life it took images of titan including titan and saturn together in mid to late 1979 the quality was soon surpassed by the two voyagers titan was examined by both voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981 respectively voyager 1s trajectory was designed to provide an optimized titan flyby during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density composition and temperature of the atmosphere and obtain a precise measurement of titans mass atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as xanadu and shangri-la which had been observed in the infrared by the hubble space telescope voyager 2 which would have been diverted to perform the titan flyby if voyager 1 had been unable to did not pass near titan and continued on to uranus and neptune cassinihuygens even with the data provided by the voyagers titan remained a body of mysterya large satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult the mystery that had surrounded titan since the 17th-century observations of christiaan huygens and giovanni cassini was revealed by a spacecraft named in their honor the cassinihuygens spacecraft reached saturn on july 1 2004 and began the process of mapping titans surface by radar a joint project of the european space agency esa and nasa cassinihuygens proved a very successful mission the cassini probe flew by titan on october 26 2004 and took the highest-resolution images ever of titans surface at only 1200 kilometers 750mi discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye on july 22 2006 cassini made its first targeted close fly-by at 950 kilometers 590mi from titan the closest flyby was at 880 kilometers 550mi on june 21 2010 liquid has been found in abundance on the surface in the north polar region in the form of many lakes and seas discovered by cassini huygens landing huygens landed on titan on january 14 2005 discovering that many of its surface features seem to have been formed by fluids at some point in the past titan is the most distant body from earth to have a space probe land on its surface the huygens probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called adiri the probe photographed pale hills with dark rivers running down to a dark plain current understanding is that the hills also referred to as highlands are composed mainly of water ice dark organic compounds created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the sun may rain from titans atmosphere they are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales after landing huygens photographed a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles which are composed of water ice the two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear the left-hand one is 15centimeters across and the one in the center is 4centimeters across at a distance of about 85centimeters from huygens there is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks indicating possible fluvial activity the surface is darker than originally expected consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice the soil visible in the images is interpreted to be precipitation from the hydrocarbon haze above in march 2007 nasa esa and cospar decided to name the huygens landing site the hubert curien memorial station in memory of the former president of the esa proposed or conceptual missions there have been several conceptual missions proposed in recent years for returning a robotic space probe to titan initial conceptual work has been completed for such missions by nasa the esa and jpl at present none of these proposals have become funded missions the titan saturn system mission tssm was a joint nasaesa proposal for exploration of saturns moons it envisions a hot-air balloon floating in titans atmosphere for six months it was competing against the europa jupiter system mission ejsm proposal for funding in february 2009 it was announced that esanasa had given the ejsm mission priority ahead of the tssm the proposed titan mare explorer time was a low-cost lander that would splash down in a lake in titans northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for three to six months it was selected for a phase-a design study in 2011 as a candidate mission for the 12th nasa discovery program opportunity but was not selected for flight another mission to titan proposed in early 2012 by jason barnes a scientist at the university of idaho is the aerial vehicle for in-situ and airborne titan reconnaissance aviatr an unmanned plane or drone that would fly through titans atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of titan nasa did not approve the requested 715 million and the future of the project is uncertain a conceptual design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the spanish-based private engineering firm sener and the centro de astrobiologa in madrid the concept probe is called titan lake in-situ sampling propelled explorer talise the major difference compared to the time probe would be that talise is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not be limited to simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down a discovery program contestant for its mission 13 is journey to enceladus and titan jet an astrobiology saturn orbiter that would assess the habitability potential of enceladus and titan in 2015 the nasa innovative advanced concepts program niac awarded a phase ii grant to a design study of a submarine to explore the seas of titan prebiotic conditions and life titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry with a possible subsurface liquid ocean serving as a biotic environment the cassinihuygens mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds it showed an environment on titan that is similar in some ways to ones theorized for the primordial earth scientists surmise that the atmosphere of early earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on titan with the important exception of a lack of water vapor on titan formation of complex molecules the millerurey experiment and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of titan and the addition of uv radiation complex molecules and polymer substances like tholins can be generated the reaction starts with dissociation of nitrogen and methane forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene further reactions have been studied extensively it has been reported that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in titans atmosphere five nucleotide bases the building blocks of dna and rna were among the many compounds produced in addition amino acids the building blocks of protein were found it was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present on april 3 2013 nasa reported that complex organic chemicals could arise on titan based on studies simulating the atmosphere of titan on june 6 2013 scientists at the iaa-csic reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah in the upper atmosphere of titan on july 26 2017 cassini scientists positively identified the presence of carbon chain anions in titans upper atmosphere which appeared to be involved in the production of large complex organics these highly reactive molecules were previously known to contribute to building complex organics in the interstellar medium therefore highlighting a possibly universal stepping stone to producing complex organic material on july 28 2017 scientists reported that acrylonitrile or vinyl cyanide c2h3cn possibly essential for life by being related to cell membrane and vesicle structure formation had been found on titan in october 2018 researchers reported low-temperature chemical pathways from simple organic compounds to complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah chemicals such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of pahs in the low-temperature atmosphere of titan and may be significant pathways in terms of the pah world hypothesis in producing precursors to biochemicals related to life as we know it possible subsurface habitats laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on earth the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable several theories suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer it has also been theorized that liquid-ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface another model suggests an ammoniawater solution as much as 200 kilometers 120mi deep beneath a water-ice crust with conditions that although extreme by terrestrial standards are such that life could survive heat transfer between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life detection of microbial life on titan would depend on its biogenic effects with the atmospheric methane and nitrogen examined methane and life at the surface it has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on titan just as organisms on earth live in water such organisms would inhale h2 in place of o2 metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide all living things on earth including methanogens use liquid water as a solvent it is speculated that life on titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon such as methane or ethane water is a stronger solvent than methane water is also more chemically reactive and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis a life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way in 2005 astrobiologist chris mckay argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of titan it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the titan troposphere levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected in 2010 darrell strobel from johns hopkins university identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of titan compared to the lower layers arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 10 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near titans surface as strobel noted his findings were in line with the effects mckay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present the same year another study showed low levels of acetylene on titans surface which were interpreted by mckay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons although restating the biological hypothesis he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes eg a surface catalyst accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen or flaws in the current models of material flow composition data and transport models need to be substantiated etc even so despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one mckay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at 95k 180c would still be significant as nasa notes in its news article on the june 2010 findings to date methane-based life forms are only hypothetical scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere as the nasa statement also says some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive exotic form of life or precursor to life on titans surface in february 2015 a hypothetical cell membrane capable of functioning in liquid methane in titan conditions was modeled composed of small molecules containing carbon hydrogen and nitrogen it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on earth which are composed of phospholipids compounds of carbon hydrogen oxygen and phosphorus this hypothetical cell membrane was termed an azotosome a combination of azote french for nitrogen and liposome obstacles despite these biological possibilities there are formidable obstacles to life on titan and any analogy to earth is inexact at a vast distance from the sun titan is frigid and its atmosphere lacks co2 at titans surface water exists only in solid form because of these difficulties scientists such as jonathan lunine have viewed titan less as a likely habitat for life than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on earth although life itself may not exist the prebiotic conditions on titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere using titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft but laboratory experiments and chemical and photochemical modeling on earth panspermia hypothesis it is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on earths surface may have caused fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape earths gravity suggesting the possibility of transpermia calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the solar system including titan on the other hand jonathan lunine has argued that any living things in titans cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other future conditions conditions on titan could become far more habitable in the far future five billion years from now as the sun becomes a red giant its surface temperature could rise enough for titan to support liquid water on its surface making it habitable as the suns ultraviolet output decreases the haze in titans upper atmosphere will be depleted lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role these conditions together could create a habitable environment and could persist for several hundred million years this is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on earth though the presence of ammonia on titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly see also solar system portal colonization of titan lakes
