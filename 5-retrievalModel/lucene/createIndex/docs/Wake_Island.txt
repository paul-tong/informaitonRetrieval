kilometers west of honolulu 1991 miles 3204 kilometers southeast of tokyo and 898 miles 1445 kilometers north of majuro the island is an unorganized unincorporated territory of the united states that is also claimed by the republic of the marshall islands wake island is one of the most isolated islands in the world and the nearest inhabited island is utirik atoll in the marshall islands 592 miles 953 kilometers to the southeast wake island one of 14 us insular areas is administered by the united states air force under an agreement with the us department of the interior the center of activity on the atoll is at wake island airfield iata awk icao pwak which is primarily used as a mid-pacific refueling stop for military aircraft and an emergency landing area the 9800-foot 3000m runway is the longest strategic runway in the pacific islands south of the runway is the wake island launch center a missile launch site of the ronald reagan ballistic missile defense test site operated by the united states army space and missile defense command and the missile defense agency the base operations support contractor at wake is chugach federal solutions inc about 94 people live on the island and access to it is restricted population fluctuates depending on operations being conducted by missile defense agency activities on december 11 1941 wake island was the site of the empire of japans first unsuccessful attack on american forces in the battle of wake island when us marines with some us navy personnel and civilians on the island repelled an attempted japanese invasion sinking two enemy destroyers and a transport the island fell to overwhelming japanese forces 12 days later in a second attack this one with extensive support from japanese carrier-based aircraft returning from the attack on pearl harbors naval and air bases in hawaii further east sixteen days previously wake island remained occupied by japanese forces until the end of the war in september 1945 the submerged and emergent lands at the atoll are a unit of the pacific remote islands marine national monument wake island together with eight other insular areas comprises the united states minor outlying islands a statistical designation defined by the international organization for standardizations iso 3166-1 code they are collectively represented by the iso 3166-1 alpha-2 code um wake island itself is represented by the iso 3166-2 code um-79 etymology wake island derives its name from british sea captain samuel wake who rediscovered the atoll in 1796 while in command of the prince william henry the name is sometimes attributed to capt william wake who also is reported to have discovered the atoll from the prince william henry in 1792 geography wake is located two-thirds of the way from honolulu to guam honolulu is 2300statute miles 3700km to the east and guam 1510statute miles 2430km to the west the closest land is the uninhabited bokak atoll 348mi 560km in the marshall islands to the southeast the atoll is to the west of the international date line and in the wake island time zone utc12 the easternmost time zone in the united states and almost one day ahead of the 50 states although wake is officially called an island in the singular form it is actually an atoll composed of three islets and a reef surrounding a central lagoon climate wake island lies in the tropical zone but is subject to periodic temperate storms during the winter sea surface temperatures are warm all year long reaching above 80f 27c in summer and autumn typhoons occasionally pass over the island typhoons on october 19 1940 an unnamed typhoon hit wake island with 120 knots 220kmh winds this was the first recorded typhoon to hit the island since observations began in 1935 super typhoon olive barreled through wake on september 16 1952 with wind speeds reaching 150 knots 280kmh olive caused major flooding destroyed approximately 85 of its structures and caused 16 million in damages on september 16 1967 at 1040 pm local time the eye of super typhoon sarah passed over the island sustained winds in the eyewall were 130 knots 240kmh from the north before the eye and from the south afterward all non-reinforced structures were demolished there were no serious injuries and the majority of the civilian population was evacuated after the storm on august 28 2006 the united states air force evacuated all 188 residents and suspended all operations as category 5 super typhoon ioke headed toward wake by august 31 the southwestern eyewall of the storm passed over the island with winds well over 185 miles per hour 298kmh driving a 20ft 6m storm surge and waves directly into the lagoon inflicting major damage a us air force assessment and repair team returned to the island in september 2006 and restored limited function to the airfield and facilities leading ultimately to a full return to normal operations history early european contact wake island was first encountered by europeans on october 2 1568 by spanish explorer and navigator lvaro de mendaa de neyra in 1567 mendaa and his crew had set off on two ships los reyes and todos los santos from callao peru on an expedition to search for a gold-rich land in the south pacific as mentioned in inca tradition after visiting tuvalu and the solomon islands the expedition headed north and came upon wake island a low barren island judged to be eight leagues in circumference since the date october 2 1568 was the eve of the feast of saint francis of assisi the captain named the island san francisco the ships were in need of water and the crew was suffering from scurvy but after circling the island it was determined that wake was waterless and had not a cocoanut nor a pandanus and in fact there was nothing on it but sea-birds and sandy places covered with bushes in 1796 captain samuel wake of the british merchant vessel prince william henry also came upon wake island naming the atoll for himself soon thereafter the 80-ton british fur trading merchant brig halcyon arrived at wake and master charles william barkley unaware of captain wakes earlier and other prior european contact named the atoll halcyon island in honor of his ship in 1823 captain edward gardner while in command of the british royal navys whaling ship hms bellona visited an island at 191500n 1663200e 1925000n 16653333e 1925000 16653333 which he judged to be 2025 miles 3240 kilometers long the island was covered with wood having a very green and rural appearance this report is considered to be another sighting of wake island united states exploring expedition on december 20 1841 the united states exploring expedition commanded by lt charles wilkes usn arrived at wake on ussvincennes and sent several boats to survey the island wilkes described the atoll as a low coral one of triangular form and eight feet above the surface it has a large lagoon in the centre which was well filled with fish of a variety of species among these were some fine mullet he also noted that wake had no fresh water but was covered with shrubs the most abundant of which was the tournefortia the expeditions naturalist titian peale noted that the only remarkable part in the formation of this island is the enormous blocks of coral which have been thrown up by the violence of the sea peale collected an egg from a short-tailed albatross and added other specimens including a polynesian rat to the natural history collections of the expedition wilkes also reported that from appearances the island must be at times submerged or the sea makes a complete breach over it the wreck and salvage of libelle wake island first received international attention with the wreck of the barque libelle on the night of march 4 1866 the 650-ton iron-hulled libelle of bremen struck the eastern reef of wake island during a gale commanded by captain anton tobias the ship was en route from san francisco to hong kong after three days of searching and digging on the island for water the crew was able to recover a 200 us gallons 760l water tank from the wrecked ship after three weeks with a dwindling water supply and no sign of rescue the passengers and crew decided to leave wake and attempt to sail to guam the center of the then spanish colony of the mariana islands on the two remaining boats from libelle the 22 passengers and some of the crew sailed in the 22-foot 7m longboat under the command of first mate rudolf kausch and the remainder of the crew sailed with captain tobias in the 20-foot 6m gig on april 8 1866 after 13 days of frequent squalls short rations and tropical sun the longboat reached guam unfortunately the gig commanded by the captain was lost at sea the spanish governor of the mariana islands francisco moscoso y lara welcomed and provided aid to the libelle shipwreck survivors on guam he also ordered the schooner ana owned and commanded by his son-in-law george h johnston to be dispatched with first mate kausch to search for the missing gig and then sail on to wake island to confirm the shipwreck story and recover the buried treasure ana departed guam on april 10 and after two days at wake island found and salvaged the buried coins and precious stones as well as a small quantity of the quicksilver the wreck of dashing wave on july 29 1870 the british tea clipper dashing wave under the command of captain henry vandervord sailed out of foochoo china en route to sydney australia on august 31 the weather was very thick and it was blowing a heavy gale from the eastward attended with violent squalls and a tremendous sea at 1030pm breakers were seen and the ship struck the reef at wake island overnight the vessel began to break up and at 1000am the crew succeeded in launching the longboat over the leeward side in the chaos of the evacuation the captain secured a chart and nautical instruments but no compass the crew loaded a case of wine some bread and two buckets but no drinking water since wake island appeared to have neither food nor water the captain and his 12-man crew quickly departed crafting a makeshift sail by attaching a blanket to an oar with no water each man was allotted a glass of wine per day until a heavy rain shower came on the sixth day after 31 days of hardship drifting westward in the longboat they reached kosrae strongs island in the caroline islands capt vandervord attributed the loss of dashing wave to the erroneous manner in which wake island is laid down in the charts it is very low and not easily seen even on a clear night american possession with the annexation of hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of guam and the philippines during the spanishamerican war that same year the united states began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited wake island located approximately halfway between honolulu and manila as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding united states navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships on july 4 1898 united states army brigadier general francis v greene of the 2nd brigade philippine expeditionary force of the eighth army corps stopped at wake island and raised the american flag while en route to the philippines on the steamship liner ss china on january 17 1899 under orders from president william mckinley commander edward d taussig of ussbennington landed on wake and formally took possession of the island for the united states after a 21-gun salute the flag was raised and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription although the proposed route for the submarine cable would be shorter by 137 miles 220km midway and not wake island was chosen as the location for the telegraph cable station between honolulu and guam rear admiral royal bird bradford chief of the us navys bureau of equipment stated before the us house of representatives committee on interstate and foreign commerce on january 17 1902 that wake island seems at times to be swept by the sea it is only a few feet above the level of the ocean and if a cable station were established there very expensive works would be required besides it has no harbor while the midway islands are perfectly habitable and have a fair harbor for vessels of 18 feet 5m draught on june 23 1902 usatbuford commanded by captain alfred croskey and bound for manila spotted a ships boat on the beach as it passed closely by wake island soon thereafter the boat was launched by japanese on the island and sailed out to meet the transport the japanese told captain croskey that they had been put on the island by a schooner from yokohama in japan and that they were gathering guano and drying fish the captain suspected that they were also engaged in pearl hunting the japanese revealed that one of their parties needed medical attention and the captain determined from their descriptions of the symptoms that the illness was most likely beriberi they informed captain croskey that they did not need any provisions or water and that they were expecting the japanese schooner to return in a month or so the japanese declined an offer to be taken on the transport to manila and were given some medical supplies for the sick man some tobacco and a few incidentals after usat buford reached manila captain croskey reported on the presence of japanese at wake island he also learned that usatsheridan had a similar encounter at wake with the japanese the incident was brought to the attention of assistant secretary of the navy charles darling who at once informed the state department and suggested that an explanation from the japanese government was needed in august 1902 japanese minister takahira kogor provided a diplomatic note stating that the japanese government had no claim whatever to make on the sovereignty of the island but that if any subjects are found on the island the imperial government expects that they should be properly protected as long as they are engaged in peaceful occupations wake island was now clearly a territory of the united states but during this period the island was only occasionally visited by passing american ships one notable visit occurred in december 1906 when us army general john j pershing later famous as the commander of the american expeditionary forces in western europe during world war i stopped at wake on usatthomas and hoisted a 45-star us flag that was improvised out of sail canvas feather poaching with limited fresh water resources no harbor and no plans for development wake island remained a remote uninhabited pacific island in the early 20th century it did however have a large seabird population that attracted japanese feather poachers the global demand for feathers and plumage was driven by the millinery industry and popular european fashion designs for hats while other demand came from pillow and bedspread manufacturers japanese poachers set up camps to harvest feathers on many remote islands in the central pacific the feather trade was primarily focused on laysan albatross black-footed albatross masked booby lesser frigatebird greater frigatebird sooty tern and other species of tern on february 6 1904 rear admiral robley d evans arrived at wake island on ussadams and observed japanese collecting feathers and catching sharks for their fins abandoned feather poaching camps were seen by the crew of the submarine tender ussbeaver in 1922 and usstanager in 1923 although feather collecting and plumage exploitation had been outlawed in the territorial united states there is no record of any enforcement actions at wake island japanese castaways in january 1908 the japanese ship toyoshima maru en route from tateyama japan to the south pacific encountered a heavy storm that disabled the ship and swept the captain and five of the crew overboard the 36 remaining crew members managed to make landfall on wake island where they endured five months of great hardship disease and starvation in may 1908 the brazilian navy training ship benjamin constant while on a voyage around the world passed by the island and spotted a tattered red distress flag unable to land a boat the crew executed a challenging three-day rescue operation using rope and cable in order to bring on board the 20 survivors and transport them to yokohama uss beaver strategic survey in his 1921 book sea-power in the pacific a study of the american-japanese naval problem hector c bywater recommended establishing a well-defended fueling station at wake island in order to provide coal and oil for united states navy ships engaged in future operations against japan on june 19 1922 the submarine tender ussbeaver landed an investigating party to determine the practicality and feasibility of establishing a naval fueling station on wake island lt cmdr sherwood picking reported that from a strategic point of view wake island could not be better located dividing as it does with midway the passage from honolulu to guam into almost exact thirds he observed that the boat channel was choked with coral heads and that the lagoon was very shallow and not over 15 feet 5m in depth and therefore wake would not be able to serve as a base for surface vessels picking suggested clearing the channel to the lagoon for loaded motor sailing launches so that parties on shore could receive supplies from passing ships and he strongly recommended that wake be used as a base for aircraft picking stated that if the long heralded trans-pacific flight ever takes place wake island should certainly be occupied and used as an intermediate resting and fueling port tanager expedition in 1923 a joint expedition by the then bureau of the biological survey in the us department of agriculture the bernice pauahi bishop museum and the united states navy was organized to conduct a thorough biological reconnaissance of the northwestern hawaiian islands then administered by the biological survey bureau as the hawaiian islands bird reservation on february 1 1923 secretary of agriculture henry c wallace contacted secretary of navy edwin denby to request navy participation and recommended expanding the expedition to johnston midway and wake all islands not administered by the department of agriculture on july 27 1923 usstanager a world war i minesweeper brought the tanager expedition to wake island under the leadership of ornithologist alexander wetmore and a tent camp was established on the eastern end of wilkes from july 27 to august 5 the expedition charted the atoll made extensive zoological and botanical observations and gathered specimens for the bishop museum while the naval vessel under the command of lt cmdr samuel wilder king conducted a sounding survey offshore other achievements at wake included examinations of three abandoned japanese feather poaching camps scientific observations of the now extinct wake island rail and confirmation that wake island is an atoll with a group comprising three islands with a central lagoon wetmore named the southwest island for charles wilkes who had led the original pioneering united states exploring expedition to wake in 1841 the northwest island was named for titian peale the chief naturalist of that 1841 expedition pan american airways and the us navy juan trippe president of the worlds then largest airline pan american airways paa wanted to expand globally by offering passenger air service between the united states and china to cross the pacific ocean his planes would need to island-hop stopping at various points for refueling and maintenance he first tried to plot the route on his globe but it showed only open sea between midway and guam next he went to the new york public library to study 19th-century clipper ship logs and charts and he discovered a little-known coral atoll named wake island to proceed with his plans at wake and midway trippe would need to be granted access to each island and approval to construct and operate facilities however the islands were not under the jurisdiction of any specific us government entity meanwhile us navy military planners and the state department were increasingly alarmed by the empire of japans expansionist attitude and growing belligerence in the western pacific following world war i the council of the league of nations had granted the south pacific mandate nanyo to japan which had joined the allied powers in the first world war which included the already japanese-held micronesia islands north of the equator that were part of the former colony of german new guinea of the german empire these include the modern nationstates of palau federated states of micronesia northern mariana islands and marshall islands in the 1920s and 1930s japan restricted access to its mandated territory and began to develop harbors and airfields throughout micronesia in defiance of the washington naval treaty of 1922 which prohibited both the united states and japan from expanding military fortifications in the pacific islands now with trippes planned pan american airways aviation route passing through wake and midway the us navy and the state department saw an opportunity to project american air power across the pacific under the guise of a commercial aviation enterprise on october 3 1934 trippe wrote to the secretary of the navy requesting a five-year lease on wake island with an option for four renewals given the potential military value of paas base development on november 13 chief of naval operations admiral william h standley ordered a survey of wake by ussnitro and on december 29 president franklin d roosevelt issued executive order 6935 which placed wake island and also johnston sand island at midway and kingman reef under the control of the department of the navy in an attempt to disguise the navys military intentions rear admiral harry e yarnell then designated wake island as a bird sanctuary uss nitro arrived at wake island on march 8 1935 and conducted a two-day ground marine and aerial survey providing the navy with strategic observations and complete photographic coverage of the atoll four days later on march 12 secretary of the navy claude a swanson formally granted pan american airways permission to construct facilities at wake island pan american airways base for the flying clippers to construct bases in the pacific pan american airways paa chartered the 6700-ton freighter ss north haven which arrived at wake island on may 9 1935 with construction workers and the necessary materials and equipment to start to build pan american facilities and to clear the lagoon for a flying boat landing area the atolls encircling coral reef prevented the ship from entering and anchoring in the shallow lagoon itself the only suitable location for ferrying supplies and workers ashore was at nearby wilkes island however the chief engineer of the expedition charles r russell determined that wilkes was too low and at times flooded and that peale island was the best site for the pan american facilities to offload the ship cargo was lightered barged from ship to shore carried across wilkes and then transferred to another barge and towed across the lagoon to peale island by inspiration someone had earlier loaded railroad track rails onto north haven so the men built a narrow-gauge railway to make it easier to haul the supplies across wilkes to the lagoon on june 12 north haven departed for guam leaving behind various paa technicians and a construction crew out in the middle of the lagoon bill mullahey a swimmer from columbia university was tasked with blasting hundreds of coral heads from a 1 mile 1600m long 300 yards 300m wide 6 feet 2m deep landing area for the flying boats on august 17 the first aircraft landing at wake island occurred when a paa flying boat on a survey flight of the route between midway and wake landed in the lagoon the second expedition of north haven arrived at wake island on february 5 1936 to complete the construction of the paa facilities a five-ton diesel locomotive for the wilkes island railroad was offloaded and the railway track was extended to run from dock to dock across the lagoon on peale workers assembled the pan american hotel a prefabricated structure with 48 rooms and wide porches and verandas the hotel consisted of two wings built out from a central lobby with each room having a bathroom with a hot-water shower the paa facilities staff included a group of chamorro men from guam who were employed as kitchen helpers hotel service attendants and laborers the village on peale was nicknamed paaville and was the first permanent human settlement on wake by october 1936 pan american airways was ready to transport passengers across the pacific on its small fleet of three martin m-130 flying clippers on october 11 the china clipper landed at wake on a press flight with ten journalists on board a week later on october 18 paa president juan trippe and a group of vip passengers arrived at wake on the philippine clipper nc14715 on october 25 the hawaii clipper nc14714 landed at wake with the first paying airline passengers ever to cross the pacific in 1937 wake island became a regular stop for paas international trans-pacific passenger and airmail service with two scheduled flights per week one westbound from midway and one eastbound from guam wake island is credited with being one of the early successes of hydroponics which enabled pan american airways to grow vegetables for its passengers as it was very expensive to airlift in fresh vegetables and the island lacked natural soil paaville remained in operation up to the day of the first japanese air raid in december 1941 forcing the us into world war ii see below military buildup on february 14 1941 president franklin d roosevelt issued executive order 8682 to create naval defense areas in the central pacific territories the proclamation established wake island naval defensive sea area which encompassed the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding wake wake island naval airspace reservation was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area only us government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at wake island unless authorized by the secretary of the navy just earlier in january 1941 the united states navy began construction of a military base on the atoll on august 19 the first permanent military garrison elements of the us marine corps first marine defense battalion totaling 449 officers and men were stationed on the island commanded by navy cmdr winfield scott cunningham also on the island were 68 us naval personnel and about 1221 civilian workers from the american firm morrison-knudsen corp world war ii battle of wake island on december 8 1941 the day of the attack on pearl harbor december 7 in hawaii which is on the other side of the international date line at least 27 japanese mitsubishi g3m nell medium bombers flown from bases on kwajalein in the marshall islands attacked wake island destroying eight of the 12 grumman f4f wildcat fighter aircraft belonging to united states marine corps fighter squadron 211 vmf-211 on the ground the marine garrisons defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid which primarily targeted the aircraft the garrison supplemented by civilian construction workers employed by morrison-knudsen corp repelled several japanese landing attempts an american journalist reported that after the initial japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses on december 11 the american commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything popular legend has it that maj james devereux sent back the message send us more japs a reply that became famous after the war when maj devereux learned that he had been credited with sending that message he pointed out that he had not been the commander on wake island and denied sending the message as far as i know it wasnt sent at all none of us was that much of a damn fool we already had more japs than we could handle in reality commander winfield s cunningham usn was in charge of wake island not devereux cunningham ordered that coded messages be sent during operations and a junior officer had added send us and more japs to the beginning and end of a message to confuse japanese code breakers this was put together at pearl harbor and passed on as part of the message the us navy attempted to provide support from hawaii but had suffered great losses at pearl harbor the relief fleet they managed to organize was delayed by bad weather the isolated us garrison was overwhelmed by a reinforced and greatly superior japanese invasion force on december 23 american casualties numbered 52 military personnel navy and marine and approximately 70 civilians killed japanese losses exceeded 700 dead with some estimates ranging as high as 1000 wakes defenders sank two japanese fast transports p32 and p33 and one submarine and shot down 24 japanese aircraft the relief fleet en route on hearing of the islands loss turned back in the aftermath of the battle most of the captured civilians and military personnel were sent to pow camps in asia though some of the civilian laborers were enslaved by the japanese and tasked with improving the islands defenses japanese occupation and surrender the islands japanese garrison was composed of the ijn 65th guard unit 2000 men japan navy capt shigematsu sakaibara and the ija units which became 13th independent mixed regiment 1939 men under command of col shigeji chikamori the japanese-occupied island called by them torishima or big bird island for its birdlike shape was bombed several times by american aircraft one of these raids was the first mission for future united states president george hw bush after a successful american air raid on october 5 1943 sakaibara ordered the execution of all of the 98 captured americans who remained on the island they were taken to the northern end of the island blindfolded and machine-gunned one prisoner escaped carving the message 98 us pw 5-10-43 on a large coral rock near where the victims had been hastily buried in a mass grave this unknown american was soon recaptured and beheaded sakaibara and his subordinate lt cmdr tachibana were later sentenced to death after conviction for this and other war crimes tachibanas sentence was later commuted to life in prison sakaibara was executed on june 18 1947 on guam the remains of the murdered civilians were exhumed and reburied at the national memorial cemetery of the pacific in section g on september 4 1945 the japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of united states marines under the command of brig gen lawson h m sanderson at that point the garrison had been almost cut off from supplies since the 1943 air raids and was reduced to the point of starvation while the islands sooty tern colony had received some protection as a source of eggs the wake island rail was hunted to extinction by the starving soldiers ultimately about three-quarters of the japanese garrison perished and the rest survived only by eating tern eggs the pacific rats introduced by prehistoric voyagers and what scant amount of vegetables they could grow in makeshift gardens among the coral rubble post-world war ii military and commercial airfield with the end of hostilities with japan and the increase in international air travel driven in part by wartime advances in aeronautics wake island became a critical mid-pacific base for the servicing and refueling of military and commercial aircraft the united states navy resumed control of the island and in october 1945 400 seabees from the 85th naval construction battalion arrived at wake to clear the island of the effects of the war and to build basic facilities for a naval air base the base was completed in march 1946 and on september 24 regular commercial passenger service was resumed by pan american airways pan am the era of the flying boats was nearly over so pan am switched to longer-range faster and more profitable airplanes that could land on wakes new coral runway other airlines that established transpacific routes through wake included british overseas airways corporation boac philippine airlines and transocean airlines due to the substantial increase in the number of commercial flights on july 1 1947 the navy transferred administration operations and maintenance of the facilities at wake to the civil aeronautics administration caa in 1949 the caa upgraded the runway by paving over the coral surface and extending its length to 7000 feet korean war in june 1950 the korean war began with the united states leading united nations forces against north korea in july the korean airlift was started and the military air transport service mats used the airfield and facilities at wake as a key mid-pacific refueling stop for its mission of transporting men and supplies to the korean front by september 120 military aircraft were landing at wake per day on october 15 us president harry s truman and gen douglas macarthur met at the wake island conference to discuss progress and war strategy for the korean peninsula they chose to meet at wake island because of its close proximity to korea so that macarthur would not have to be away from the troops in the field for long during 1953 the last year of the war more than 85 of the air traffic through wake was military aircraft or civilian contract carriers supporting the korean war effort tanker shipwreck and oil spill on september 6 1967 standard oil of californias 18000-ton tanker ss rc stoner was driven onto the reef at wake island by a strong southwesterly wind after the ship failed to moor to the two buoys near the harbor entrance an estimated six million gallons of refined fuel oil including 57 million gallons of aviation fuel 168000 gallons of diesel oil and 138600 gallons of bunker c fuel spilled into the small boat harbor and along the southwestern coast of wake island to peacock point large numbers of fish were killed by the oil spill and personnel from the faa and crewmen from the ship cleared the area closest to the spill of dead fish the us navy salvage team harbor clearance unit two and pacific fleet salvage officer cmdr john b orem flew to wake to assess the situation and by september 13 the navy tugs ussmataco and usswandank salvage ships ussconserver and ussgrapple tanker ussnoxubee and uscgcmallow arrived from honolulu guam and subic bay in the philippines to assist in the cleanup and removal of the vessel at the boat harbor the salvage team pumped and skimmed oil which they burned each evening in nearby pits recovery by the navy salvage team of the rc stoner and its remaining cargo however was hampered by strong winds and heavy seas on september 16 super typhoon sarah made landfall on wake island at peak intensity with winds up to 145-knots causing widespread damage the intensity of the storm had the beneficial effect of greatly accelerating the cleanup effort by clearing the harbor and scouring the coast oil did remain however embedded in the reefs flat crevices and impregnated in the coral the storm also had broken the wrecked vessel into three sections and although delayed by rough seas and harassment by blacktip reef sharks the salvage team used explosives to flatten and sink the remaining portions of the ship that were still above water commercial aviation ends and the us air force assumes control in the early 1970s higher-efficiency jet aircraft with longer-range capabilities lessened the use of wake island airfield as a refueling stop and the number of commercial flights landing at wake declined sharply pan am had replaced many of its boeing 707s with more efficient 747s thus eliminating the need to continue weekly stops at wake other airlines began to eliminate their scheduled flights into wake in june 1972 the last scheduled pan am passenger flight landed at wake and in july pan ams last cargo flight departed the island marking the end of the heyday of wake islands commercial aviation history during this same time period the us military had transitioned to longer-range c-5a and c-141 aircraft leaving the c-130 as the only aircraft that would continue to regularly use the islands airfield the steady decrease in air traffic control activities at wake island was apparent and was expected to continue into the future on june 24 1972 responsibility for the civil administration of wake island was transferred from the faa to the united states air force under an agreement between the secretary of the interior and the secretary of the air force in july the faa turned over administration of the island to the military airlift command mac although legal ownership stayed with the department of the interior and the faa continued to maintain the air navigation facilities and provide air traffic control services on december 27 the chief of staff of the air force csaf gen john d ryan directed mac to phase out en-route support activity at wake island effective june 30 1973 on july 1 1973 all faa activities ended and the us air force under pacific air forces pacaf detachment 4 15th air base wing assumed control of wake island in 1973 wake island was selected as a launch site for the testing of defensive systems against intercontinental ballistic missiles under the us armys project have mill air force personnel on wake and the air force systems command afsc space and missile systems organization samso
