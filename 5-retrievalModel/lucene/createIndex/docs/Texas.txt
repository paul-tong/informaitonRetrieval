struggle for independence from mexico the lone star can be found on the texas state flag and on the texan state seal the origin of texass name is from the word taysha which means friends in the caddo language due to its size and geologic features such as the balcones fault texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the us southern and southwestern regions although texas is popularly associated with the us southwestern deserts less than 10 of texass land area is desert most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies grasslands forests and the coastline traveling from east to west one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods to rolling plains and rugged hills and finally the desert and mountains of the big bend the term six flags over texas refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory spain was the first european country to claim the area of texas france held a short-lived colony mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when texas won its independence becoming an independent republic in 1845 texas joined the union as the 28th state the states annexation set off a chain of events that led to the mexicanamerican war in 1846 a slave state before the american civil war texas declared its secession from the us in early 1861 and officially joined the confederate states of america on march 2 of the same year after the civil war and the restoration of its representation in the federal government texas entered a long period of economic stagnation historically four major industries shaped the texas economy prior to world war ii cattle and bison cotton timber and oil before and after the us civil war the cattle industry which texas came to dominate was a major economic driver for the state thus creating the traditional image of the texas cowboy in the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative it was ultimately though the discovery of major petroleum deposits spindletop in particular that initiated an economic boom which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century with strong investments in universities texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century as of 2015 it is second on the list of the most fortune 500 companies with 54 with a growing base of industry the state leads in many industries including agriculture petrochemicals energy computers and electronics aerospace and biomedical sciences texas has led the us in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product if texas were a sovereign state it would be the 10th largest economy in the world etymology the name texas based on the caddo word tysha taja friend was applied in the spelling tejas or texas by the spanish to the caddo themselves specifically the hasinai confederacy the final -s representing the spanish plural the mission san francisco de los tejas was completed near the hasinai village of nabedaches in may 1690 in what is now houston county east texas during spanish colonial rule in the 18th century the area was known as nuevo reino de filipinas new kingdom of the philippines or as provincia de los tejas province of the tejas later also provincia de texas or de tejas province of texas it was incorporated as provincia de texas into the mexican empire in 1821 and declared a republic in 1836 the royal spanish academy recognizes both spellings tejas and texas as spanish-language forms of the name of the us state of texas the english pronunciation with ks is unetymological and based in the value of the letter x in historical spanish orthography alternative etymologies of the name advanced in the late 19th century connected the spanish teja rooftile the plural tejas being used to designate indigenous pueblo settlements a 1760s map by jacques-nicolas bellin shows a village named teijas on trinity river close to the site of modern crockett geography texas is the second-largest us state after alaska with an area of 268820 square miles 696200km though 10 larger than france and almost twice as large as germany or japan it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size if it were an independent country texas would be the 40th largest behind chile and zambia texas is in the south central part of the united states of america three of its borders are defined by rivers the rio grande forms a natural border with the mexican states of chihuahua coahuila nuevo len and tamaulipas to the south the red river forms a natural border with oklahoma and arkansas to the north the sabine river forms a natural border with louisiana to the east the texas panhandle has an eastern border with oklahoma at 100 w a northern border with oklahoma at 3630 n and a western border with new mexico at 103 w el paso lies on the states western tip at 32 n and the rio grande with 10 climatic regions 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils topography geology rainfall and plant and animal communities one classification system divides texas in order from southeast to west into the following gulf coastal plains interior lowlands great plains and basin and range province the gulf coastal plains region wraps around the gulf of mexico on the southeast section of the state vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods the interior lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest the great plains region in central texas is in spans through the states panhandle and llano estacado to the states hill country near austin this region is dominated by prairie and steppe far west texas or the trans-pecos region is the states basin and range province the most varied of the regions this area includes sand hills the stockton plateau desert valleys wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands texas has 3700 named streams and 15 major rivers with the rio grande as the largest other major rivers include the pecos the brazos colorado and red river while texas has few natural lakes texans have built over 100 artificial reservoirs the size and unique history of texas make its regional affiliation debatable it can be fairly considered a southern or a southwestern state or both the vast geographic economic and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the united states notable extremes range from east texas which is often considered an extension of the deep south to far west texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior southwest geology texas is the southernmost part of the great plains which ends in the south against the folded sierra madre occidental of mexico the continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the gulf of mexico the oldest rocks in texas date from the mesoproterozoic and are about 1600 million years old these precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three places llano uplift van horn and the franklin mountains near el paso sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks the oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin or passive margin that developed during cambrian time this margin existed until laurasia and gondwana collided in the pennsylvanian subperiod to form pangea this is the buried crest of the appalachian mountainsouachita mountains zone of pennsylvanian continental collision this orogenic crest is today buried beneath the dallaswacoaustinsan antonio trend the late paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the jurassic period began to open the gulf of mexico pangea began to break up in the triassic but seafloor spreading to form the gulf of mexico occurred only in the mid and late jurassic the shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the gulf of mexico passive margin began to form today 9 to 12 miles 14 to 19km of sediments are buried beneath the texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining us oil reserves are here at the start of its formation the incipient gulf of mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of jurassic age these salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs and are found in east texas along the gulf coast east texas outcrops consist of cretaceous and paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of eocene lignite the mississippian and pennsylvanian sediments in the north permian sediments in the west and cretaceous sediments in the east along the gulf coast and out on the texas continental shelf contain oil oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west texas in the big bend area a blanket of miocene sediments known as the ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer located far from an active plate tectonic boundary texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes wildlife a wide range of animals and insects live in texas it is the home to 65 species of mammals 213 species of reptiles and amphibians and the greatest diversity of bird life in the united states590 native species in all at least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in texas texas plays host to several species of wasps texas is one of the regions that has the highest abundance of polistes exclamans additionally texas has provided an important ground for the study of polistes annularis during the spring texas wildflowers such as the state flower the bluebonnet line highways throughout texas during the johnson administration the first lady lady bird johnson worked to draw attention to texas wildflowers climate the large size of texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather the panhandle of the state has colder winters than north texas while the gulf coast has mild winters texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns el paso on the western end of the state averages 87 inches 220mm of annual rainfall while parts of southeast texas average as much as 64 inches 1600mm per year dallas in the north central region averages a more moderate 37 inches 940mm per year snow falls multiple times each winter in the panhandle and mountainous areas of west texas once or twice a year in north texas and once every few years in central and east texas snow falls south of san antonio or on the coast in rare circumstances only of note is the 2004 christmas eve snowstorm when 6 inches 150mm of snow fell as far south as kingsville where the average high temperature in december is 65f maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s f 26c in the mountains of west texas and on galveston island to around 100f 38c in the rio grande valley but most areas of texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90f 32c range night-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s f 14c in the west texas mountains to 80f 27c in galveston the table below consists of averages for august generally the warmest month and january generally the coldest in selected cities in various regions of the state el paso and amarillo are exceptions with july and december respectively being the warmest and coldest months respectively but with august and january only being narrowly different storms thunderstorms strike texas often especially the eastern and northern portions of the state tornado alley covers the northern section of texas the state experiences the most tornadoes in the united states an average of 139 a year these strike most frequently in north texas and the panhandle tornadoes in texas generally occur in the months of april may and june some of the most destructive hurricanes in us history have impacted texas a hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in indianola followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town these events allowed galveston to take over as the chief port city the 1900 galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city killing about 8000 people or possibly as many as 12000 this makes it the deadliest natural disaster in us history in 2017 hurricane harvey made landfall in rockport as a category4 hurricane causing significant damage there the storm stalled over land for a very long time allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain over the greater houston area and surrounding counties the result was widespread and catastrophic flooding that inundated hundreds of thousands of homes harvey ultimately became the costliest hurricane worldwide causing an estimated 1986 billion in damage surpassing the cost of hurricane katrina other devastating texas hurricanes include the 1915 galveston hurricane hurricane audrey in 1957 which killed over 600 people hurricane carla in 1961 hurricane beulah in 1967 hurricane alicia in 1983 hurricane rita in 2005 and hurricane ike in 2008 tropical storms have also caused their share of damage allison in 1989 and again during 2001 and claudette in 1979 among them greenhouse gases texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the us the state emits nearly 15 trillion pounds 680 billion kg of carbon dioxide annually as an independent nation texas would rank as the worlds seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases causes of the states vast greenhouse gas emissions include the states large number of coal power plants and the states refining and manufacturing industries in 2010 there were 2553 emission events which poured 446 million pounds of contaminants into the texas sky history pre-european era texas lies between two major cultural spheres of pre-columbian north america the southwestern and the plains areas archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their developmental peak before the first european contact these were the pueblo from the upper rio grande region centered west of texas the mississippian culture also known as mound builders which extended along the mississippi river valley east of texas and the civilizations of mesoamerica centered south of texas influence of teotihuacan in northern mexico peaked around ad 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries when europeans arrived in the texas region there were several races of native peoples divided into many smaller tribes they were caddoan atakapan athabaskan coahuiltecan uto-aztecan the uto-aztecan puebloan peoples lived neared the rio grande in the western portion of the state the athabaskan-speaking apache tribes lived throughout the interior the caddoans controlled much of the red river region the atakapans were mostly centered along the gulf coast at least one tribe of coahuiltecans the aranama lived in southern texas this entire culture group primarily centered in northeastern mexico is now extinct it is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally by the time the region came to be explored it belonged to the fairly well-known comanche another uto-aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century it may have been claimed by several different peoples including uto-aztecans athabaskans or even dhegihan siouans no culture was dominant in the present-day texas region and many peoples inhabited the area native american tribes that lived inside the boundaries of present-day texas include the alabama apache atakapan bidai caddo aranama comanche choctaw coushatta hasinai jumano karankawa kickapoo kiowa tonkawa and wichita the name texas derives from tysha a word in the caddoan language of the hasinai which means friends or allies the region was primarily controlled by the spanish for the first couple centuries of contact until the texas revolution they were not particularly kind to their native populationseven less so with the caddoans who were not trusted as their culture was split between the spanish the french when the spanish briefly managed to conquer the louisiana colony they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the indians which they continued even after the french took back the colony after the 1803 louisiana purchase the united states inherited this odd circumstance the caddoans preferred the company of americans almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of louisiana arkansas the spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time effort and began trying to lure the caddo back even promising them more land seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it the united states who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the louisiana purchase faced an overflow of native peoples in missouri arkansas were able to negotiate with the caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern texas they included the muscogee houma choctaw lenape mingo seneca among others who all came to view the caddoans as saviors making those peoples highly influential whether a native american tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of european explorers and settlers in that land friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops prepare foods and hunt wild game warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers during the texas revolution the us became heavily involved prior treaties with the spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations at that time several sudden outbreaks of violence between caddoans texans started to spread the caddoans were always clueless when questioned the texan american authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it often it was so far flung from caddoan lands it barely made any sense it seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treatiespreferably on the side of the spanish while no proof was found as to who the culprit was those in charge of texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the caddoans for the incidents with the us government trying to keep them in check furthermore the caddoans never turned to violence because of it excepting cases of self-defense by the 1830s the us had drafted the indian removal act which was used to facilitate the trail of tears fearing retribution of other native peoples indian agents all over the eastern us began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west this included the caddoans of louisiana arkansas following the texas revolution the texans chose to make peace with their native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements this began the movement of native populations north into what would become indian territorymodern day oklahoma colonization the first historical document related to texas was a map of the gulf coast created in 1519 by spanish explorer alonso lvarez de pineda nine years later shipwrecked spanish explorer lvar nez cabeza de vaca and his cohort became the first europeans in what is now texas cabeza de vaca reported that in 1528 when the spanish landed in the area half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us cabeza de vaca also made observations about the way of life of the ignaces natives of texas they went about with a firebrand setting fire to the plains and timber so as to drive off the mosquitos and also to get lizards and similar things which they eat to come out of the soil in the same manner they kill deer encircling them with fires and they do it also to deprive the animals of pasture compelling them to go for food where the indians want francisco vzquez de coronado describes his 1541 encounter with two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows one is called querechos and the others teyas they are very well built and painted and are enemies of each other they have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows they kill all of these they wish and tan the hides with which they clothe themselves and make their tents and they eat the flesh sometimes even raw and they also even drink the blood when thirsty the tents they make are like field tents and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose which come together and are tied at the top and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have of which they have many and they load them with the tents and poles and other things for the country is so level as i said that they can make use of these because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground the sun is what they worship most european powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685 miscalculations by ren-robert cavelier de la salle resulted in his establishing the colony of fort saint louis at matagorda bay rather than along the mississippi river the colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives in 1690 spanish authorities concerned that france posed competitive threat constructed several missions in east texas after native american resistance the spanish missionaries returned to mexico when france began settling louisiana mostly in the southern part of the state in 1716 spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in east texas two years later they created san antonio as the first spanish civilian settlement in the area hostile native tribes and distance from nearby spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area it was one of new spains least populated provinces in 1749 the spanish peace treaty with the lipan apache angered many tribes including the comanche tonkawa and hasinai the comanche signed a treaty with spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the lipan apache and karankawa tribes with more numerous missions being established priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes by the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to christianity when the united states purchased louisiana from france in 1803 american authorities insisted the agreement also included texas the boundary between new spain and the united states was finally set at the sabine river in 1819 at what is now the border between texas and louisiana eager for new land many united states settlers refused to recognize the agreement several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the sabine river in 1821 the mexican war of independence included the texas territory which became part of mexico due to its low population mexico made the area part of the state of coahuila y tejas hoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant comanche raids mexican texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside mexico and spain under the mexican immigration system large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios who recruited settlers from the united states europe and the mexican interior the first grant to moses austin was passed to his son stephen f austin after his death austins settlers the old three hundred made places along the brazos river in 1822 twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state the majority of whom were from the united states the population of texas grew rapidly in 1825 texas had about 3500 people with most of mexican descent by 1834 the population had grown to about 37800 people with only 7800 of mexican descent most of these early settlers who arrived with austin and soon after were persons less than fortunate in life as texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in mexico and the united states during that time early texas settler david b edwards described his fellow texans as being banished from the pleasures of life many immigrants openly flouted mexican law especially the prohibition against slavery combined with united states attempts to purchase texas mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the united states new laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering both native mexican citizens tejanos and recent immigrants the anahuac disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in mexico against the nations president texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all mexican soldiers out of east texas they took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom texians met at the convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood among other issues the following year texians reiterated their demands at the convention of 1833 republic within mexico tensions continued between federalists and centralists in early 1835 wary texians formed committees of correspondence and safety the unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the battle of gonzales this launched the texas revolution and over the next two months the texians defeated all mexican troops in the region texians elected delegates to the consultation which created a provisional government the provisional government soon collapsed from infighting and texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836 during this time of political turmoil mexican president antonio lpez de santa anna personally led an army to end the revolt the mexican expedition was initially successful general jos de urrea defeated all the texian resistance along the coast culminating in the goliad massacre santa annas forces after a thirteen-day siege overwhelmed texian defenders at the battle of the alamo news of the defeats sparked panic among texas settlers the newly elected texian delegates to the convention of 1836 quickly signed a declaration of independence on march 2 forming the republic of texas after electing interim officers the convention disbanded the new government joined the other settlers in texas in the runaway scrape fleeing from the approaching mexican army after several weeks of retreat the texian army commanded by sam houston attacked and defeated santa annas forces at the battle of san jacinto santa anna was captured and forced to sign the treaties of velasco ending the war while texas had won its independence political battles raged between two factions of the new republic the nationalist faction led by mirabeau b lamar advocated the continued independence of texas the expulsion of the native americans and the expansion of the republic to the pacific ocean their opponents led by sam houston advocated the annexation of texas to the united states and peaceful co-existence with native americans the conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the texas archive war mexico launched two small expeditions into texas in 1842 the town of san antonio was captured twice and texans were defeated in battle in the dawson massacre despite these successes mexico did not keep an occupying force in texas and the republic survived the republics inability to defend itself added momentum to texass eventual annexation into the united states statehood as early as 1837 the republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the united states opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction along with strong abolitionist opposition within the united states slowed texass admission into the union texas was finally annexed when the expansionist james k polk won the election of 1844 on december 29 1845 congress admitted texas to the us as a constituent state of the union the population of the new state was quite small at first and there was a strong mix between the english-speaking american settlers that dominated in the states easternnortheastern portions and the spanish-speaking former mexicans that dominated in the states southern and western portions statehood brought many new settlers because of the long spanish presence in mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the spanish and mexicans in northern mexico there were large herds of longhorn cattle that roamed the state hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon thus creating the cowboy culture for which texas is famous while in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the us and the caribbean within a few decades beef had become a staple of the american diet after texass annexation mexico broke diplomatic relations with the united states while the united states claimed texass border stretched to the rio grande mexico claimed it was the nueces river while the former republic of texas could not enforce its border claims the united states had the military strength and the political will to do so president polk ordered general zachary taylor south to the rio grande on january 13 1846 a few months later mexican troops routed an american cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the thornton affair starting the mexicanamerican war the first battles of the war were fought in texas the siege of fort texas battle of palo alto and battle of resaca de la palma after these decisive victories the united states invaded mexican territory ending the fighting in texas after a series of united states victories the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo ended the two-year war in return for us18250000 mexico gave the us undisputed control of texas ceded the mexican cession in 1848 most of which today is called the american southwest and texass borders were established at the rio grande the compromise of 1850 set texass boundaries at their present form us senator james pearce of maryland drafted the final proposal where texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day new mexico a third of colorado and small portions of kansas oklahoma and wyoming to the federal government in return for the assumption of 10 million of the old republics debt post-war texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state they also brought or purchased enslaved african americans whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 from 58000 to 182566 civil war and reconstruction 18601900 texas was at war again after the election of 1860 at this time blacks comprised 30 percent of the states population and they were overwhelmingly enslaved when abraham lincoln was elected south carolina seceded from the union five other lower south states quickly followed a state convention considering secession opened in austin on january 28 1861 on february 1 by a vote of 1668 the convention adopted an ordinance of secession from the united states texas voters approved this ordinance on february 23 1861 texas joined the newly created confederate states of america on march 4 1861 ratifying the permanent cs constitution on march 23 not all texans favored secession initially although many of the same would later support the southern cause texass most notable unionist was the state governor sam houston not wanting to aggravate the situation houston refused two offers from president lincoln for union troops to keep him in office after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the confederacy houston was deposed as governor while far from the major battlefields of the american civil war texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the confederacy union troops briefly occupied the states primary port galveston texass border with mexico was known as the backdoor of the confederacy because trade occurred at the border bypassing the union blockade the confederacy repulsed all union attempts to shut down this route but texass role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the union capture of the mississippi river the final battle of the civil war was fought near brownsville texas at palmito ranch with a confederate victory texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the army of northern virginia and the assumption of authority by union general gordon granger violence marked the early months of reconstruction juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the emancipation proclamation in galveston by general gordon granger almost two and a half years after the original announcement president johnson in 1866 declared the civilian government restored in texas despite not meeting reconstruction requirements congress resumed allowing elected texas representatives into the federal government in 1870 social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues like most of the south the texas economy was devastated by the war however since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the south it was able to recover more quickly the culture in texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory the state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt criminal prosecution or other problems indeed gone to texas was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states nevertheless the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well the cattle industry continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at galveston as commerce between texas and the rest of the us and the rest of the world expanded as with some other states before the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of texas such that by the early 20th century the majority of the forest population in texas was gone later conservation efforts restored some of it but never to the level it once was earlier 20th century in 1900 texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in us history during the galveston hurricane on january 10 1901 the first major oil well in texas spindletop was found south of beaumont other fields were later discovered nearby in east texas west texas and under the gulf of mexico the resulting oil boom transformed texas oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972 in 1901 the democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting which effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites and latinos in addition the legislature established white primaries ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process the number of voters dropped dramatically and the democrats crushed competition from the republican and populist parties the socialist party became the second-largest party in texas after 1912 coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the united states during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like eugene v debs the socialists popularity soon waned after their vilification by the united states government for their opposition to us involvement in world war i the great depression and the dust bowl dealt a double blow to the states economy which had significantly improved since the civil war migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of texas during the dust bowl years especially from this period on blacks left texas in the great migration to get work in the northern united states or california and to escape the oppression of segregation in 1940 texas was 74 percent anglo 144 percent black and 115 percent hispanic world war ii had a dramatic impact on texas as federal money poured in to build military bases munitions factories pow detention camps and army hospitals 750000 young men left for service the cities exploded with new industry the colleges took on new roles and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better paying war jobs never to return to agriculture texas manufactured 31 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking eleventh among the 48 states texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s the state created a comprehensive plan for higher education funded in large part by oil revenues and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently these changes helped texas universities receive federal research funds on november 22 1963 president john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas economic and political change 1950present beginning around the mid-20th century texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized the states population grew quickly during this period with large levels of migration from outside the state as a part of the sun belt texas experienced strong economic growth particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s texass economy diversified lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry by 1990 hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state during the late 20th century the republican party replaced the democratic party as the dominant party in the state as the latter became more politically liberal and as demographic changes favored the former government and politics the current texas constitution was adopted in 1876 like many states it explicitly provides for a separation of powers the states bill of rights is much larger than its federal counterpart and has provisions unique to texas state government texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor which is a weak executive compared to some other states except for the secretary of state voters elect executive officers independently thus candidates are directly answerable to the public not the governor this election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program when republican president george w bush served as texass governor the state had a democratic lieutenant governor bob bullock the executive branch positions consist of the governor lieutenant governor comptroller of public accounts land commissioner attorney general agriculture

politics political history in the 1870s white democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of reconstruction in the early 20th century the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes followed by white primaries these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks poor whites and mexican americans in the 1890s 100000 blacks voted in the state by 1906 only 5000 could vote as a result the democratic party dominated texas politics from the turn of the century imposing racial segregation and white supremacy it held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens although texas was essentially a one-party state during this time and the democratic primary was viewed as the real election the democratic party had conservative and liberal factions which became more pronounced after the new deal additionally several factions of the party briefly split during the 1930s and 1940s the states conservative white voters began to support republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century after this period they supported republicans for local and state offices as well and most whites became republican party members the party also attracted some minorities but many have continued to vote for democratic candidates the shift to the republican party is much-attributed to the fact the democratic party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average texas voter as texas was always a conservative state voters switched to the gop which now more closely reflected their beliefs commentators have also attributed the shift to republican political consultant karl rove who managed numerous political campaigns in texas in the 1980s and 1990s other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the sun belt that favored the republican party and conservatism the 2003 texas redistricting of congressional districts led by republican tom delay was called by the new york times an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering a group of democratic legislators the texas eleven fled the state in a quorum-busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting but was unsuccessful the state had already redistricted following the 2000 census despite these efforts the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of republicans based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since that date career attorneys and analysts at the department of justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of african american and hispanic voters but political appointees overrode them and approved it legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national supreme court in the case league of united latin american citizens v perry 2006 but the court ruled in favor of the state and republicans in the 2014 texas elections the tea party movement made large gains with numerous tea party favorites being elected into office including dan patrick as lieutenant governor ken paxton as attorney general in addition to numerous other candidates including conservative republican greg abbott as governor texas politics today texas voters lean toward fiscal conservatism while enjoying the benefits of huge federal investment in the state in military and other facilities achieved by the power of the solid south in the 20th century they also tend to have socially conservative values since 1980 most texas voters have supported republican presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004 republican george w bush won texas with respectively 593 and 601 percent of the vote partly due to his favorite son status as a former governor of the state john mccain won the state in 2008 but with a smaller margin of victory compared to bush at 55 percent of the vote austin dallas houston and san antonio consistently lean democratic in both local and statewide elections residents of counties along the rio grande closer to the mexico-united states border where there are many latino residents generally vote for
