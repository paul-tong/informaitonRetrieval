francisco vzquez de coronado y lujn spanish pronunciationfanisko ake e koonao 1510 22 september 1554 was a spanish conquistador and explorer who led a large expedition from mexico to present-day kansas through parts of the southwestern united states between 1540 and 1542 vzquez de coronado had hoped to reach the cities of cbola often referred to now as the mythical seven cities of gold which is a term not invented until american gold-rush days in the 1800s his expedition marked the first european sightings of the grand canyon and the colorado river among other landmarks his name is often anglicized as vasquez de coronado early life vzquez de coronado was born into a noble family in salamanca spain in 1510 as the second son of juan vzquez de coronado y sosa de ulloa and isabel de lujn juan vzquez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured emirate of granada under iigo lpez de mendoza its first spanish governor francisco vzquez de coronado went to new spain present-day mexico in 1535 at about age 25 in the entourage of its first viceroy antonio de mendoza the son of his fathers patron and vzquez de coronados personal friend in new spain he married twelve-year-old beatriz de estrada called the saint la santa sister of leonor de estrada ancestor of the de alvarado family and daughter of treasurer and governor alonso de estrada y hidalgo lord of picn and wife marina flores gutirrez de la caballera from a converso jewish family vzquez de coronado inherited a large portion of a mexican encomendero estate through beatriz and had eight children by her expedition preparation vzquez de coronado was the governor of the kingdom of nueva galicia new galicia a province of new spain located northwest of mexico and comprising the contemporary mexican states of jalisco sinaloa and nayarit in 1539 he dispatched friar marcos de niza and estevanico more properly known as estevan a survivor of the narvez expedition on an expedition north from compostela toward present-day new mexico when de niza returned he told of a city of vast wealth a golden city called cbola whose zuni residents were assumed to have killed estevan though he did not claim to have entered the city of cbola he mentioned that it stood on a high hill and that it appeared wealthy and as large as mexico city vzquez de coronado assembled an expedition with two components one component carried the bulk of the expeditions supplies traveling via the guadalupe river under the leadership of hernando de alarcn the other component traveled by land along the trail on which friar marcos de niza had followed esteban vzquez de coronado and viceroy antonio de mendoza invested large sums of their own money in the venture mendoza appointed vzquez de coronado the commander of the expedition with the mission to find the mythical seven cities of gold this is the reason he pawned his wifes estates and was lent 70000 pesos in the autumn of 1539 mendoza ordered melchior daz commander of the spanish outpost at san miguel de culiacn to investigate friar de nizas findings and on november 17 1539 daz departed for cbola with fifteen horsemen at the ruins of chichilticalli he turned around because of snows and fierce winds from across the wilderness daz had encountered vzquez de coronado before he had departed san miguel de culiacn and reported that initial investigations into friar de nizas report disproved the existence of the bountiful land he had described dazs report was delivered to viceroy mendoza on march 20 1540 expedition vzquez de coronado set out from compostela on february 23 1540 at the head of a much larger expedition composed of about 400 european men-at-arms mostly spaniards 1300 to 2000 mexican indian allies four franciscan friars the most notable of whom were juan de padilla and the newly appointed provincial superior of the franciscan order in the new world marcos de niza and several slaves both natives and africans many other family members and servants also joined the party he followed the sinaloan coast northward keeping the gulf of california on his left to the west until he reached the northernmost spanish settlement in mexico san miguel de culiacn about march 28 1540 whereupon he rested his expedition before they began trekking the inland trail aside from his mission to verify friar de nizas report melchior daz had also taken notice of the forage and food situation along the trail and reported that the land along the route would not be able to support a large concentrated body of soldiers and animals vzquez de coronado therefore decided to divide his expedition into small groups and time their departures so that grazing lands and water holes along the trail could recover at intervals along the trail vzquez de coronado established camps and stationed garrisons of soldiers to keep the supply route open for example in september 1540 melchior daz along with seventy or eighty of the weakest and least reliable men in vzquez de coronados army remained at the town of san hieronimo in the valley of corazones or hearts once the scouting and planning was done vzquez de coronado led the first group of soldiers up the trail they were horsemen and foot soldiers who were able to travel quickly while the main bulk of the expedition would set out later after leaving culiacan on april 22 1540 vzquez de coronado followed the coast bearing off to the left as mota padilla says by an extremely rough way to the sinaloa river the configuration of the country made it necessary to follow the river valley until he could find a passage across the mountains to the course of the yaqui river he traveled alongside this stream for some distance then crossed to the rio sonora which he followed nearly to its source before a pass was discovered on the southern side of the mountains he found a stream he called the nexpa which may have been either the santa cruz or the san pedro in modern arizona of modern maps most likely the northward-flowing san pedro river the party followed this river valley until they reached the edge of the wilderness where as friar marcos had described it to them they found chichilticalli chichilticalli is in southern arizona in the sulfur springs valley within the bend of the dos cabezas and chiricahua mountains this fits the chronicle of laus deo description which reports that at chichilticalli the country changes its character again and the spiky vegetation ceases the reason is that the mountain chain changes its direction at the same time that the coast does here they had to cross and pass the mountains in order to get into the level country there vzquez de coronado met a crushing disappointment cbola was nothing like the great golden city that de niza had described instead it was just a village of simple pueblos constructed by the zuni native americans the soldiers were upset with de niza for his mendacious imagination so vzquez de coronado sent him back south to new spain in disgrace despite what is shown in the accompanying map on-the-ground research by nugent brasher beginning in 2005 revealed evidence that vzquez de coronado traveled north between chichilticalli and zuni primarily on the future new mexico side of the state line not the arizona side as has been thought by historians since the 1940s also most scholars believe quivira was about thirty miles east of the great bend of the arkansas river ending about twenty miles west-southwest of the location depicted on the map with quivira being mostly on tributaries of the arkansas river instead of directly on the kansas river for details see the heading below location of quivira conquest of cbola vzquez de coronado traveled north on one side or the other of todays arizonanew mexico state line and from the headwaters of the little colorado river he continued on until he came to the zuni river he followed the zuni until he found the region inhabited by the zuni people the members of the expedition were almost starving and demanded entrance into the village of hawikuh of which the preferred zuni word is hawikku the natives refused denying the expedition entrance to the village vzquez de coronado and his expeditionaries attacked the zunis the ensuing skirmish constituted the extent of what can be called the spanish conquest of cbola during the battle vzquez de coronado was injured he never personally led his men-at-arms in any subsequent battles during the weeks that the expedition stayed at zuni he sent out several scouting expeditions the first scouting expedition was led by pedro de tovar this expedition headed northwest to the hopi villages which they recorded as tusayan upon arrival the spanish were also denied entrance to the village that they came across and once again resorted to using force to enter materially the hopi region was just as poor as the zuni in precious metals but the spaniards did learn that a large river the colorado lay to the west exploration of the colorado river three leaders affiliated with the vzquez de coronado expedition were able to reach the colorado river the first was hernando de alarcn then melchior daz and lastly garcia lopez de crdenas alarcns fleet was tasked to carry supplies and to establish contact with the main body of vzquez de coronados expedition but was unable to do so because of the extreme distance to cibola he traveled up the sea of corts and then the colorado river in this exploration he hauled some supplies for vzquez de coronado but eventually he buried them with a note in a bottle melchior daz was sent down from cbola by vzquez de coronado to take charge of the camp of corazones and to establish contact with the fleet soon after arriving at the camp he set out from the valley of corazones in sonora and traveled overland in a northnorthwesterly direction until he arrived at the junction of the colorado river and gila river there the local natives probably the cocomaricopa see seymour 2007b told him that alarcns sailors had buried supplies and left a note in a bottle the supplies were retrieved and the note stated that alarcns men had rowed up the river as far as they could searching in vain for the vzquez de coronado expedition they had given up and decided to return to their departure point because worms were eating holes in their boats daz named the river the firebrand tizn river because the natives in the area used firebrands to keep their bodies warm in the winter daz died on the trip back to the camp in the valley of the corazones while at hawikuh vzquez de coronado sent another scouting expedition overland to find the colorado river led by don garcia lpez de crdenas the expedition returned to hopi territory to acquire scouts and supplies members of crdenass party eventually reached the south rim of the grand canyon where they could see the colorado river thousands of feet below becoming the first europeans to do so after trying and failing to climb down into the canyon to reach the river the expedition reported that they would not be able to use the colorado river to link up with hernando de alarcns fleet after this the main body of the expedition began its journey to the next populated center of pueblos along another large river to the east the rio grande in new mexico tiguex war hernando de alvarado was sent to the east and found several villages around the rio grande vzquez de coronado had one commandeered for his winter quarters coofor which is across the river from present-day bernalillo near albuquerque new mexico during the winter of 154041 his army found themselves in conflict with the rio grande natives which led to the brutal tiguex war this war resulted in the destruction of the tiguex pueblos and the deaths of hundreds of native americans search for quivira from an indian the spanish called the turk el turco vzquez de coronado heard of a wealthy civilization called quivira far to the east in spring 1541 he led his army and priests and indian allies onto the great plains to search for quivira the turk was probably either a wichita or a pawnee and his intention seems to have been to lead vzquez de coronado astray and hope that he got lost in the wilderness with the turk guiding him vzquez de coronado and his army might have crossed the flat and featureless steppe called the llano estacado in the texas panhandle and eastern new mexico passing through the present-day communities of hereford and canadian the spanish were awed by the llano the country they the buffalo traveled over was so smooth that if one looked at them the sky could be seen between their legs men and horses became lost in the featureless plain and vzquez de coronado felt like he had been swallowed up by the sea on the llano vzquez de coronado encountered vast herds of bisonthe american buffalo i found such a quantity of cows that it is impossible to number them for while i was journeying through these plains there was not a day that i lost sight of them querechos and teyas vzquez de coronado found a settlement of people he called querechos the querechos were not awed or impressed by the spanish their weapons and their big dogs horses they did nothing unusual when they saw our army except to come out of their tents to look at us after which they came to talk to the advance guard and asked who we were as vzquez de coronado described them the querechos were nomads following the buffalo herds on the plains the querechos were numerous chroniclers mentioned one settlement of two hundred tipiswhich implies a population of more than one thousand people living together for at least part of the year authorities agree that the querechos becquerels were apache indians vzquez de coronado left the querechos behind and continued southeast in the direction in which the turk told him that quivira was located he and his army descended off the tabletop of the llano estacado into the caprock canyon country he soon met with another group of indians the teyas enemies of the querechos the teyas like the querechos were numerous and buffalo hunters although they had additional resources the canyons they inhabited had trees and flowing streams and they grew or foraged for beans but not corn the spanish however did note the presence of mulberries roses grapes walnuts and plums an intriguing event was vzquez de coronados meeting among the teyas an old blind bearded man who said that he had met many days before four others like us he was probably talking about cabeza de vaca who with esteban and two other spanish survivors of the narvez expedition to florida made his way across southern texas six years before vzquez de coronado scholars differ in their opinions as to which historical indian group were the teyas a plurality believe they were caddoan speakers and related to the wichita the place where vzquez de coronado found the teyas has also been debated the mystery may have been cleared upto the satisfaction of someby the discovery of a likely vzquez de coronado campsite while vzquez de coronado was in the canyon country his army suffered one of the violent climatic events so common on the plains a tempest came up one afternoon with a very high wind and hail the hail broke many tents and tattered many helmets and wounded many of the horses and broke all the crockery of the army and the gourds which was no small loss in 1993 jimmy owens found crossbow points in blanco canyon in crosby county texas near the town of floydada in floyd county archaeologists subsequently searched the site and found pottery sherds more than forty crossbow points and dozens of horseshoe nails of spanish manufacture plus a mexican-style stone blade this find strengthens the evidence that vzquez de coronado found the teyas in blanco canyon quivira another guide probably pawnee and named ysopete and probably teyas as well told vzquez de coronado that he was going in the wrong direction saying quivira lay to the north by this time vzquez de coronado seems to have lost his confidence that fortune awaited him he sent most of his expedition back to new mexico and continued with only forty spanish soldiers and priests and an unknown number of indian soldiers servants and guides vzquez de coronado thus dedicated himself to a reconnaissance rather than a mission of conquest after more than thirty days journey vzquez de coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before this was the arkansas probably a few miles east of present-day dodge city kansas the spaniards and their indian allies followed the arkansas northeast for three days and found quivirans hunting buffalo the indians greeted the spanish with wonderment and fear but calmed down when one of vzquez de coronados guides addressed them in their own language vzquez de coronado reached quivira itself after a few more days of traveling he found quivira well settled along good river bottoms although without much water and good streams which flow into another vzquez de coronado believed that there were twenty-five settlements in quivira both men and women quivirans were nearly naked vzquez de coronado was impressed with the size of the quivirans and all the other indians he met they were large people of very good build vzquez de coronado spent twenty-five days among the quivirans trying to learn of richer kingdoms just over the horizon he found nothing but straw-thatched villages of up to two hundred houses and fields containing corn beans and squash a copper pendant was the only evidence of wealth he discovered the quivirans were almost certainly the ancestors of the wichita people vzquez de coronado was escorted to the further edge of quivira called tabas where the neighboring land of harahey began he summoned the lord of harahey who with two hundred followers came to meet with the spanish he was disappointed the harahey indians were all naked -- with bows and some sort of things on their heads and their privy parts slightly covered they were not the wealthy people vzquez de coronado sought disappointed he returned to new mexico before leaving quivira vzquez de coronado ordered the turk garroted the turk is regarded as an indian hero in a display at albuquerques indian pueblo cultural center because he led vzquez de coronado onto the great plains and thus relieved the beleaguered pueblos of spanish depredations for at least a few months location of quivira tabas and harahey archaeological evidence suggests that quivira was in central kansas with the western-most village near the small town of lyons on cow creek extending twenty miles east to the little arkansas river and north another twenty miles to the town of lindsborg on a tributary of the smoky hill river tabas was likely on the smoky hill river archaeologists have found numerous 16th-century sites in these areas that probably include some of the settlements visited by vzquez de coronado at harahey was a river with more water and more inhabitants than the other this sounds as if vzquez de coronado may have reached the smoky hill river near salina or abilene it is a larger river than either cow creek or the little arkansas and is located at roughly the 25 league distance from lyons that vzquez de coronado said he traveled in quivira the people of harahey seem caddoan because it was the same sort of a place with settlements like these and of about the same size as quivira they were probably the ancestors of the pawnee expedition end vzquez de coronado returned to the tiguex province in new mexico from quivira and was badly injured in a fall from his horse after the winter was over according to the chronicler castaedaprobably in march 1542 during a long convalescence he and his expeditionaries decided to return to new spain mexico vzquez de coronado and his expedition departed new mexico in early april 1542 leaving behind two friars his expedition had been a failure although he remained governor of nueva galicia until 1544 the expedition forced him into bankruptcy and resulted in charges of war crimes being brought against him and his field master crdenas vzquez de coronado was cleared by his friends on the audiencia but crdenas was convicted in spain of basically the same charges by the council of the indies vzquez de coronado remained in mexico city where he died of an infectious disease on september 22 1554 he was buried under the altar of the church of santo domingo in mexico city vzquez de coronado caused a large loss of life among the puebloans both from the battles he fought with them in the tiguex war and from the demands for food and clothing that he levied on their fragile economies however thirty-nine years later when the spanish again visited the southwestern united states they found little evidence that vzquez de coronado had any lasting cultural influences on the indians except for their surprise at seeing several light-skinned and light-haired puebloans see the chamuscado and rodriguez expedition and antonio de espejo legacy in 1952 the united states established coronado national memorial near sierra vista arizona to commemorate his expedition indiana jones and the last crusade references the cross of coronado according to the film this gold cross discovered in a utah cave system was given to vzquez de coronado by hernn corts in 1521 such an event never happened because vzquez de coronado would have been 11 or 12 years old in 1521 and still living in spain in addition when indy captures the cross from robbers aboard a ship off the coast of portugal the ship can be seen to be named the coronado in 1992 underground found-footage filmmaker craig baldwin made the film o no coronado detailing the expedition of vzquez de coronado through the use of recycled images from westerns conquest films and the lone ranger television series the song hitchin to quivira from independent singer-songwriter tyler jakess 2016 album mojo suicide is based on the story of vzquez de coronados expedition the song coronado and the turk from singer-songwriter steve tilstons 1992 album of moor and mesa is based on the story of vzquez de coronados expedition there is a large hill just northwest of lindsborg kansas that is called coronado heights the former owner of the land built a small castle atop the hill to commemorate vzquez de coronados 1541 visit to the area the castle and the area around it is now a public camping and recreation area the soft sandstone rocks at the peak of the hill are covered in the names of past visitors to the area coronado high schools in lubbock texas el paso texas colorado springs colorado and scottsdale arizona were named for vzquez de coronado because a don is a name for a spanish nobleman the coronado don became the school mascot in scottsdale bernalillo new mexico calls itself the city of coronado because he stayed
