normal human body temperature also known as normothermia or euthermia is the typical temperature range found in humans the normal human body temperature range is typically stated as 365375c 977995f individual body temperature depends upon the age exertion infection sex and reproductive status of the subject the time of day the place in the body at which the measurement is made and the subjects state of consciousness waking sleeping or sedated activity level and emotional state it is typically maintained within this range by thermoregulation methods of measurement taking a persons temperature is an initial part of a full clinical examination there are various types of medical thermometers as well as sites used for measurement including in the rectum rectal temperature in the mouth oral temperature under the arm axillary temperature in the ear tympanic temperature in the nose in the vagina vaginal temperature in the bladder on the skin of the forehead over the temporal artery variations temperature control thermoregulation is part of a homeostatic mechanism that keeps the organism at optimum operating temperature as the temperature affects the rate of chemical reactions in humans the average internal temperature is 370c 986f though it varies among individuals however no person always has exactly the same temperature at every moment of the day temperatures cycle regularly up and down through the day as controlled by the persons circadian rhythm the lowest temperature occurs about two hours before the person normally wakes up additionally temperatures change according to activities and external factors in addition to varying throughout the day normal body temperature may also differ as much as 05c 09f from one day to the next so that the highest or lowest temperatures on one day will not always exactly match the highest or lowest temperatures on the next day normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day consequently each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures the range for normal human body temperatures taken orally is 700230995000000000036805c 700230992777777777798209f this means that any oral temperature between 363 and 373c 973 and 991f is likely to be normal the normal human body temperature is often stated as 365375c 977995f in adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 332382c 9181008f for normal temperatures depending on the gender and location measured reported values vary depending on how it is measured oral under the tongue 700230995000000000036804c 7002309927777777777982072f internal rectal vaginal 370c 986f a rectal or vaginal measurement taken directly inside the body cavity is typically slightly higher than oral measurement and oral measurement is somewhat higher than skin measurement other places such as under the arm or in the ear produce different typical temperatures while some people think of these averages as representing normal or ideal measurements a wide range of temperatures has been found in healthy people the body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 05c 09f with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening as the bodys needs and activities change other circumstances also affect the bodys temperature the core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle the lowest point called the nadir is one of the primary markers for circadian rhythms the body temperature also changes when a person is hungry sleepy sick or cold natural rhythms body temperature normally fluctuates over the day following circadian rhythms with the lowest levels around 4 am and the highest in the late afternoon between 400 and 600pm assuming the person sleeps at night and stays awake during the day therefore an oral temperature of 373c 991f would strictly speaking be a normal healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning an individuals body temperature typically changes by about 05c 09f between its highest and lowest points each day body temperature is sensitive to many hormones so women have a temperature rhythm that varies with the menstrual cycle called a circamensal rhythm a womans basal body temperature rises sharply after ovulation as estrogen production decreases and progesterone increases fertility awareness programs use this change to identify when a woman has ovulated in order to achieve or avoid pregnancy during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle both the lowest and the average temperatures are slightly higher than during other parts of the cycle however the amount that the temperature rises during each day is slightly lower than typical so the highest temperature of the day is not very much higher than usual hormonal contraceptives both suppress the circamensal rhythm and raise the typical body temperature by about 06c 11f temperature also varies with the change of seasons during each year this pattern is called a circannual rhythm studies of seasonal variations have produced inconsistent results people living in different climates may have different seasonal patterns increased physical fitness increases the amount of daily variation in temperature with increased age both average body temperature and the amount of daily variability in the body temperature tend to decrease elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever so even a somewhat elevated temperature can indicate a serious underlying cause in geriatrics measurement methods different methods used for measuring temperature produce different results the temperature reading depends on which part of the body is being measured the typical daytime temperatures among healthy adults are as follows temperature in the anus rectumrectal vagina or in the ear otic is about 375c 995f temperature in the mouth oral is about 368c 982f temperature under the arm axillary is about 365c 977f generally oral rectal gut and core body temperatures although slightly different are well-correlated oral temperatures are influenced by drinking chewing smoking and breathing with the mouth open mouth breathing cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures hot drinks hot food chewing and smoking raise oral temperatures each measurement method also has different normal ranges depending on sex variations due to outside factors many outside factors affect the measured temperature as well normal values are generally given for an otherwise healthy non-fasting adult dressed comfortably indoors in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature 227 to 244c 73 to 76f during the morning but not shortly after arising from sleep furthermore for oral temperatures the subject must not have eaten drunk or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty minutes as the temperature of the food drink or smoke can dramatically affect the reading temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories caloric restriction as for a weight-loss diet decreases overall body temperature drinking alcohol decreases the amount of daily change slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures exercise raises body temperatures in adults a noticeable increase usually requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time children develop higher temperatures with milder activities like playing psychological factors also influence body temperature a very excited person often has an elevated temperature wearing more clothing slows daily temperature change and raises body temperature similarly sleeping with an electric blanket raises the body temperature at night sleep disturbances also affect temperatures normally body temperature drops significantly at a persons normal bedtime and throughout the night short-term sleep deprivation produces a higher temperature at night than normal but long-term sleep deprivation appears to reduce temperatures insomnia and poor sleep quality are associated with smaller and later drops in body temperature similarly waking up unusually early sleeping in jet lag and changes to shift work schedules may affect body temperature concepts fever a temperature setpoint is the level at which the body attempts to maintain its temperature when the setpoint is raised the result is a fever most fevers are caused by infectious disease and can be lowered if desired with antipyretic medications an early morning temperature higher than 372c 990f or a late afternoon temperature higher than 377c 999f is normally considered a fever assuming that the temperature is elevated due to a change in the hypothalamuss setpoint lower thresholds are sometimes appropriate for elderly people the normal daily temperature variation is typically 05c 090f but can be greater among people recovering from a fever an organism at optimum temperature is considered afebrile or apyrexic meaning without fever if temperature is raised but the setpoint is not raised then the result is hyperthermia hyperthermia hyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can dissipate it is usually caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable to deal effectively with the heat causing the body temperature to climb uncontrollably hyperthermia at or above about 40c 104f is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment common symptoms include headache confusion and fatigue if sweating has resulted in dehydration then the affected person may have dry red skin in a medical setting mild hyperthermia is commonly called heat exhaustion or heat prostration severe hyperthermia is called heat stroke heat stroke may come on suddenly but it usually follows the untreated milder stages treatment involves cooling and rehydrating the body fever-reducing drugs are useless for this condition this may be done through moving out of direct sunlight to a cooler and shaded environment drinking water removing clothing that might keep heat close to the body or sitting in front of a fan bathing in tepid or cool water or even just washing the face and other exposed areas of the skin can be helpful with fever the bodys core temperature rises to a higher temperature through the action of the part of the brain that controls the body temperature with hyperthermia the body temperature is raised without the influence of the heat control centers hypothermia in hypothermia body temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions in humans this is usually due to excessive exposure to cold air or water but it can be deliberately induced as a medical treatment symptoms usually appear when the bodys core temperature drops by 12c 1836f below normal temperature basal body temperature basal body temperature is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest usually during sleep it is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature in women temperature differs at various points in the menstrual cycle and this can be used in the long-term to track ovulation both for the purpose of aiding conception or avoiding pregnancy this process is called fertility awareness core temperature core temperature also called core body temperature is the operating temperature of an organism specifically in deep structures of the body such as the liver in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur significant core temperature elevation hyperthermia or depression hypothermia that is prolonged for more than a brief period of time is incompatible with human life temperature examination in the rectum is the traditional gold standard measurement used to estimate core temperature oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouth-breathing rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at the same time ear thermometers measure eardrum temperature using infrared sensors the blood supply to the tympanic membrane is shared with the brain however this method of measuring body temperature is not as accurate as rectal measurement and has a low sensitivity for fevers missing three or four out of every ten fevers in children ear temperature measurement may be acceptable for observing trends in body temperature but is less useful in consistently identifying fevers until recently direct measurement of core body temperature required surgical insertion of a probe so a variety of indirect methods have commonly been used the rectal or vaginal temperature is generally considered to give the most accurate assessment of core body temperature particularly in hypothermia in the early 2000s ingestible thermistors in capsule form were produced allowing the temperature inside the digestive tract to be transmitted to an external receiver one study found that these were comparable in accuracy to rectal temperature measurement temperature variation hot 44c 1112f or more almost certainly death will occur however people have been known to survive up to 465c 1157f 43c 1094f normally death or there may be serious brain damage continuous convulsions and shock cardio-respiratory collapse will likely occur 42c 1076f subject may turn pale or remain flushed and red they may become comatose be in severe delirium vomiting and convulsions can occur blood pressure may be high or low and heart rate will be very fast 41c 1058f medical emergency fainting vomiting severe headache dizziness confusion hallucinations delirium and drowsiness can occur there may also be palpitations and breathlessness 40 c 104 f fainting dehydration weakness vomiting headache breathlessness and dizziness may occur as well as profuse sweating starts to be life-threatening 39c 1022f severe sweating flushed and red fast heart rate and breathlessness there may be exhaustion accompanying this children and people with epilepsy may be very likely to get convulsions at this point 38c 1004f classed as hyperthermia if not caused by a fever feeling hot sweating feeling thirsty feeling very uncomfortable slightly hungry if this is caused by fever there may also be chills normal 365375c 977995f is a typically reported range for normal body temperature cold 36 c 968 f feeling cold mild to moderate shivering body temperature may drop this low during sleep may be a normal body temperature 35c 95f hypothermia is less than 35c 95f intense shivering numbness and bluishgrayness of the skin there is the possibility of heart irritability 34 c 932 f severe shivering loss of movement of fingers blueness and confusion some behavioural changes may take place 33 c 914 f moderate to severe confusion sleepiness depressed reflexes progressive loss of shivering slow heart beat shallow breathing shivering may stop subject may be unresponsive to certain stimuli 32 c 896 f medical emergency hallucinations delirium complete confusion extreme sleepiness that is progressively becoming comatose shivering is absent subject may even think they are hot reflex may be absent or very slight 31 c 878 f comatose very rarely conscious no or slight reflexes very shallow breathing and slow heart rate possibility of serious heart rhythm problems 28 c 824 f severe heart rhythm disturbances are likely and breathing may stop at any time patient may appear to be dead 2426 c 752788 f or less death usually occurs due to irregular heart beat or respiratory arrest however some patients have been known to survive with body temperatures as low as 142c 576f historical understanding in the 19th century most books quoted blood heat as 98 f until a study published the mean but not the variance of a large sample as 3688c 9838f subsequently that mean was widely quoted as 37 c or 984 f until editors realised 37 c is closer to 986 f than 984 f the 37 c value was set by german physician carl reinhold august wunderlich in his 1868 book which put temperature charts into widespread clinical use dictionaries and other sources that quoted these averages did add the word about to show that there is some variance but generally did not state how wide the variance is
