republic of the congo to the west mount kilimanjaro africas highest mountain is in north-eastern tanzania some prehistoric population migrations into tanzania include southern cushitic speakers who moved south from ethiopia eastern cushitic people who moved into tanzania from north of lake turkana about 2000 and 4000 years ago and the southern nilotes including the datoog who originated from the present-day south sudanethiopia border region between 2900 and 2400 years ago these movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the mashariki bantu from west africa in the lake victoria and lake tanganyika areas they subsequently migrated across the rest of tanzania between 2300 and 1700 years ago european colonialism began in mainland tanzania during the late 19th century when germany formed german east africa which gave way to british rule following world war i the mainland was governed as tanganyika with the zanzibar archipelago remaining a separate colonial jurisdiction following their respective independence in 1961 and 1963 the two entities merged in april 1964 to form the united republic of tanzania the united nations estimated tanzanias 2016 population at 5557 million the population is composed of several ethnic linguistic and religious groups the sovereign state of tanzania is a presidential constitutional republic and since 1996 its

are spoken in tanzania making it the most linguistically diverse country in east africa the country does not have a de jure official language although the national language is swahili swahili is used in parliamentary debate in the lower courts and as a medium of instruction in primary school english is used in foreign trade in diplomacy in higher courts and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education although the tanzanian government is planning to discontinue english as a language of instruction altogether approximately 10 percent of tanzanians speak swahili as a first language and up to 90 percent speak it as a second language etymology the name tanzania was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states that unified to create the country tanganyika and zanzibar the name tanganyika is derived from the swahili words tanga sail and nyika uninhabited plain wilderness creating the phrase sail in the wilderness it is sometimes understood as a reference to lake tanganyika the name of zanzibar comes from zenji the name for a local people said to mean black and the arabic word barr which means coast or shore history pre-colonial the indigenous populations of eastern africa are thought to be the linguistically isolated hadza and sandawe hunter-gatherers of tanzania the first wave of migration was by southern cushitic speakers who moved south from ethiopia into tanzania they are ancestral to the iraqw gorowa and burunge based on linguistic evidence there may also have been two movements into tanzania of eastern cushitic people at about 4000 and 2000 years ago originating from north of lake turkana archaeological evidence supports the conclusion that southern nilotes including the datoog moved south from the present-day south sudan ethiopia border region into central northern tanzania between 2900 and 2400 years ago these movements took place at approximately the same time as the settlement of the iron-making mashariki bantu from west africa in the lake victoria and lake tanganyika areas they brought with them the west african planting tradition and the primary staple of yams they subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of tanzania between 2300 and 1700 years ago eastern nilotic peoples including the maasai represent a more recent migration from present-day south sudan within the past 500 to 1500 years the people of tanzania have been associated with the production of iron and steel the pare people were the main producers of highly demanded iron for peoples who occupied the mountain regions of north-eastern tanzania the haya people on the western shores of lake victoria invented a type of high-heat blast furnace which allowed them to forge carbon steel at temperatures exceeding 1820c 3310f more than 1500 years ago travelers and merchants from the persian gulf and india have visited the east african coast since early in the first millennium ad islam was practiced by some on the swahili coast as early as the eighth or ninth century ad colonial claiming the coastal strip omani sultan said bin sultan moved his capital to zanzibar city in 1840 during this time zanzibar became the centre for the arab slave trade between 65 and 90 percent of the arab-swahili population of zanzibar was enslaved one of the most infamous slave traders on the east african coast was tippu tip who was the grandson of an enslaved african the nyamwezi slave traders operated under the leadership of msiri and mirambo according to timothy insoll figures record the exporting of 718000 slaves from the swahili coast during the 19th century and the retention of 769000 on the coast in the 1890s slavery was abolished in the late 19th century germany conquered the regions that are now tanzania minus zanzibar and incorporated them into german east africa gea the supreme council of the 1919 paris peace conference awarded all of gea to britain on 7 may 1919 over the strenuous objections of belgium the british colonial secretary alfred milner and belgiums minister plenipotentiary to the conference pierre ortsfr then negotiated the anglo-belgian agreement of 30 may 1919 where britain ceded the north-western gea provinces of ruanda and urundi to belgium the conferences commission on mandates ratified this agreement on 16 july 1919 the supreme council accepted the agreement on 7 august 1919 on 12 july 1919 the commission on mandates agreed that the small kionga triangle south of the rovuma river would be given to portuguese mozambique with it eventually becoming part of independent mozambique the commission reasoned that germany had virtually forced portugal to cede the triangle in 1894 the treaty of versailles was signed on 28 july 1919 although the treaty did not take effect until 10 january 1920 on that date the gea was transferred officially to britain belgium and portugal also on that date tanganyika became the name of the british territory during world war ii about 100000 people from tanganyika joined the allied forces and were among the 375000 africans who fought with those forces tanganyikans fought in units of the kings african rifles during the east african campaign in somalia and abyssinia against the italians in madagascar against the vichy french during the madagascar campaign and in burma against the japanese during the burma campaign tanganyika was an important source of food during this war and its export income increased greatly compared to the pre-war years of the great depression wartime demand however caused increased commodity prices and massive inflation within the colony in 1954 julius nyerere transformed an organisation into the politically oriented tanganyika african national union tanu tanus main objective was to achieve national sovereignty for tanganyika a campaign to register new members was launched and within a year tanu had become the leading political organisation in the country nyerere became minister of british-administered tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when tanganyika became independent in 1961 post-colonial british rule came to an end on 9 december 1961 but for the first year of independence tanganyika had a governor general who represented the british monarch on 9 december 1962 tanganyika became a democratic republic under an executive president after the zanzibar revolution overthrew the arab dynasty in neighbouring zanzibar which had become independent in 1963 the archipelago merged with mainland tanganyika on 26 april 1964 on 29 october of the same year the country was renamed the united republic of tanzania tan comes from tanganyika and zan from zanzibar the union of the two hitherto separate regions was controversial among many zanzibaris even those sympathetic to the revolution but was accepted by both the nyerere government and the revolutionary government of zanzibar owing to shared political values and goals following tanganyikas independence and unification with zanzibar leading to the state of tanzania president nyerere emphasized a need to construct a national identity for the citizens of the new country to achieve this nyerere provided what is regarded as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in africa with over 130 languages spoken within its territory tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in africa despite this obstacle ethnic divisions remained rare in tanzania when compared to the rest of the continent notably its immediate neighbor kenya furthermore since its independence tanzania has displayed more political stability than most african countries particularly due to nyereres ethnic repression methods in 1967 nyereres first presidency took a turn to the left after the arusha declaration which codified a commitment to socialism as well-as pan-africanism after the declaration banks and many large industries were nationalised tanzania was also aligned with china which from 1970 to 1975 financed and helped build the 1860-kilometre-long 1160mi tazara railway from dar es salaam to zambia nonetheless from the late 1970s tanzanias economy took a turn for the worse in the context of an international economic crisis affecting both developed and developing economies from the mid-1980s the regime financed itself by borrowing from the international monetary fund and underwent some reforms since then tanzanias gross domestic product per capita has grown and poverty has been reduced according to a report by the world bank in 1992

or early 2009 relatively well strong gold prices bolstering the countrys mining industry and tanzanias poor integration into global markets helped to insulate the country from the downturn since the

the national economy has benefited only the very few leaving out the majority of the population tanzanias 2013 global hunger index was worse than any other country in the eac except burundi the proportion of persons who were undernourished in 201012 was also worse than any other eac country except burundi more about tanzania tanzania has made little progress towards reducing extreme hunger and malnutrition the 2010 global hunger index ranks the situation as alarming children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment limited access to farm inputs extension services and credit limited technology as well as trade and marketing support and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources approximately 68 percent of tanzanias 449 million citizens live below the poverty line of 125 a day and 16 percent of children under 5 are malnourished the most prominent challenges tanzania faces in poverty reduction are unsustainable harvesting of its natural resources unchecked cultivation climate change and water- source encroachment according to the united nations development programme undp there are very few resources for tanzanians in terms of credit services infrastructure or availability to improved agricultural technologies which further exacerbates hunger and poverty in the country according to the undp tanzania ranks 159 out of 187 countries in poverty according to the united nations human development index 2014 agriculture the tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture which in 2013 accounted for 245 percent of

electric supply industry in tanzania the country generated 6013 billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity in 2013 a 42 percent increase over the 5771 billion kwh generated in 2012 generation increased by 63 percent between 2005 and 2012 almost 18 percent of the electricity generated in 2012 was lost because of theft and transmission and distribution problems the electrical supply varies particularly when droughts disrupt hydropower electric generation rolling blackouts are implemented as necessary the unreliability of the electrical supply has hindered the development of tanzanian industry in 2013 497 percent of tanzanias electricity generation came from natural gas 289 percent from hydroelectric sources 204 percent from thermal sources and 10 percent from outside the country the government has built a 532 kilometres 331mi gas pipeline from mnazi bay to dar es salaam this pipeline was expected to allow the country to double its electricity generation capacity to 3000 megawatts by 2016 the governments goal is to increase capacity to at least 10000 megawatts by 2025 according to pfc energy 25 to 30 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources have been discovered in tanzania since 2010 bringing the total reserves to over 43 trillion cubic feet by the end of 2013 the value of natural gas actually produced in 2013 was us522 million a 427 percent increase over 2012 commercial production of gas from the songo songo island field in the indian ocean commenced in 2004 thirty years after it was discovered there over 35 billion cubic feet of gas was produced from this field in 2013 with proven probable and possible reserves totalling 11 trillion cubic feet the gas is transported by pipeline to dar es salaam as of 27 august 2014 tanesco owed the operator of this field orca exploration group inc a newer natural gas field in mnazi bay in 2013 produced about one-seventh of the amount produced near songo songo island but has proven probable and possible reserves of 22 trillion cubic feet virtually all of that gas is being used for electricity generation in mtwara the ruvuma and nyuna regions of tanzania have been explored mostly by the discovery company that holds a 75 percent interest aminex and has shown to hold in excess of 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a pipeline connecting offshore natural gas fields to tanzanias commercial capital dar es salaam was completed at the end of april 2015 tourism travel and tourism contributed 175 percent of tanzanias gross domestic product in 2016 and employed 110 percent of the countrys labour force 1189300 jobs in 2013 overall receipts rose from us174 billion in 2004 to us448 billion in 2013 and receipts from international tourists rose from us1255 billion in 2010 to us2

poor condition tanzania has two railway companies tazara which provides service between dar es salaam and kapiri mposhi in a copper-mining district in zambia and tanzania railways limited which connects dar es salaam with central and northern tanzania rail travel in tanzania often entails slow journeys with frequent cancellations or delays and the railways have a deficient safety record in dar es salaam there is a huge project of rapid buses dar rapid transit dart which connects suburbs of dar es salaam city the development of the dart system consists of six phases and is funded by the african development bank the world bank and the government of tanzania the first phase began in april 2012 and it was completed in december 2015 and launched operations in may 2016 tanzania has four international airports along with over 100 small airports or landing strips airport infrastructure tends to be in poor condition airlines in tanzania include air tanzania precision air fastjet coastal

12 percent of tanzanians used the internet as of 2011 though this number is growing rapidly the country has a fibre-optic cable network that replaced unreliable satellite service but internet bandwidth remains very low water supply and sanitation water supply and sanitation in tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water sources in the 2000s especially in urban areas steady access to some form of sanitation around 93 percent since the 1990s intermittent water supplies and generally low quality of service many utilities are barely able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency there are significant regional differences with the best performing utilities being arusha moshi and tanga the government of tanzania has embarked on a major sector reform process since 2002 an ambitious national water sector development strategy that promotes integrated water resources management and the development of urban and rural water supply was adopted in 2006 decentralisation has meant that responsibility for water and sanitation service provision has shifted to local government authorities and is carried out by 20 urban utilities and about 100 district utilities as well as by community owned water supply organisations in rural areas these reforms have been backed by a significant increase of the budget starting in 2006 when the water sector was included among the priority sectors of the national strategy for growth and reduction of poverty the tanzanian water sector remains heavily dependent on external donors with 88 percent of the available funds being provided by external donor organisations results have been mixed for example a report by deutsche gesellschaft fr

entities in tanzania food and nutrition poor nutrition remains a persistent problem within tanzania and varies hugely throughout the countrys regions usaid reports that 16 of children are underweight and 34 experience stunted growth as a result of malnutrition 10 regions house 58 of children suffering from stunted growth while 50 of acutely malnourished children can be found in 5 regions over a

in the prevalence of stunting in this age group rising from 50 in 2005 to 57 in 2010 overall availability of food does not necessarily contribute to overall stunting figures iringa mbeya and rukwa regions where overall availability of food is considered acceptable still experience stunting incidences in excess of 50 in some areas where food shortages are common such as in the tabora and singida regions stunting incidences remain comparatively less than those seen in iringa mbeya and rukwa the tanzania food and nutrition centre attributes these discrepancies to variance in maternal malnutrition poor infant feeding practices hygiene practices and poor healthcare services periods of drought can have significant impacts on the production of crops in tanzania drought in east africa has resulted in massive increases in the prices of food staples such as maize and sorghum crops crucial to the nutrition of the majority of tanzanias population from 2015 to 2017 the price of maize when bought wholesale has more than doubled from 400 shillings per kilogram to 1253 shillings per kilogram respectively tanzania remains heavily agricultural with 80 of the total population engaging

suffering food shortages over a 3-month period compared to 64 of residents in cities this disparity between rural and city nutrition can be attributed to various factors increased nutritional needs due to manual labor more limited access to food as a result of poor infrastructure high-susceptibility to the damaging effects of nature and the agricultural productivity gap the agricultural productivity gap postulates that value added per worker is often much lower within the agricultural sector than that found within non-agricultural sectors furthermore allocation of labor within the
