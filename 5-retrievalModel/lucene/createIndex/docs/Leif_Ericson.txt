leif erikson or leif ericson c 970 c 1020 was a norse explorer from iceland he was the first known european to have set foot on continental north america excluding greenland before christopher columbus according to the sagas of icelanders he established a norse settlement at vinland tentatively identified with the norse lanse aux meadows on the northern tip of newfoundland in modern-day canada later archaeological evidence suggests that vinland may have been the areas around the gulf of st lawrence and that the lanse aux meadows site was a ship repair station leif was the son of erik the red the founder of the first norse settlement in greenland and of thjodhild jhildur both of norwegian origin his place of birth is not known but he is assumed to have been born in iceland which had recently been colonized by norsemen mainly from norway he grew up in the family estate brattahl in the eastern settlement in greenland leif had two known sons thorgils born to noblewoman thorgunna in the hebrides and thorkell who succeeded him as chieftain of the greenland settlement early life leif was the son of erik the red and his wife thjodhild and the grandson of thorvaldr svaldsson and distant relative of naddodd who discovered iceland he was a viking in the early days his year of birth is most often given as c 970 or c 980 though leifs birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas it is likely he was born in iceland where his parents metprobably somewhere on the edge of breiafjrur and possibly at the farm haukadal where thjhilds family is said to have been based leif had two brothers whose names were thorsteinn and thorvaldr and a sister freyds thorvald asvaldsson was banished from norway for manslaughter and went into exile in iceland accompanied by young erik when erik was himself banished from iceland he travelled further west to an area he named greenland where he established the first permanent settlement in 986 tyrker one of eriks thralls had been specially trusted to keep in charge of eriks children as leif later referred to him as his foster father discovering vinland leif and his crew travelled from greenland to norway in 999 ad blown off course to the hebrides and staying for much of the summer he arrived in norway and became a hirdman of king olaf tryggvason he also converted to christianity and was given the mission of introducing the religion to greenland the saga of erik the red and the saga of the greenlanders both thought to have been written around 1200 contain different accounts of the voyages to vinland the only two known strictly historical mentions of vinland are found in the work of adam of bremen c 1075 and in the book of icelanders compiled c 1122 by ari the wise according to the saga of erik the red leif apparently saw vinland for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce christianity to greenland according to a literal interpretation of einar haugens translation of the two sagas in the book voyages to vinland leif was not the first european to discover america he had heard the story of merchant bjarni herjlfsson who claimed to have sighted land to the west of greenland after having been blown off course bjarni reportedly never made landfall there however later when travelling from norway to greenland leif was also blown off course to a land that he did not expect to see where he found self-sown wheat fields and grapevines he next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country and went back to greenland and christianised the people there consequently if this is to be trusted bjarni herjlfsson was the first european to see america beyond greenland and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to europeans to have made landfall there leif then approached bjarni purchased his ship gathered a crew of thirty-five men and mounted an expedition towards the land bjarni had described his father erik was set to join him but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to set sail an incident he interpreted as a bad omen leif followed bjarnis route in reverse and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named helluland flat-rock land possibly baffin island after venturing further by sea he landed the second time in a forested place he named markland forest land possibly labrador finally after two more days at sea he landed in a verdant area with a mild climate and plentiful supplies of salmon as winter approached he decided to encamp there and broke his party into two groups one to remain at camp and the other to explore the country during one of these explorations tyrker discovered that the land was full of vines and grapes leif therefore named the land vinland there he and his crew built a small settlement which was called leifsbudir leifs booths by later visitors from greenland after having wintered over in vinland leif returned to greenland in the spring with a cargo of grapes and timber on the return voyage he rescued an icelandic castaway and his crew earning him the nickname leif the lucky research done in the early 1960s by norwegian explorer helge ingstad and his wife archaeologist anne stine ingstad identified a norse site located at the northern tip of newfoundland it has been suggested that this site known as lanse aux meadows is leifsbir the ingstads demonstrated that norsemen had reached america about 500 years before christopher columbus later archaeological evidence suggests that vinland may have been the areas around the gulf of st lawrence and that the lanse aux meadows site was a ship repair station and waypoint for voyages there that does not necessarily contradict the identification of lanse aux meadows with leifsbir since the two sagas appear to describe vinland as a wider region which included several settlements the saga of erik the red mentions two other settlements in vinland a settlement called straumfjrr which lay beyond kjalarnes promontory and the wonderstrands and one called hp which was located even farther south personal life leif was described as a wise considerate and strong man of striking appearance during his stay in the hebrides he fell in love with a noblewoman thorgunna who gave birth to their son thorgils thorgils was later sent to leif in greenland but he did not become popular after leifs first trip to vinland he returned to the family estate of brattahl in greenland and started preaching christianity to the greenlanders his father erik reacted coldly to the suggestion that he should abandon his religion while his mother thjhildr quickly became a christian and built a church called thjhilds church leif is last mentioned alive in 1019 and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of eirksfjrr to another son thorkell nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagashe probably died in greenland some time between these dates nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of thorkell as chieftain legacy norse and medieval europe leifs successful expedition in vinland encouraged other norsemen to also make the journey the first apparent contact between the norse and the indigenous people who the norse later referred to as skrlingjar was made by his brother thorvald and resulted in hostilities and killing in the end there were no permanent norse settlements in vinland although sporadic voyages at least to markland for forages timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries the casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries or that it was assumed to be public knowledge or both knowledge of the vinland journeys might have spread around medieval europe as writers such as adam of bremen made mention of remote lands to the west it has been suggested that the knowledge of vinland might have been maintained in european seaports in the 15th century and that christopher columbus who claimed in a letter to have visited iceland in 1477 could have heard stories of it travels and commemoration stories of leifs journey to north america had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later nordic americans and nordic immigrants to the united states the first statue of leif by anne whitney was erected in boston in 1887 at the instigation of eben norton horsford who was among those who believed that vinland could have been located on the charles river or cape cod not long after another casting of whitneys statue was erected in milwaukee a statue was also erected in chicago in 1901 having been originally commissioned for the 1893 worlds columbian exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed viking ship from bergen norway another work of art made for the 1893 worlds columbian exposition the painting leiv eiriksson oppdager amerika by christian krohg was in the possession of a leif erikson memorial association in chicago before being given back to the national gallery of norway in 1900 for the centenary of the first official immigration of norwegians to america president calvin coolidge stated at the 1925 minnesota state fair to a crowd of 100000 people that leif had indeed been the first european to discover america further statues of him were erected at the minnesota state capitol in st paul in 1949 near lake superior in duluth in 1956 and in downtown seattle the sagas do not give the exact date of leif eriksons landfall in america they only state that it was in the fall of the year at the suggestion of christian a hoen edgerton wis 9 october was settled upon as that already was a historic date for norwegians in america the ship restaurationen coming from stavanger arrived in new york harbor on 9 october 1825 with its first organized party of norwegian immigrants in 1929 the wisconsin legislature passed a bill to make 9 october leif erikson day in the state the bill was signed by governor walter j kohler sr that may in 1964 the united states congress authorized and requested the president to proclaim 9 october of each year as leif erikson day in fiction leif is the main character in two novels called vinland the good and the 1928 film the viking leif is one of the main characters in makoto yukimuras manga vinland saga see also alonso snchez a spanish navigator who purportedly visited the americas
