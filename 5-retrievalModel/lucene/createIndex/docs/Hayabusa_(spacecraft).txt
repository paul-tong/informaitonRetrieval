hayabusa japanese peregrine falcon was a robotic spacecraft developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa to return a sample of material from a small near-earth asteroid named 25143 itokawa to earth for further analysis hayabusa formerly known as muses-c for mu space engineering spacecraft c was launched on 9 may 2003 and rendezvoused with itokawa in mid-september 2005 after arriving at itokawa hayabusa studied the asteroids shape spin topography colour composition density and history in november 2005 it landed on the asteroid and collected samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material which were returned to earth aboard the spacecraft on 13 june 2010 the spacecraft also carried a detachable minilander minerva which failed to reach the surface mission firsts other spacecraft notably galileo and near shoemaker both launched by nasa had visited asteroids before but the hayabusa mission was the first attempt to return an asteroid sample to earth for analysis in addition hayabusa was the first spacecraft designed to deliberately land on an asteroid and then take off again near shoemaker made a controlled descent to the surface of 433 eros in 2000 but it was not designed as a lander and was eventually deactivated after it arrived technically hayabusa was not designed to land it simply touches the surface with its sample capturing device and then moves away however it was the first craft designed from the outset to make physical contact with the surface of an asteroid junichiro kawaguchi of the institute of space and astronautical science was appointed to be the leader of the mission despite its designers intention of a momentary contact hayabusa did land and sit on the asteroid surface for about 30 minutes see timeline below mission profile the hayabusa spacecraft was launched on 9 may 2003 at 042925 utc on an m-v rocket from the uchinoura space center still called kagoshima space center at that time following launch the spacecrafts name was changed from the original muses-c to hayabusa the japanese word for falcon the spacecrafts xenon ion engines four separate units operating near-continuously for two years slowly moved hayabusa toward a september 2005 rendezvous with itokawa as it arrived the spacecraft did not go into orbit around the asteroid but remained in a station-keeping heliocentric orbit close by hayabusa surveyed the asteroid surface from a distance of about 20km 137mi the gate position after this the spacecraft moved closer to the surface the home position and then approached the asteroid for a series of soft landings and for the collection of samples at a safe site autonomous optical navigation was employed extensively during this period because the long communication delay prohibits earth-based real-time commanding at the second hayabusa touched down with its deployable collection horn the spacecraft was programmed to fire tiny projectiles at the surface and then collect the resulting spray some tiny specks were collected by the spacecraft for analysis back on earth after a few months in proximity to the asteroid the spacecraft was scheduled to fire its engines to begin its cruise back to earth this maneuver was delayed due to problems with attitude control orientation and the thrusters of the craft once it was on its return trajectory the re-entry capsule was released from the main spacecraft three hours before reentry and the capsule coasted on a ballistic trajectory re-entering the earths atmosphere at 1351 13 june 2010 utc it is estimated that the capsule experienced peak deceleration of about 25 g and heating rates approximately 30 times those experienced by the apollo spacecraft it landed via parachute near woomera australia in relation to the mission profile jaxa defined the following success criteria and corresponding scores for major milestones in the mission prior to the launch of the hayabusa spacecraft as it shows the hayabusa spacecraft is a platform for testing new technology and the primary objective of the hayabusa project is the worlds first implementation of microwave discharge ion engines hence operation of ion engines for more than 1000 hours is an achievement that gives a full score of 100 points and the rest of the milestones are a series of worlds first-time experiments built on it minerva mini-lander hayabusa carried a tiny mini-lander weighing only 591g 208oz and approximately 10cm 39in tall by 12cm 47in in diameter named minerva short for micro-nano experimental robot vehicle for the asteroid an error during deployment resulted in the crafts failure this solar-powered vehicle was designed to take advantage of itokawas very low gravity by using an internal flywheel assembly to hop across the surface of the asteroid relaying images from its cameras to hayabusa whenever the two spacecraft were in sight of one another minerva was deployed on 12 november 2005 the lander release command was sent from earth but before the command could arrive hayabusas altimeter measured its distance from itokawa to be 44m 144ft and thus started an automatic altitude keeping sequence as a result when the minerva release command arrived minerva was released while the probe was ascending and at a higher altitude than intended so that it escaped itokawas gravitational pull and tumbled into space had it been successful minerva would have been the first hopping space rover the soviet mission phobos 2 also encountered a malfunction while attempting to deploy a hopping rover scientific and engineering importance of the mission scientists current understanding of asteroids depends greatly on meteorite samples but it is very difficult to match up meteorite samples with the exact asteroids from which they came hayabusa will help solve this problem by bringing back pristine samples from a specific well-characterized asteroid hayabusa bridged the gap between ground observation data of asteroids and laboratory analysis of meteorite and cosmic dust collections also comparing the data from the onboard instruments of the hayabusa with the data from the near shoemaker mission will put the knowledge on a wider level the hayabusa mission has a very deep engineering importance for jaxa too it allowed jaxa to further test its technologies in the fields of ion engines autonomous and optical navigation deep space communication and close movement on objects with low gravity among others second since it was the first-ever preplanned soft contact with the surface of an asteroid the near shoemaker landing on 433 eros was not preplanned it has enormous influence on further asteroid missions changes in mission plan the hayabusa mission profile was modified several times both before and after launch the spacecraft was originally intended to launch in july 2002 to the asteroid 4660 nereus the asteroid 10302 1989 ml was considered as an alternative target however a july 2000 failure of japans m-5 rocket forced a delay in the launch putting both nereus and 1989 ml out of reach as a result the target asteroid was changed to 1998 sf36 which was soon thereafter named for japanese rocket pioneer hideo itokawa hayabusa was to deploy a small rover supplied by nasa and developed by jpl called muses-cn onto the surface of the asteroid but the rover was canceled by nasa in november 2000 due to budget constraints in 2002 launch was postponed from december 2002 to may 2003 to recheck the o-rings of its reaction control system since one of them had been found to be using a different material than specified in 2003 while hayabusa was en route to itokawa the largest solar flare recorded in history damaged the solar cells aboard the spacecraft this reduction in electrical power reduced the efficiency of the ion engines thus delaying the arrival at itokawa from june to september 2005 since orbital mechanics dictated that the spacecraft still had to leave the asteroid by november 2005 the amount of the time it was able to spend at itokawa was greatly reduced and the number of landings on the asteroid was reduced from three to two in 2005 two reaction wheels that govern the attitude movement of hayabusa failed the x-axis wheel failed on july 31 and the y-axis on october 2 after the latter failure the spacecraft was still able to turn on its x and y axes with its thrusters jaxa claimed that since global mapping of itokawa had been completed this was not a major problem but the mission plan was altered the failed reaction wheels were manufactured by ithaco space systems inc new york which was later acquired by goodrich company the 4 november 2005 rehearsal landing on itokawa failed and was rescheduled the original decision to sample two different sites on the asteroid was changed when one of the sites woomera desert was found to be too rocky for a safe landing the 12 november 2005 release of the minerva miniprobe ended in failure mission timeline up to the launch the asteroid exploration mission by the institute of space and astronautical science isas originated in 19861987 when the scientists investigated the feasibility of a sample return mission to anteros and concluded that the technology was not yet developed between 1987 and 1994 joint isas nasa group studied several missions an asteroid rendezvous mission later became near and a comet sample return mission later became stardust in 1995 isas selected the asteroid sampling as an engineering demonstration mission muses-c nereus as the first choice of target 1989 ml as the secondary choice and muses-c project started in fiscal year 1996 in early development phase nereus was considered out of reach and 1989 ml became the primary target july 2000 failure of m-v forced a delay in the launch from july 2002 to novemberdecember putting both nereus and 1989 ml out of reach as a result the target asteroid was changed to 1998 sf36 in 2002 launch was postponed from december 2002 to may 2003 to recheck o-rings of reaction control system since one of it was found using different material than specification on may 9 2003 042925 utc muses-c was launched by m-v rocket and the probe was named hayabusa cruising ion thruster checkout started on 27 may 2003 full power operation started on 25 june asteroids are named by their discoverer isas asked linear the discoverer of 1998 sf36 to offer the name after hideo itokawa and on 6 august minor planet circular reported that the target asteroid 1998 sf36 was named itokawa in october 2003 isas and two other national aerospace agencies were merged to form jaxa on 31 march 2004 ion thruster operation was stopped to prepare for the earth swing-by last maneuver operation before swing-by on 12 may on 19 may hayabusa performed earth swing-by on 27 may ion thruster operation was started again on february 18 2005 hayabusa passed aphelion at 17 au on 31 july the x-axis reaction wheel failed on 14 august hayabusas first image of itokawa was released the picture was taken by the star tracker and shows a point of light believed to be the asteroid moving across the starfield other images were taken from 22 to 24 august on 28 august hayabusa was switched over from the ion engines to the bi-propellant thrusters for orbital maneuvering from 4 september hayabusas cameras were able to confirm itokawas elongated shape from 11 september individual hills were discerned on the asteroid on 12 september hayabusa was 20km 12mi from itokawa and jaxa scientists announced that hayabusa had officially arrived in proximity of itokawa on 15 september 2005 a colour image of the asteroid was released which is however grey in colouring on 4 october jaxa announced that the spacecraft had successfully moved to its home position 7km from itokawa closeup pictures were released it was also announced that the spacecrafts second reaction wheel governing the y-axis had failed and that the craft was now being pointed by its rotation thrusters on november 3 hayabusa took station 30km from itokawa it then began its descent planned to include delivery of a target marker and release of the minerva minilander the descent went well initially and navigation images with wide-angle cameras were obtained however at 0150utc 1050 am jst on 4 november it was announced that due to a detection of an anomalous signal at the gonogo decision the descent including release of minerva and the target marker had been canceled the project manager junichiro kawaguchi explained that the optical navigation system was not tracking the asteroid very well probably caused by the complex shape of itokawa a few days delay was required to evaluate the situation and reschedule on 7 november hayabusa was 75km from itokawa on november 9 hayabusa performed a descent to 70 m to test the landing navigation and the laser altimeter after that hayabusa backed off to a higher position then descended again to 500 m and released one of the target markers into space to test the crafts ability to track it this was confirmed from analysis of the closeup images the woomera desert site point b was found to be too rocky to be suitable for landing the muses sea site point a was selected as the landing site for both first and if possible second landings on 12 november hayabusa closed in to 55 m from the asteroids surface minerva was released but due to an error failed to reach the surface on 19 november hayabusa landed on the asteroid there was considerable confusion during and after the maneuver about precisely what had happened because the high-gain antenna of the probe could not be used during final phase of touch-down as well as the blackout during handover of ground station antenna from dsn to usuda station it was initially reported that hayabusa had stopped at approximately 10 meters from the surface hovering for 30 minutes for unknown reasons ground control sent a command to abort and ascend and by the time the communication was regained the probe had moved 100km away from the asteroid the probe had entered into a safe mode slowly spinning to stabilize attitude control however after regaining control and communication with the probe the data from the landing attempt were downloaded and analyzed and on 23 november jaxa announced that the probe had indeed landed on the asteroids surface unfortunately the sampling sequence was not triggered since a sensor detected an obstacle during descent the probe tried to abort the landing but since its orientation was not appropriate for ascent it chose instead a safe descent mode this mode did not permit a sample to be taken but there is a high probability that some dust may have whirled up into the sampling horn when it touched the asteroid so the sample canister currently attached to the sampling horn was sealed on november 25 a second touchdown attempt was performed it was initially thought that this time the sampling device was activated however later analysis decided that this was probably another failure and that no pellets were fired due to a leak in the thruster system the probe was put in a safe hold mode on 30 november jaxa announced that control and communication with hayabusa had been restored but a problem remained with the crafts reaction control system perhaps involving a frozen pipe mission control was working to resolve the problem before the crafts upcoming launch window for return to earth on december 6 hayabusa was 550km from itokawa jaxa held a press conference about the situation so far on 27 november the probe experienced a power outage when trying to reorient the spacecraft probably due to a fuel leakage on 2 december an attitude orientation correction was attempted but the thruster did not generate enough force on 3 december the probes z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the sun direction and increasing on 4 december as an emergency measure xenon propellant from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin and it was confirmed successful on 5 december attitude control was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna telemetry was obtained and analyzed as the result of telemetry analysis it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 november due to the power outage the telemetry log data was faulty on 8 december a sudden orientation change was observed and communication with hayabusa was lost it was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10cc of leaked fuel this forced a wait of a month or two for hayabusa to stabilize by conversion of precession to pure rotation after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the sun and earth within a specific angular range the probability of achieving this was estimated at 60 by december 2006 70 by spring 2007 recovery and return to earth on 7 march 2006 jaxa announced that communication with hayabusa had been recovered in the following stages on 23 january the beacon signal from the probe was detected on 26 january the probe responded to commands from ground control by changing the beacon signal on 6 february an ejection of xenon propellant was commanded for attitude control to improve communication the spin axis change rate was about two degrees per day on 25 february telemetry data was obtained through the low-gain antenna on 4 march telemetry data was obtained through the medium-gain antenna on 6 march hayabusas position was established at about 13000km ahead of itokawa in its orbit with a relative speed of 3 m per second on 1 june hayabusa project manager junichiro kawaguchi reported that they confirmed two out of four ion engines were working normally which would have been sufficient for the return journey on 30 january 2007 jaxa reported that 7 out of 11 batteries were working and the return capsule was sealed on 25 april jaxa reported that hayabusa started the return journey on 29 august it was announced that ion engine c onboard hayabusa in addition to b and d had been successfully re-ignited on 29 october jaxa reported that the first phase of trajectory maneuver operation had finished and the spacecraft was now put in a spin-stabilized state on 4 february 2009 jaxa reported success in reignition of the ion engines and starting the second phase of the trajectory correction maneuver to return to earth on 4 november 2009 the ion engine d automatically stopped working due to an anomaly from degradation on 19 november 2009 jaxa announced that they managed to combine the ion generator of ion engine b and the neutralizer of ion engine a it was suboptimal but expected to be sufficient to generate the necessary delta-v out of 2200 ms delta-v necessary to return to the earth about 2000 ms had been performed already and about 200 ms were still necessary on 5 march 2010 hayabusa was on a trajectory that would have passed within the lunar orbit ion engine operation was suspended to measure the precise trajectory in preparation to perform trajectory correction maneuver 1 to the earth-rim trajectory on 27 march 0617 utc hayabusa was on a trajectory which would pass 20000km from earth center completing the orbit transfer operation from itokawa to earth by 6 april the first stage of trajectory correction maneuver tcm-0 which led to a rough earth rim trajectory was completed it was planned to be 60 days until reentry by 4 may the probe completed its tcm-1 maneuver to align precisely to the earth rim trajectory on 22 may tcm-2 started continued for about 925 hours and finished on 26 may it was followed by tcm-3 from 3 through 5 june to change the trajectory from the earth rim to woomera south australia tcm-4 was performed on june 9 for about 25 hours for a precision descent to woomera prohibited area the reentry capsule was released at 1051 utc on 13 june reentry and capsule retrieval the reentry capsule and the spacecraft reentered earths atmosphere on 13 june 2010 at 1351 utc 2321 local the heat-shielded capsule made a parachute landing in the south australian outback while the spacecraft broke up and incinerated in a large fireball an international team of scientists observed the 122kms entry of the capsule from 119km 39000ft on board nasas dc-8 airborne laboratory using a wide array of imaging and spectrographic cameras to measure the physical conditions during atmospheric reentry in a mission led by nasas ames research center with peter jenniskens of the seti institute as the project scientist since the reaction control system no longer functioned the 510 kilograms 1120lb space probe re-entered the earths atmosphere similar to the approach of an asteroid along with the sample re-entry capsule and as mission scientists expected the majority of the spacecraft disintegrated upon entry the return capsule was predicted to land in a 20 km by 200 km area in the woomera prohibited area south australia four ground teams surrounded this area and located the re-entry capsule by optical observation and a radio beacon then a team on board a helicopter was dispatched they located the capsule and recorded its position with gps the capsule was successfully retrieved at 0708 utc 1638 local of 14 june 2010 the two parts of the heat shield which were jettisoned during the descent were also found after confirming that the explosive devices used for parachute deployment were safe the capsule was packed inside a double layer of plastic bags filled with pure nitrogen gas to reduce the risk of contamination the soil at the landing site was also sampled for reference in case of contamination then the capsule was put inside a cargo container which had air suspension to keep the capsule below 15 g shock during transportation the capsule and its heat shield parts were transported to japan by a chartered plane and arrived at the curation facility at the jaxaisas sagamihara campus on june 18 a tokyo metropolitan government adviser and former lieutenant general toshiyuki shikata claimed that part of the rationale for the reentry and landing part of the mission was to demonstrate that japans ballistic missile capability is credible scientific study of samples before the capsule was extracted from the protecting plastic bag it was inspected using x-ray ct to determine its condition then the sample canister was extracted from the reentry capsule the surface of the canister was cleaned using pure nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide it was then placed in the canister opening device the internal pressure of the canister was determined by a slight deformation of the canister as the pressure of the environment nitrogen gas in the clean chamber was varied the nitrogen gas pressure was then adjusted to match the internal canister pressure to prevent the escape of any gas from the sample upon the opening of the canister confirmation of asteroid particles on 16 november 2010 jaxa confirmed that most of the particles found in one of two compartments inside the hayabusa sample return capsule came from itokawa analysis with a scanning electron microscope identified about 1500 grains as rocky particles according to the jaxa press release after further studying the analysis results and comparison of mineral compositions most of them were judged to be of extraterrestrial origin and definitely from the asteroid itokawa according to japanese scientists the composition of hayabusas samples was more similar to meteorites than known rocks from earth their size is mostly less than 10 micrometers the material matches chemical maps of itokawa from hayabusas remote sensing instruments the researchers found concentrations of olivine and pyroxene in the hayabusa samples further study of the samples had to wait until 2011 because researchers were still developing special handling procedures to avoid contaminating the particles during the next phase of research in 2013 jaxa announced that 1500 extraterrestrial grains had been recovered comprising the minerals olivine pyroxene plagioclase and iron sulphide the grains were about 10 micrometers in size jaxa performed detailed analyses of the samples by splitting particles and examining their crystal structure at spring-8 results the august 26 2011 issue of science devoted six articles to findings based on dust collected by hayabusa scientists analysis of the dust from itokawa suggested that it had probably originally been part of a larger asteroid dust collected from the asteroid surface was believed to have been exposed there for about eight million years dust from itokawa was found to be identical to material that makes up meteorites itokawa is an s-type asteroid whose composition matches that of an ll chondrite in popular culture in japan rival film companies announced the production of three different feature length theatrical films based on the story of hayabusa one of which hayabusa harukanaru kikan starred ken watanabe the lego construction toy company released a model of hayabusa through their cuusoo website many references to hayabusa appear in the japanese series kamen rider fourze a space-themed tokusatsu series a music video titled hayabusa named after the unmanned spacecraft was made using the vocaloid hatsune miku the music and lyrics were composed by sho following the sample return in 2010 hayabusa-tan an anthropomorphised figure in anime style was released by the company aoshima hayabusa also appears as a
