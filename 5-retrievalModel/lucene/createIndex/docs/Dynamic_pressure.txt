dynamic pressure sometimes called velocity pressure is the increase in a moving fluids pressure over its static value due to motion in incompressible fluid dynamics it is indicated as q displaystyle q or q defined by where using si units physical meaning dynamic pressure is the kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid particle dynamic pressure is in fact one of the terms of bernoullis equation which can be derived from the conservation of energy for a fluid in motion in simplified cases the dynamic pressure is equal to the difference between the stagnation pressure and the static pressure another important aspect of dynamic pressure is that as dimensional analysis shows the aerodynamic stress ie stress within a structure subject to aerodynamic forces experienced by an aircraft travelling at speed v displaystyle v is proportional to the air density and square of v displaystyle v ie proportional to q displaystyle q therefore by looking at the variation of q displaystyle q during flight it is possible to determine how the stress will vary and in particular when it will reach its maximum value the point of maximum aerodynamic load is often referred to as max q and it is a critical parameter in many applications such as launch vehicles uses the dynamic pressure along with the static pressure and the pressure due to elevation is used in bernoullis principle as an energy balance on a closed system the three terms are used to define the state of a closed system of an incompressible constant-density fluid when the dynamic pressure is divided by the product of fluid density and acceleration due to gravity g the result is called velocity head which is used in head equations like the one used for pressure head and hydraulic head in a venturi flow meter the differential pressure head can be used to calculate the differential velocity head which are equivalent in the adjacent picture an alternative to velocity head is dynamic head compressible flow many authors define dynamic pressure only for incompressible flows for compressible flows these authors use the concept of impact pressure however the definition of dynamic pressure can be extended to include compressible flows if the fluid in question can be considered an ideal gas which is generally the case for air the dynamic pressure can be expressed as a function of fluid pressure and mach number by applying the ideal gas law the definition of the speed of sound a displaystyle a and of mach number m displaystyle m and also q 1 2 u 2 displaystyle qtfrac 12rho u2 dynamic pressure can be rewritten as where using si units see also pressure pressure head hydraulic head total dynamic head drag lift and pitching moment coefficients derivations of bernoulli equation l j clancy 1975 aerodynamics pitman publishing limited london isbn0-273-01120-0 houghton el and carpenter pw 1993 aerodynamics for engineering students butterworth and heinemann oxford uk isbn0-340-54847-9 liepmann hans wolfgang roshko anatol 1993 elements of gas dynamics courier dover publications isbn0-486-41963-0 notes definition of dynamic pressure on eric weissteins world of science
