california has a very diverse economy 58 of the states economy is centered on finance government real estate services technology and professional scientific and technical business services although it accounts for only 15 of the states economy californias agriculture industry has the highest output of any us state california is bordered by oregon to the north nevada and arizona to the east and the mexican state of baja california to the south with the coast being on the west the states diverse geography ranges from the pacific coast in the west to the sierra nevada mountain range in the east and from the redwooddouglas fir forests in the northwest to the mojave desert in the southeast the central valley a major agricultural area dominates the states center although california is well-known for its warm mediterranean climate the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior as well as snowy alpine in the mountains over time drought and wildfires have become more pervasive features what is now california was first settled by various native californian tribes before being explored by a number of european expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries the spanish empire then claimed it as part of alta california in their new spain colony the area became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexicanamerican war the western portion of alta california then was organized and admitted as the 31st state on september 9 1850 the california gold rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom etymology the word california originally referred to the baja california peninsula of mexico it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current united states states of california nevada and utah and parts of arizona new mexico texas and wyoming spanish explorer francisco de ulloas when exploring the western coast of north america when initially surveying the baja california peninsula thought that it was an island rather than a peninsula the conventional wisdom that california was an island with maps drawn to reflect this belief lasted as late as the 18th century the name likely derived from the mythical island california in the fictional story of queen calafia as recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandin by garci rodrguez de montalvo this work was the fifth in a popular spanish chivalric romance series that began with amadis de gaula queen calafias kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls inhabited by beautiful black women who wore gold armor and lived like amazons as well as griffins and other strange beasts in the fictional paradise the ruler queen calafia fought alongside muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader the caliph its possible the name california was meant to imply the island was a caliphate know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of amazons they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks shortened forms of the states name include ca cal calif and us-ca history the first inhabitants settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10000 years california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-columbian north america various estimates of the native population range from 100000 to 300000 the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource-rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the chumash pomo and salinan trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups colonial and spanish periods the first european to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition led by spanish captain juan rodrguez cabrillo in 1542 some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579 spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 1565 the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587 when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay sebastin vizcano explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain despite the on-the-ground explorations of california in the 16th century rodrguezs idea of california as an island persisted that depiction appeared on many european maps well into the 18th century after the portol expedition of 176970 spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta upper california beginning in san diego during the same period spanish military forces built several forts presidios and three small towns pueblos the san francisco mission grew into the city of san francisco and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose several other smaller cities and towns also sprang up surrounding the various spanish missions and pueblos which remain to this day the spanish colonization began decimating the natives through epidemics of various diseases for which the indigenous peoples had no natural immunity such as measles and diphtheria the establishment of the spanish systems of government and social structure which the spanish settlers had brought with them also technologically and culturally overwhelmed the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples during this same period russian ships also explored along the california coast and in 1812 established a trading post at fort ross russias early 19th-century coastal settlements in california were positioned just north of the northernmost edge of the area of spanish settlement in san francisco bay and were the southernmost russian settlements in north america the russian settlements associated with fort ross were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay california under mexican rule in 1821 the mexican war of independence gave mexico including california independence from spain for the next 25 years alta california remained as a remote sparsely populated northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of mexico after mexican independence from spain the missions which controlled most of the best land in the state were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the mexican government the governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence these huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california the ranchos developed under ownership by californios hispanic residents native born in california who traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants beef didnt become a commodity until the 1849 gold rush from the 1820s trappers and settlers from the united states and the future canada arrived in northern california these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail california trail oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding california the early government of the newly independent mexico was highly unstable and in a reflection of this from 1831 onwards california also experienced a series of armed disputes both between regional areas and also revolts against the central mexican government during this tumultuous political period juan bautista alvarado was able to secure the governorship from 1836 - 1842 the military action which first brought alvarado to power had momentarily declared california to be an independent state and had been aided by american and british residents of california including isaac graham in 1840 one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the graham affair one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts he determined that california should become part of the united states marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the california climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as marshs route his letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to california he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california thereby paving the way to californias ultimate acquisition by the united states california republic and american invasion in 1846 a group of american settlers in and around sonoma rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt afterwards rebels raised the bear flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words california republic at sonoma the republics only president was william b ide who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt this revolt by american settlers served as a prelude to the later american military invasion of california and was closely coordinated with nearby american military commanders the california republic was short lived the same year marked the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war 184648 when commodore john d sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states northern california capitulated in less than a month to the united states forces after a series of defensive battles in southern california the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13 1847 securing american control in california early american statehood period following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo february 2 1848 that ended the war the westernmost portion of the annexed mexican territory of alta california soon became the american state of california and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new american territories of arizona nevada colorado and utah the lightly populated and arid lower region of old baja california remained as a part of mexico in 1846 the total settler population of the western part of the old alta california had been estimated to be no more than 8000 plus about 100000 native americans down from about 300000 before hispanic settlement in 1769 in 1848 only one week before the official american annexation of the area gold was discovered in california this being an event which was to forever alter both the states demographics and its finances soon afterward a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands the population burgeoned with united states citizens europeans chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush by the time of californias application to the us congress for statehood in 1850 the settler population of california had multiplied to 100000 by 1854 over 300000 settlers had come between 1847 and 1870 the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 150000 california was suddenly no longer a sparsely populated backwater but seemingly overnight it had grown into a major us population center the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule had been located in monterey from 1777 until 1845 pio pico last mexican governor of alta california had briefly moved the capital to los angeles in 1845 the united states consulate had also been located in monterey under consul thomas o larkin in 1849 a state constitutional convention was first held in monterey among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital the first full legislative sessions were held in san jose 18501851 subsequent locations included vallejo 18521853 and nearby benicia 18531854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well the capital has been located in sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento once the states constitutional convention had finalized its state constitution it applied to the us congress for admission to statehood on september 9 1850 as part of the compromise of 1850 california was officially admitted into the united states as an undivided free state its status as a free state prevented the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast which was a foremost concern for the pre-civil war us congress within the state of california sep 9 remains as an annually celebrated legal holiday known as california admission day during the american civil war 18611865 california was able to send gold shipments eastwards to washington in support of the union cause however due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-south sympathizers within the state the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the union war effort still several smaller military units within the union army were unofficially associated with the state of california such as the california 100 company due to a majority of their members being from california at the time of californias admission into the union travel between california and the rest of the continental united states had been a time consuming and dangerous feat nineteen years afterwards in 1869 shortly after the conclusion of the civil war a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869 california was then easy to reach much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in southern california and the foundation was laid for the states prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere indigenous peoples under early american administration under earlier spanish and mexican rule californias original native population had precipitously declined above all from eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of california had not yet developed a natural immunity under its new american administration californias harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve as in other american states many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming american settlers such as miners ranchers and farmers although california had entered the american union as a free state the loitering or orphaned indians were de facto enslaved by their new anglo-american masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians there were also massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed between 1850 and 1860 the california state government paid around 15million dollars some 250000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations in later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them as a result the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants several scholars and native american activists including benjamin madley and ed castillo have described the actions of the california government as a genocide 20th century migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66 in the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the union in 1940 the census bureau reported californias population as 60 hispanic 24 asian and 895 non-hispanic white to meet the populations needs major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts the oroville and shasta dams and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education meanwhile attracted to the mild mediterranean climate cheap land and the states wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s california manufactured 87 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking third behind new york and michigan among the 48 states california however easily ranked first in production of military ships during the war transport cargo merchant ships such as liberty ships victory ships and warships at drydock facilities in san diego los angeles and the san francisco bay area after world war ii californias economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries whose size decreased following the end of the cold war stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as silicon valley as a result of these efforts california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the united states center of agricultural production just before the dot com bust california had the fifth-largest economy in the world among nations yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in southern california california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants in most years this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus during the 20th century two great disasters happened in california the 1906 san francisco earthquake and 1928 st francis dam flood remain the deadliest in us history geography california is the 3rd largest state in the united states in area after alaska and texas california is often geographically bisected into two regions southern california comprising the 10 southernmost counties and northern california comprising the 48 northernmost counties it is bordered by oregon to the north nevada to the east and northeast arizona to the southeast the pacific ocean to the west and it shares an international border with the mexican state of baja california to the south with which it makes up part of the californias region of north america alongside baja california sur in the middle of the state lies the california central valley bounded by the sierra nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the cascade range to the north and by the tehachapi mountains in the south the central valley is californias productive agricultural heartland divided in two by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta the northern portion the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river while the southern portion the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them with dredging the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports the sacramento-san joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost two-thirds of the states population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley suisun bay lies at the confluence of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers the water is drained by the carquinez strait which flows into san pablo bay a northern extension of san francisco bay which then connects to the pacific ocean via the golden gate strait the channel islands are located off the southern coast while the farallon islands lie west of san francisco the sierra nevada spanish for snowy range includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states mount whitney at 14505 feet 4421m the range embraces yosemite valley famous for its glacially carved domes and sequoia national park home to the giant sequoia trees the largest living organisms on earth and the deep freshwater lake lake tahoe the largest lake in the state by volume to the east of the sierra nevada are owens valley and mono lake an essential migratory bird habitat in the western part of the state is clear lake the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in california although lake tahoe is larger it is divided by the californianevada border the sierra nevada falls to arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including palisade glacier the southernmost glacier in the united states about 45 percent of the states total surface area is covered by forests and californias diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state california contains more forestland than any other state except alaska many of the trees in the california white mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over 5000 years old in the south is a large inland salt lake the salton sea the south-central desert is called the mojave to the northeast of the mojave lies death valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in north america the badwater basin at 279 feet 85m the horizontal distance from the bottom of death valley to the top of mount whitney is less than 90 miles 140km indeed almost all of southeastern california is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer the southeastern border of california with arizona is entirely formed by the colorado river from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water a majority of californias cities are located in either the san francisco bay area or the sacramento metropolitan area in northern california or the los angeles area the riverside-san bernardino-inland empire or the san diego metropolitan area in southern california the los angeles area the bay area and the san diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the california coast as part of the ring of fire california is subject to tsunamis floods droughts santa ana winds wildfires landslides on steep terrain and has several volcanoes it has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state in particular the san andreas fault about 37000 earthquakes are recorded each year but most are too small to be felt climate although most of the state has a mediterranean climate due to the states large size the climate ranges from polar to subtropical the cool california current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers the maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of los angeles and san francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean northern parts of the state have more rain than the south californias mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes northwestern california has a temperate climate and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast the high mountains including the sierra nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer californias mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters death valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is considered the hottest location in the world the highest temperature in the world 134f 567c was recorded there on july 10 1913 the lowest temperature in california was 45f 43c in 1937 in boca the table below lists average temperatures for january and august in a selection of places throughout the state some highly populated and some not this includes the relatively cool summers of the humboldt bay region around eureka the extreme heat of death valley and the mountain climate of mammoth in the sierra nevadas ecology california is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities california is part of the nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions californias large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the catalina ironwood lyonothamnus floribundus many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the california lilac ceanothus many california endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat flora and fauna california boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees californias native grasses are perennial plants after european contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of european annual grasses and in modern times californias hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer because california has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower sonoran desert upper sonoran foothill regions and some coastal lands transition coastal areas and moist northeastern counties and the canadian hudsonian and arctic zones comprising the states highest elevations plant life in the dry climate of the lower sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde the joshua tree is found in the mojave desert flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the central valley the upper sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants nemophila mint phacelia viola and the california poppy eschscholzia californica the state flower also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world the transition zone includes most of californias forests with the redwood sequoia sempervirens and the big tree or giant sequoia sequoiadendron giganteum among the oldest living things on earth some are said to have lived at least 4000 years tanbark oak california laurel sugar pine madrona broad-leaved maple and douglas-fir also grow here forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies the high elevations of the canadian zone allow the jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique sierra puffball is also found here right below the timberline in the hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow at about 10500 feet 3200m begins the arctic zone a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers including sierra primrose yellow columbine alpine buttercup and alpine shooting star common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus acacia pepper tree geranium and scotch broom the species that are federally classified as

either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the us fish wildlife service also as of the same year 178 species of california plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list rivers the most prominent river system within california is formed by the sacramento river and san joaquin river which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the sierra nevada and respectively drain the north and south halves of the central valley the two rivers join in the sacramentosan joaquin river delta flowing into the pacific ocean through san francisco bay many major tributaries feed into the sacramentosan joaquin system including the pit river feather river and tuolumne river the klamath and trinity rivers drain a large area in far northwestern california the eel river and salinas river each drain portions of the california coast north and south of san francisco bay respectively the mojave river is the primary watercourse in the mojave desert and the santa ana river drains much of the transverse ranges as it bisects southern california the colorado river forms the states southeast border with arizona most of californias major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects the central valley project providing water for agriculture in the central valley and the california state water project diverting water from northern to southern california the states coasts rivers and other bodies of water are regulated by the california coastal commission regions demography population the united states census bureau estimates that the population of california was 39557045 on july 1 2018 a 618 increase since the 2010 united states census the population is projected to reach 40 million by 2020 and 50million by 2060 between 2000 and 2009 there was a natural increase of 3090016 5058440 births minus 2179958 deaths during this time period international migration produced a net increase of 1816633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1509708 resulting in a net in-migration of 306925 people the state of californias own statistics show a population of 38292687 for january 1 2009 however according to the manhattan institute for policy research since 1990 almost 34million californians have moved to other states with most leaving to texas nevada and arizona within the western hemisphere california is the second most populous sub-national administrative entity behind the state of so paulo in brazil and third most populous sub-national entity of any kind outside asia in which wider category it also ranks behind england in the united kingdom which has no administrative functions californias population is greater than that of all but 34 countries of the world the greater los angeles area is the 2nd-largest metropolitan area in the united states after the new york metropolitan area while los angeles with nearly half the population of new york city is the second-largest city in the united states conversely san francisco with nearly one-quarter the population density of manhattan is the most densely populated city in california and one of the most densely populated cities in the united states also los angeles county has held the title of most populous united states county for decades and it alone is more populous than 42 united states states including los angeles four of the top 15 most populous cities in the us are in california los angeles 2nd san diego 8th san jose 10th and san francisco 13th the center of population of california is located in the town of buttonwillow kern county cities and towns the state has 482 incorporated cities and towns of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns under california law the terms city and town are explicitly interchangeable the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be city of name or town of name sacramento became californias first incorporated city on february 27 1850 san jose san diego and benicia tied for californias second incorporated city each receiving incorporation on march 27 1850 jurupa valley became the states most recent and 482nd incorporated municipality on july 1 2011 the majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas the los angeles metropolitan area the san francisco bay area the riverside-san bernardino area the san diego metropolitan area or the sacramento metropolitan area migration starting in the year 2010 for the first time since the california gold rush california-born residents make up the majority of the states population along with the rest of the united states californias immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s-early 2010s immigration from latin american countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from asia in total for 2011 there were 277304 immigrants 57 came from asian countries vs 22 from latin american countries net immigration from mexico previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zeroless than zero since more mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating as a result it is projected that hispanic citizens will constitute 49 of the population by 2060 instead of the previously projected 2050 due primarily to domestic births the states population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers the number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the mexican border in the southwest decreased from a high of 11million in 2005 to 367000 in 2011 despite these recent trends illegal aliens constituted an estimated 73 percent of the states population the third highest

infrastructure energy because it is the most populous state in the united states california is one of the countrys largest users of energy however because of its high energy rates conservation mandates mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any united states state due to the high electricity demand california imports more electricity than any other state primarily hydroelectric power from states in the pacific northwest via path 15 and path 66 and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert southwest via path 46 as a result of the states strong environmental movement california has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the united states with a target for california to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020 currently several solar power plants such as the solar energy generating systems facility are located in the mojave desert californias wind farms include altamont pass san gorgonio pass and tehachapi pass several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power it would be possible to convert the total supply to 100 renewable energy

urban sectors especially in the arid southern portion of the state the states widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists the california water wars a conflict between los angeles and the owens valley over water rights is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies former california governor arnold schwarzenegger said weve been in crisis for quite some time because were now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s so it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban and everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water government and politics state

of any state californias military forces consist of the army and air national guard the naval and state military reserve militia and the california cadet corps ideology california has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter in socio-cultural mores and national politics californians are perceived as more liberal than other americans especially those who live in the inland states as of the 2016 presidential election california was the 2nd most democratic state behind hawaii according to the cook political report california contains 5 of the 15 most democratic congressional districts in the united states among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting california was the second state to recall their state

cell research and proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the states primary election process california has also experienced disputes over water rights and a tax revolt culminating with the passage of proposition 13 in 1978 limiting state property taxes the states trend towards the democratic party and away from the republican party can be seen in state elections from 1899 to 1939 california had republican governors since 1990 california has generally elected democratic candidates to federal state and local offices including current governor gavin newsom however the state has elected republican governors though many of its republican governors such as arnold schwarzenegger tend to be considered moderate republicans and more centrist than the national party the democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature there are 60 democrats and 20 republicans in the assembly and 29 democrats and 11 republicans in the senate the trend towards the democratic party is most obvious in presidential elections from 1960 to 1988 california was a republican stronghold with the party carrying the states electoral votes in every election except for 1964 california republicans richard nixon and ronald reagan were elected as the 37th and the 40th us presidents respectively however democrats have won all of californias electoral votes since 1992 in the united states house the democrats held a 3419 edge in the ca delegation of the 110th united states congress in 2007 as the result of gerrymandering the districts in california were usually dominated by one or the other party and few districts were considered competitive in 2008 californians passed proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and congress after the 2012 elections when the new system took effect democrats gained 4 seats and held a 3815 majority in the delegation following the 2018 midterm house elections democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in california leaving republicans with 7 in general democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the los angeles metropolitan area and the san francisco bay area republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state orange county had remained largely republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections in which a majority of the countys votes were cast for democratic candidates one study ranked berkeley oakland inglewood and san francisco in the top 20 most liberal american cities and bakersfield orange
