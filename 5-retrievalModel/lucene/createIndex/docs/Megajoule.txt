the joule dul symbol j is a derived unit of energy in the international system of units it is equal to the energy transferred to or work done on an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre 1 newton metre or nm it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule 18181889 in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units where kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second n is the newton pa is the pascal w is the watt c is the coulomb and v is the volt one joule can also be defined as the work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt or one coulomb-volt cv this relationship can be used to define the volt the work required to produce one watt of power for one second or one watt-second ws compare kilowatt-hour 36 megajoules this relationship can be used to define the watt usage this si unit is named after james prescott joule as with every international system of units si unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case j however when an si unit is spelled out in english it is treated as a common noun and should always begin with a lower case letter jouleexcept in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case exception of newton metre in mechanics the concept of force in some direction has a close analog in the concept of torque about some angle a result of this similarity is that the si unit for torque is the newton metre which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule but they are not interchangeable the cgpm has given the unit of energy the name joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence it is simply the newton metre nm a compound name derived from its constituent parts the use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications the distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement by contrast torque is a vector the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector torque and energy are related to one another by the equation where e is energy is the vector magnitude of torque and is the angle swept in radians since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions practical examples one joule in everyday life represents approximately the energy required to lift a medium-sized tomato up 1 metre 3ft 3in assume the tomato has a mass of approximately 100 grams 35oz the energy released when that same tomato falls back down one metre the energy required to accelerate a 1kg mass at 1 ms through a distance of 1m the heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 024c the typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 160 s approximately 17ms the kinetic energy of a 50kg human moving very slowly 02ms or 072kmh the kinetic energy of a 56g tennis ball moving at 6ms 22kmh the kinetic energy of an object with mass 1kg moving at 214ms the amount of electricity required to light a 1w led for 1s since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kwh kilowatt-hour a kwh is thus 1000w 3600s 36mj megajoules multiples

watt sustained for one second while the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning there are some contexts in which the term watt-second is used instead of joule photography in photography the unit for flashes is the watt-second a flash can be rated in watt-seconds eg 300ws or in joules different names for the same thing but historically the term watt-second has been used and continues to be used an on-camera flash using a 1000 microfarad capacitor at 300 volts would be 45 watt-seconds studio flashes using larger capacitors and higher voltages are in the 2002000 watt-second range the energy rating a flash is given is not a reliable benchmark for its light output because there are numerous factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency for example the construction of the tube will affect the efficiency and the use of reflectors and filters will change the usable light output towards the subject some companies specify their products in true watt-seconds and some specify their products in nominal watt-seconds see also fluence watt second notes and references
