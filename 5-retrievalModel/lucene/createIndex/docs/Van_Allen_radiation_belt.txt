a van allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles most of which originate from the solar wind that are captured by and held around a planet by that planets magnetic field earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created the discovery of the belts is credited to james van allen and as a result earths belts are known as the van allen belts earths two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 58000km 400 to 36040mi above the surface in which region radiation levels vary most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays by trapping the solar wind the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction the belts are located in the inner region of earths magnetosphere the belts trap energetic electrons and protons other nuclei such as alpha particles are less prevalent the belts endanger satellites which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone in 2013 nasa reported that the van allen probes had discovered a transient third radiation belt which was observed for four weeks until it was destroyed by a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the sun discovery kristian birkeland carl strmer and nicholas christofilos had investigated the possibility of trapped charged particles before the space age explorer 1 and explorer 3 confirmed the existence of the belt in early 1958 under james van allen at the university of iowa the trapped radiation was first mapped by explorer 4 pioneer 3 and luna 1 the term van allen belts refers specifically to the radiation belts surrounding earth however similar radiation belts have been discovered around other planets the sun does not support long-term radiation belts as it lacks a stable global dipole field the earths atmosphere limits the belts particles to regions above 2001000km 124620 miles while the belts do not extend past 8 earth radii re the belts are confined to a volume which extends about 65 on either side of the celestial equator research the nasa van allen probes mission aims at understanding to the point of predictability how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind nasa institute for advanced conceptsfunded studies have proposed magnetic scoops to collect antimatter that naturally occurs in the van allen belts of earth although only about 10 micrograms of antiprotons are estimated to exist in the entire belt the van allen probes mission successfully launched on august 30 2012 the primary mission is scheduled to last two years with expendables expected to last four nasas goddard space flight center manages the living with a star program of which the van allen probes is a project along with solar dynamics observatory sdo the applied physics laboratory is responsible for the implementation and instrument management for the van allen probes radiation belts exist around other planets and moons in the solar system that have magnetic fields powerful enough to sustain them to date most of these radiation belts have been poorly mapped the voyager program namely voyager 2 only nominally confirmed the existence of similar belts around uranus and neptune inner belt the inner van allen belt extends typically from an altitude of 02 to 2 earth radii l values of 1 to 3 or 1000km 620mi to 6000km 3700mi above the earth in certain cases when solar activity is stronger or in geographical areas such as the south atlantic anomaly the inner boundary may decline to roughly 200 kilometers above the earths surface the inner belt contains high concentrations of electrons in the range of hundreds of kev and energetic protons with energies exceeding 100mev trapped by the strong relative to the outer belts magnetic fields in the region it is believed that proton energies exceeding 50mev in the lower belts at lower altitudes are the result of the beta decay of neutrons created by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei of the upper atmosphere the source of lower energy protons is believed to be proton diffusion due to changes in the magnetic field during geomagnetic storms due to the slight offset of the belts from earths geometric center the inner van allen belt makes its closest approach to the surface at the south atlantic anomaly on march 2014 a pattern resembling zebra stripes was observed in the radiation belts by the radiation belt storm probes ion composition experiment rbspice onboard van allen probes the reason reported was that due to the tilt in earths magnetic field axis the planets rotation generated an oscillating weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt it was later demonstrated that the zebra stripes were in fact an imprint of ionospheric winds on radiation belts outer belt the outer belt consists mainly of high energy 0110mev electrons trapped by the earths magnetosphere it is more variable than the inner belt as it is more easily influenced by solar activity it is almost toroidal in shape beginning at an altitude of three and extending to ten earth radii re 13000 to 60000 kilometres 8100 to 37300mi above the earths surface its greatest intensity is usually around 45 re the outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by the inward radial diffusion and local acceleration due to transfer of energy from whistler-mode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons radiation belt electrons are also constantly removed by collisions with earths atmosphere losses to the magnetopause and their outward radial diffusion the gyroradii of energetic protons would be large enough to bring them into contact with the earths atmosphere within this belt the electrons have a high flux and at the outer edge close to the magnetopause where geomagnetic field lines open into the geomagnetic tail the flux of energetic electrons can drop to the low interplanetary levels within about 100km 62mi a decrease by a factor of 1000 in 2014 it was discovered that the inner edge of the outer belt is characterized by a very sharp transition below which highly relativistic electrons 5mev cannot penetrate the reason for this shield-like behavior is not well understood the trapped particle population of the outer belt is varied containing electrons and various ions most of the ions are in the form of energetic protons but a certain percentage are alpha particles and o oxygen ions similar to those in the ionosphere but are much more energetic this mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source the outer belt is larger than the inner belt and its particle population fluctuates widely energetic radiation particle fluxes can increase and decrease dramatically in response to geomagnetic storms which are themselves triggered by magnetic field and plasma disturbances produced by the sun the increases are due to storm-related injections and acceleration of particles from the tail of the magnetosphere on february 28 2013 a third radiation belt consisting of high-energy ultrarelativistic charged particles was reported to be discovered in a news conference by nasas van allen probe team it was stated that this third belt is a product of coronal mass ejection from the sun it has been represented as a separate creation which splits the outer belt like a knife on its outer side and exists separately as a storage container of particles for a months time before merging once again with the outer belt the unusual stability of this third transient belt has been explained as due to a trapping by the earths magnetic field of ultrarelativistic particles as they are lost from the second traditional outer belt while the outer zone which forms and disappears over a day is highly variable due to interactions with the atmosphere the ultrarelativistic particles of the third belt are thought to not scatter into the atmosphere as they are too energetic to interact with atmospheric waves at low latitudes this absence of scattering and the trapping allows them to persist for a long time finally only being destroyed by an unusual event such as the shock wave from the sun flux values in the belts at a given point the flux of particles of a given energy decreases sharply with energy at the magnetic equator electrons of energies exceeding 500kev resp 5mev have omnidirectional fluxes ranging from 1210 resp 3710 up to 9410 resp 210 particles per square centimeter per second the proton belts contain protons with kinetic energies ranging from about 100kev which can penetrate 06m of lead to over 400mev which can penetrate 143mm of lead most published flux values for the inner and outer belts may not show the maximum probable flux densities that are possible in the belts there is a reason for this discrepancy the flux density and the location of the peak flux is variable depending primarily on solar activity and the number of spacecraft with instruments observing the belt in real time has been limited the earth has not experienced a solar storm of carrington event intensity and duration while spacecraft with the proper instruments have been available to observe the event regardless of the differences of the flux levels in the inner and outer van allen belts the beta radiation levels would be dangerous to humans if they were exposed for an extended period of time the apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts bypassing inner belts completely flux values normal solar conditions ap8 min omnidirectional

omnidirectional proton flux 400 mev antimatter confinement in 2011 a study confirmed earlier speculation that the van allen belt could confine antiparticles the pamela experiment detected orders of magnitude higher levels of antiprotons than are expected from normal particle decays while passing through the south atlantic anomaly this suggests the van allen belts confine a significant flux of antiprotons produced by the interaction of the earths upper atmosphere with cosmic rays the energy of the antiprotons has been measured in the range from 60750mev research funded by the nasa institute for advanced concepts concluded that harnessing these antiprotons for spacecraft propulsion would be feasible researchers believed that this approach would have advantages over antiproton generation at cern because collecting the particles in situ eliminates transportation losses and costs jupiter and saturn are also possible sources but the earth belt is the most productive jupiter is less productive than might be expected due to magnetic shielding from cosmic rays of much of its atmosphere implications for space travel spacecraft travelling beyond low earth orbit enter the zone of radiation of the van allen belts beyond the belts they face additional hazards from cosmic rays and solar particle events a region between the inner and outer van allen belts lies at two to four earth radii and is sometimes referred to as the safe zone solar cells integrated circuits and sensors can be damaged by radiation geomagnetic storms occasionally damage electronic components on spacecraft miniaturization and digitization of electronics and logic circuits have made satellites more vulnerable to radiation as the total electric charge in these circuits is now small enough so as to be comparable with the charge of incoming ions electronics on satellites must be hardened against radiation to operate reliably the hubble space telescope among other satellites often has its sensors turned off when passing through regions of intense radiation a satellite shielded by 3mm of aluminium in an elliptic orbit 200 by 20000 miles 320 by 32190km passing the radiation belts will receive about 2500 rem 25sv per year for comparison a full-body dose of 5 sv is deadly almost all radiation will be received while passing the inner belt the apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the van allen belts which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners the astronauts had low exposure in the van allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely passing through the thinner areas of the outer belts astronauts overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside earths magnetic field the total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 016 and 114 rads 16and114mgy much less than the standard of 5 rem 50msv per year set by the united states atomic energy commission for people who work with radioactivity causes it is generally understood that the inner and outer van allen belts result from different processes the inner belt consisting mainly of energetic protons is the product of the decay of so-called albedo neutrons which are themselves the result of cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere the outer belt consists mainly of electrons they are injected from the geomagnetic tail following geomagnetic storms and are subsequently energized through wave-particle interactions in the inner belt particles that originate from the sun are trapped in the earths magnetic field particles spiral along the magnetic lines of flux as they move longitudinally along those lines as particles move toward the poles the magnetic field line density increases and their longitudinal velocity is slowed and can be reversed reflecting the particle and causing them to bounce back and forth between the earths poles in addition to the spiral about and motion along the flux lines the electrons move slowly in an eastward direction while the ions move westward a gap between the inner and outer van allen belts sometimes called safe zone or safe slot is caused by the very low frequency vlf waves which scatter particles in pitch angle which results in the gain of particles to the atmosphere solar outbursts can pump particles into the gap but they drain again in a matter of days the radio waves were originally thought to be generated by turbulence in the radiation belts but recent work by james l green of the goddard space flight center comparing maps of lightning activity collected by the microlab 1 spacecraft with data on radio waves in the radiation-belt gap from the image spacecraft suggests that they are actually generated by lightning within earths atmosphere the radio waves that generate strike the ionosphere at the correct angle to pass through only at high latitudes where the lower ends of the gap approach the upper atmosphere these results are still under scientific debate proposed removal high voltage orbiting long tether or hivolt is a concept proposed by russian physicist v v danilov and further refined by robert p hoyt and robert l forward for draining and removing the radiation fields of the van allen radiation belts that surround the earth a proposed configuration consists of a system of five 100km long conducting tethers deployed from satellites and charged to a large voltage this would cause charged particles that encounter the tethers to have their pitch angle changed thus over time dissolving the inner belts hoyt and forwards company tethers unlimited performed a preliminary analysis simulation in 2011 and produced a chart depicting a theoretical radiation flux reduction to less than 1 of current levels within two months for the inner belts that threaten leo objects see also dipole model of the
