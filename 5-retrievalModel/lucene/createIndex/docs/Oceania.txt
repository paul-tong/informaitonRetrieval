oceania uk osini oi- -en- us oini listen -n- is a geographic region comprising australasia melanesia micronesia and polynesia spanning the eastern and western hemispheres oceania covers an area of 8525989 square kilometres 3291903sqmi and has a population of 40 million situated in the southeast of the asia-pacific region oceania when compared to continental regions is the smallest in land area and the second smallest in population after antarctica the islands at the geographic extremes of oceania are the bonin islands a politically integral part of japan hawaii a state of the united states clipperton island a possession of france the juan fernndez islands belonging to chile and the campbell islands belonging to new zealand oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of australia and new zealand which rank high in quality of life and human development index to the much less developed economies that belong to countries such as kiribati and tuvalu while also including medium-sized economies of pacific islands such as palau fiji and tonga the largest and most populous country in oceania is australia with sydney being the largest city of both oceania and australia the first settlers of australia new guinea and the large islands just to the east arrived between 50000 and 30000 years ago oceania was first explored by europeans from the 16th century onward portuguese navigators between 1512 and 1526 reached the tanimbar islands some of the caroline islands and west papua new guinea on his first voyage in the 18th century james cook who later arrived at the highly developed hawaiian islands went to tahiti and followed the east coast of australia for the first time the pacific front saw major action during the second world war mainly between allied powers the united states and australia and axis power japan the arrival of european settlers in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of oceania in more contemporary times there has been increasing discussion on national flags and a desire by some oceanians to display their distinguishable and individualistic identity the rock art of australian aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world puncak jaya in papua is often considered the highest peak in oceania most oceanian countries have a parliamentary representative democratic multi-party system with tourism being a large source of income for the pacific islands nations definitions the geographer conrad malte-brun coined the french term ocanie c 1812 ocanie derives from the latin word oceanus and this from the greek word keans ocean natives and inhabitants of this region are called oceanians or oceanicans the term oceania is used because unlike the other continental groupings it is the ocean that links the parts of the region together biogeographically oceania serves as a synonym for the australasian ecozone and the pacific ecozone melanesia polynesia and micronesia with new zealand forming the south-western corner of the polynesian triangle note that new zealand may also be considered part of australasia despite traditionally forming a part of polynesia as an ecozone oceania includes all of micronesia fiji and all of polynesia except new zealand new zealand along with new guinea and nearby islands part of the philippine islands australia solomon islands vanuatu and new caledonia constitute the separate australasian ecozone in the geopolitical conception used by the united nations by the international olympic committee and by many atlases oceania includes australia and the nations of the pacific from papua new guinea east but not indonesian new guinea history australia indigenous australians are the original inhabitants of the australian continent and nearby islands who migrated from africa to asia around 70000 years ago and arrived in australia around 50000 years ago they are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of africa although they likely migrated to australia through southeast asia they are not demonstrably related to any known asian or polynesian population there is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between australians in the far north and the austronesian peoples of modern-day new guinea and the islands but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage they reached tasmania approximately 40000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last ice age it is believed that the first early human migration to australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the sahul continent connected to the island of new guinea via a land bridge the torres strait islanders are indigenous to the torres strait islands which are at the northernmost tip of queensland near papua new guinea the earliest definite human remains found in australia are that of mungo man which have been dated at about 40000 years old melanesia the original inhabitants of the group of islands now named melanesia were likely the ancestors of the present-day papuan-speaking people migrating from south-east asia they appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the solomon islands archipelago including makira and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east particularly along the north coast of new guinea and in the islands north and east of new guinea the austronesian people who had migrated into the area somewhat more than 3000 years ago came into contact with these pre-existing populations of papuan-speaking peoples in the late 20th century some scholars theorized a long period of interaction which resulted in many complex changes in genetics languages and culture among the peoples micronesia micronesia began to be settled several millennia ago although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers there are numerous difficulties with conducting archaeological excavations in the islands due to their size settlement patterns and storm damage as a result much evidence is based on linguistic analysis the earliest archaeological traces of civilization have been found on the island of saipan dated to 1500 bc or slightly before the ancestors of the micronesians settled there over 4000 years ago a decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on yap and pohnpei the prehistories of many micronesian islands such as yap are not known very well the first people of the northern mariana islands navigated to the islands at some period between 4000 bc to 2000 bc from south-east asia they became known as the chamorros and spoke an austronesian language called chamorro the ancient chamorro left a number of megalithic ruins including latte stone the refaluwasch or carolinian people came to the marianas in the 1800s from the caroline islands micronesian colonists gradually settled the marshall islands during the 2nd millennium bc with inter-island navigation made possible using traditional stick charts polynesia the polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating austronesian people and tracing polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the malay archipelago and ultimately in taiwan between about 3000 and 1000 bc speakers of austronesian languages began spreading from taiwan into island south-east asia as tribes whose natives were thought to have arrived through south china about 8000 years ago to the edges of western micronesia and on into melanesia in the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty it is thought that by roughly 1400 bc lapita peoples so-named after their pottery tradition appeared in the bismarck archipelago of north-west melanesia easter islanders claimed that a chief hotu matua arrived on the island in one or two large canoes with his wife and extended family they are believed to have been polynesian published literature suggests the island was settled around ad 300400 or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in hawaii around 1200 tahitian explorers found and began settling the area this date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities moreover a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was settled as recently as 1200 european exploration from 1527 to 1595 a number of other large spanish expeditions crossed the pacific ocean leading to the discovery of the marshall islands and palau in the north pacific as well as tuvalu the marquesas the solomon islands archipelago the cook islands and the admiralty islands in the south pacific in the quest for terra australis spanish explorations in the 17th century such as the expedition led by the portuguese navigator pedro fernandes de queirs discovered the pitcairn and vanuatu archipelagos and sailed the torres strait between australia and new guinea named after navigator lus vaz de torres willem janszoon made the first completely documented european landing in australia 1606 in cape york peninsula abel janszoon tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the australian continental coast and discovered van diemens land now tasmania new zealand in 1642 and fiji islands he was the first known european explorer to reach these islands on 23 april 1770 british explorer james cook made his first recorded direct observation of indigenous australians at brush island near bawley point on 29 april cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the kurnell peninsula it is here that james cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the gweagal his expedition became the first recorded europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline of australia colonization in 1789 the mutiny on the bounty against william bligh led to several of the mutineers escaping the royal navy and settling on pitcairn islands which later became a british colony britain also established colonies in australia in 1788 new zealand in 1840 and fiji in 1872 with much of oceania becoming part of the british empire the gilbert islands now known as kiribati and the ellice islands now known as tuvalu came under britains sphere of influence in the late 19th century french catholic missionaries arrived on tahiti in 1834 their expulsion in 1836 caused france to send a gunboat in 1838 in 1842 tahiti and tahuata were declared a french protectorate to allow catholic missionaries to work undisturbed the capital of papeet was founded in 1843 on 24 september 1853 under orders from napoleon iii admiral febvrier despointes took formal possession of new caledonia and port-de-france nouma was founded 25 june 1854 the spanish explorer alonso de salazar landed in the marshall islands in 1529 they were named by krusenstern after english explorer john marshall who visited them together with thomas gilbert in 1788 en route from botany bay to canton two ships of the first fleet in 1905 the british government transferred some administrative responsibility over south-east new guinea to australia which renamed the area territory of papua and in 1906 transferred all remaining responsibility to australia the marshall islands were claimed by spain in 1874 germany established colonies in new guinea in 1884 and samoa in 1900 the united states also expanded into the pacific beginning with baker island and howland island in 1857 and with hawaii becoming a us territory in 1898 disagreements between the us germany and uk over samoa led to the tripartite convention of 1899 modern history one of the first land offensives in oceania was the occupation of german samoa in august 1914 by new zealand forces the campaign to take samoa ended without bloodshed after over 1000 new zealanders landed on the german colony australian forces attacked german new guinea in september 1914 a company of australians and a british warship besieged the germans and their colonial subjects ending with a german surrender the attack on pearl harbor by the japanese imperial general headquarters was a surprise military strike conducted by the imperial japanese navy against the united states naval base at pearl harbor hawaii on the morning of 7 december 1941 the attack led to the united states entry into world war ii the japanese subsequently invaded new guinea solomon islands and other pacific islands the japanese were turned back at the battle of the coral sea and the kokoda track campaign before they were finally defeated in 1945 some of the most prominent oceanic battlegrounds were the battle of bita paka the solomon islands campaign the air raids on darwin the kokada track and the borneo campaign the united states fought the battle of guam from july 21 to august 10 1944 to recapture the island from japanese military occupation australia and new zealand became dominions in the 20th century adopting the statute of westminster act in 1942 and 1947 respectively in 1946 polynesians were granted french citizenship and the islands status was changed to an overseas territory the islands name was changed in 1957 to polynsie franaise french polynesia hawaii became a us state in 1959 fiji and tonga became independent in 1970 on 1 may 1979 in recognition of the evolving political status of the marshall islands the united states recognized the constitution of the marshall islands and the establishment of the government of the republic of the marshall islands the south pacific forum was founded in 1971 which became the pacific islands forum in 2000 geography oceania was originally conceived as the lands of the pacific ocean stretching from the strait of malacca to the coast of the americas it comprised four regions polynesia micronesia malaysia now called the malay archipelago and melanesia today parts of three geological continents are included in the term oceania eurasia australia and zealandia as well the non-continental volcanic islands of the philippines wallacea and the open pacific oceania extends to new guinea in the west the bonin islands in the northwest the hawaiian islands in the northeast rapa nui and sala y gmez island in the east and macquarie island in the south not included are the pacific islands of taiwan the ryukyu islands the japanese archipelago and the maluku islands all on the margins of asia and the aleutian islands of north america in its periphery oceania sprawls 28 degrees north to the bonin islands in the northern hemisphere and 55 degrees south to macquarie island in the southern hemisphere oceanian islands are of four basic types continental islands high islands coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms high islands are of volcanic origin and many contain active volcanoes among these are bougainville hawaii and solomon islands oceania is one of eight terrestrial ecozones which constitute the major ecological regions of the planet related to these concepts are near oceania that part of western island melanesia which has been inhabited for tens of millennia and remote oceania which is more recently settled although the majority of the oceanian islands lie in the south pacific a few of them are not restricted to the pacific ocean kangaroo island and ashmore and cartier islands for instance are situated in the southern ocean and indian ocean respectively and tasmanias west coast faces the southern ocean the coral reefs of the south pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the oceans surface one of the most dramatic is the great barrier reef off northeastern australia with chains of reef patches a second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands examples include banaba formerly ocean island and makatea in the tuamotu group of french polynesia regions micronesia which lies north of the equator and west of the international date line includes the mariana islands in the northwest the caroline islands in the center the marshall islands to the west and the islands of kiribati in the southeast melanesia to the southwest includes new guinea the worlds second largest island after greenland and by far the largest of the pacific islands the other main melanesian groups from north to south are the bismarck archipelago the solomon islands archipelago santa cruz vanuatu fiji and new caledonia polynesia stretching from hawaii in the north to new zealand in the south also encompasses tuvalu tokelau samoa tonga and the kermadec islands to the west the cook islands society islands and austral islands in the center and the marquesas islands tuamotu mangareva islands and easter island to the east australasia comprises australia new zealand the island of new guinea and neighbouring islands in the pacific ocean most of australasia lies on the southern portion of the indo-australian plate flanked by the indian ocean to the west and the southern ocean to the south the bulk of australasia sits on the indo-australian plate together with india geology the pacific plate which makes up most of oceania is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the pacific ocean at 103million square kilometres 40000000sqmi it is the largest tectonic plate the plate contains an interior hot spot forming the hawaiian islands it is almost entirely oceanic crust the oldest member disappearing by way of the plate tectonics cycle is early-cretaceous 145 to 137 million years ago australia being part of the indo-australian plate is the lowest flattest and oldest landmass on earth and it has had a relatively stable geological history geological forces such as tectonic uplift of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in australias early history when it was still a part of gondwana australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and therefore currently has no active volcanism the geology of new zealand is noted for its volcanic activity earthquakes and geothermal areas because of its position on the boundary of the australian plate and pacific plates much of the basement rock of new zealand was once part of the super-continent of gondwana along with south america africa madagascar india antarctica and australia the rocks that now form the continent of zealandia were nestled between eastern australia and western antarctica the australia-new zealand continental fragment of gondwana split from the rest of gondwana in the late cretaceous time 9590 ma by 75 ma zealandia was essentially separate from australia and antarctica although only shallow seas might have separated zealandia and australia in the north the tasman sea and part of zealandia then locked together with australia to form the australian plate 40 ma and a new plate boundary was created between the australian plate and pacific plate most islands in the pacific are high islands volcanic islands such as easter island american samoa and fiji among others having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore the northwestern hawaiian islands were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago as shield volcanoes over the same volcanic hotspot that formed the emperor seamounts to the north and the main hawaiian islands to the south hawaiis tallest mountain mauna kea is 13796ft 4205m above mean sea level flora the most diverse country of oceania when it comes to the environment is australia with tropical rainforests in the north-east mountain ranges in the south-east south-west and east and dry desert in the centre desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land the coastal uplands and a belt of brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland the northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested cape york peninsula prominent features of the australian flora are adaptations to aridity and fire which include scleromorphy and serotiny these adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families proteaceae banksia myrtaceae eucalyptus gum trees and fabaceae acacia wattle the flora of fiji solomon islands vanuatu and new caledonia is tropical dry forest with tropical vegetation that includes palm trees premna protrusa psydrax odorata gyrocarpus americanus and derris trifoliata new zealands landscape ranges from the fjord-like sounds of the southwest to the tropical beaches of the far north south island is dominated by the southern alps there are 18 peaks of more than 3000 metres 9800ft in the south island all summits over 2900 m are within the southern alps a chain that forms the backbone of the south island the highest peak of which is aorakimount cook at 3754 metres 12316ft earthquakes are common though usually not severe averaging 3000 per year there is a wide variety of native trees adapted to all the various micro-climates in new zealand in hawaii one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct the two species of brighamia b rockii and b insignis are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3000-foot 910m cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas fauna the aptly-named pacific kingfisher is found in the pacific islands as is the red-vented bulbul polynesian starling brown goshawkpacific swallow and the cardinal myzomela among others birds breeding on pitcairn include the fairy tern common noddy and red-tailed tropicbird the pitcairn reed warbler endemic to pitcairn island was added to the endangered species list in 2008 native to hawaii is the hawaiian crow which has been extinct in the wild since 2002 the brown tree snake is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea guam and solomon islands native to australia new guinea and proximate islands are birds of paradise honeyeaters australasian treecreeper australasian robin kingfishers butcherbirds and bowerbirds a unique feature of australias fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals and dominance of the marsupials a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch including the macropods possums and dasyuromorphs the passerines of australia also known as songbirds or perching birds include wrens the magpie group thornbills corvids pardalotes lyrebirds predominant bird species in the country include the australian magpie australian raven the pied currawong crested pigeons and the laughing kookaburra the koala emu platypus and kangaroo are national animals of australia and the tasmanian devil is also one of the well-known animals in the country the goanna is a predatory lizard native to the australian mainland the birds of new zealand evolved into an avifauna that included a large number of endemic species as an island archipelago new zealand accumulated bird diversity and when captain james cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening the mix includes species with unusual biology such as the kakapo which is the worlds only flightless nocturnal lek breeding parrot but also many species that are similar to neighboring land areas some of the more well known and distinctive bird species in new zealand are the kiwi kea takahe kakapo mohua tui and the bellbird the tuatara is a notable reptile endemic to new zealand climate the pacific islands are ruled by a tropical rainforest and tropical savanna climate in the tropical and subtropical pacific the el nio southern oscillation enso affects weather conditions in the tropical western pacific the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the asian landmass november is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active to the southwest of the region in the australian landmass the climate is mostly desert or semi-arid with the southern coastal corners having a temperate climate such as oceanic and humid subtropical climate in the east coast and mediterranean climate in the west the northern parts of the country have a tropical climate snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast in the states of victoria new south wales tasmania and in the australian capital territory most regions of new zealand belong to the temperate zone with a maritime climate kppen climate classification cfb characterised by four distinct seasons conditions vary from extremely wet on the west coast of the south island to almost semi-arid in central otago and subtropical in northland snow falls in new zealands south island and at higher altitudes in the north island it is extremely rare at sea level in the north island hawaii although being in the tropics experiences many different climates depending on latitude and its geography the island of hawaii for example hosts 4 out of 5 in total climate groups on a surface as small as 4028 square miles 10430km according to the kppen climate types tropical arid temperate and polar the hawaiian islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months october to april a few islands in the northwest such as guam are susceptible to typhoons in the wet season the highest recorded temperature in oceania occurred in oodnadatta south australia 2 january 1960 where the temperature reached 507c 1233f the lowest temperature ever recorded in oceania was 256c 141f at ranfurly in otago in 1903 with a more recent temperature of 216c 69f recorded in 1995 in nearby ophir pohnpei of the senyavin islands in micronesia is the wettest settlement in oceania and one of the wettest places on earth with annual recorded rainfall exceeding 7600 millimetres 300in each year in certain mountainous locations the big bog on the island of maui is the wettest place receiving an average 4044 inches 10271mm each year australia australia hawaii hawaii

table below shows the subregions and countries of geopolitical oceania the countries and territories in this table are categorised according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the united nations the information shown follows sources in cross-referenced articles where sources differ provisos have been clearly indicated these territories and regions are subject to various additional categorisations depending on the source and purpose of each description religion the predominant religion in oceania is christianity 73 a 2011 survey found that 92 in melanesia 93 in micronesia and 96 in polynesia described themselves as christians traditional religions are often animist and prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in spirits masalai in tok pisin representing natural forces in the 2013 census 48 of new zealanders affiliated themselves with christianity and 42 declared no religion in the 2016 census 52 of the australian population declared some variety of christianity and 30 stated no religion in recent australian and new zealand censuses large proportions of the population say they belong to no religion which includes atheism agnosticism deism secular humanism and rationalism in tonga everyday life is heavily influenced by polynesian traditions and especially by the christian faith the ahmadiyya mosque in marshall islands is the only mosque in micronesia another one in tuvalu belongs to the same sect the bah house of worship in tiapapata samoa is one of seven designations administered in the bah faith other religions in the region include islam buddhism and hinduism which are prominent minority religions in australia and new zealand judaism sikhism and jainism are also present sir isaac isaacs was the first australian born governor general of australia and was the first jewish vice-regal representative in the british empire prince philip movement is followed around yaohnanen village on the southern island of tanna in vanuatu languages native languages of oceania fall into three major geographic groups the large austronesian language family with such languages as malay indonesian and polynesian languages such as maori and hawaiian the aboriginal australian languages including the large pamanyungan family the papuan languages of new guinea and neighbouring islands including the large transnew guinea family colonial languages include english in australia new zealand hawaii and many other territories french in new caledonia and french polynesia japanese in the bonin islands spanish on easter island there are also creoles formed from the interaction of malay or the colonial languages with indigenous languages such as tok pisin bislama chavacano various malay trade and creole languages hawaiian pidgin norfuk and pitkern contact between austronesian and papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as maisin immigrants brought their own languages to the region such as mandarin italian arabic polish hindi german spanish korean cantonese and greek among others namely in australia and new zealand or fiji hindi in fiji immigration the most multicultural areas in oceania which have a high degree of immigration are australia new zealand and hawaii since 1945 more than 7 million people have settled in australia from the late 1970s there was a significant increase in immigration from asian and other non-european countries making australia a multicultural country sydney is the most multicultural city in oceania having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking a language other than english at home furthermore 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas with top countries being italy lebanon vietnam and iraq among others melbourne is also fairly multicultural having the largest greek-speaking population outside of europe and the second largest asian population in australia after sydney european migration to new zealand provided a major influx following the signing of the treaty of waitangi in 1840 subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the british isles but also from continental europe the pacific the americas and asia auckland is home to over half 516 percent of new zealands overseas born population including 72 percent of the countrys pacific island-born population 64 percent of its asian-born population and 56 percent of its middle eastern and african born population hawaii is a majority-minority state chinese workers on western trading ships settled in hawaii starting in 1789 in 1820 the first american missionaries arrived to preach christianity and teach the hawaiians western ways as of 2015 a large proportion of hawaiis population have asian ancestry especially filipino japanese korean and chinese many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century almost 13000 portuguese immigrants had arrived by 1899 they also worked on the sugarcane plantations puerto rican immigration to hawaii began in 1899 when puerto ricos sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from hawaii between 2001 and 2007 australias pacific solution policy transferred asylum seekers to several pacific nations including the nauru detention centre australia new zealand and other nations took part in the regional assistance mission to solomon islands between 2003 and 2017 after a request for aid archaeogenetics archaeology linguistics and existing genetic studies indicate that oceania was settled by two major waves of migration the first migration took place approximately 40 thousand years ago and these migrants papuans colonised much of near oceania approximately 35 thousand years ago a second expansion of austronesian speakers arrived in near oceania and the descendants of these people spread to the far corners of the pacific colonising remote oceania mitochondrial dna mtdna studies quantify the magnitude of the austronesian expansion and demonstrate the homogenising effect of this expansion with regards to papuan influence autochthonous haplogroups support the hypothesis of a long history in near oceania with some lineages suggesting a time depth of 60 thousand years santa cruz a population located in remote oceania is an anomaly with extreme frequencies of autochthonous haplogroups of near oceanian origin large areas of new guinea are unexplored by scientists and anthropologists due to extensive forestation and mountainous terrain known indigenous tribes in papua new guinea have very little contact with local authorities aside from the authorities knowing who they are many remain preliterate and at the national or international level the names of tribes and information about them is extremely hard to obtain the indonesian provinces of papua and west papua on the island of new guinea are home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups economy australia and new zealand australia and new zealand are the only developed nations in the region although the economy of australia is by far the largest and most dominant economy in the region and one of the largest in the world australias per-capita gdp is higher than that of the uk canada germany and france in terms of purchasing power parity new zealand is also one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade the australian securities exchange in sydney is the largest stock exchange in australia and in the south pacific new zealand is the 53rd-largest national economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product gdp and 68th-largest in the world measured by purchasing power parity ppp in 2012 australia was the 12th largest national economy by nominal gdp and the 19th-largest measured by ppp-adjusted gdp mercer quality of living survey ranks sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living making it one of the most livable cities it is classified as an alpha world city by gawc melbourne also ranked highly in the worlds most liveable city list and is a leading financial centre in the asia-pacific region auckland and wellington in new zealand are frequently ranked among the worlds most liveable cities the majority of people living in australia and to a lesser extent new zealand work in mining electrical and manufacturing sectors also australia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region producing cars electrical equipment machinery and clothes pacific islands the overwhelming majority of people living in the pacific islands work in the service industry which includes tourism education and financial services oceanias largest export markets include japan china the united states and south korea the smallest pacific nations rely on trade with australia new zealand and the united states for exporting goods and for accessing other products australia and new zealands trading arrangements are known as closer economic relations australia and new zealand along with other countries are members of asia-pacific economic cooperation apec and the east asia summit eas which may become trade blocs in the future particularly eas the main produce from the pacific is copra or coconut but timber beef palm oil cocoa sugar and ginger are also commonly grown across the tropics of the pacific fishing provides a major industry for many of the smaller nations in the pacific although many fishing areas are exploited by other larger countries namely japan natural resources such as lead zinc nickel and gold are mined in australia and solomon islands oceanias largest export markets include japan china the united states india south korea and the european union endowed with forest mineral and fish resources fiji is one of the most developed of the pacific island economies though it remains a developing country with a large subsistence agriculture sector agriculture accounts for 18 of gross domestic product although it employed some 70 of the workforce as of 2001 sugar exports and the growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign exchange sugar cane processing makes up one-third of industrial activity coconuts ginger and copra are also significant the history of hawaiis economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries sandalwood whaling sugarcane pineapple the military tourism and education hawaiian exports include food and clothing these industries play a small role in the hawaiian economy due to the shipping distance to viable markets such as the west coast of the contiguous us the states food exports include coffee macadamia nuts pineapple livestock sugarcane and honey as of 2015 honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the us tourism tourists mostly come from japan the united kingdom and the united states fiji currently draws almost half a million tourists each year more than a quarter from australia this contributes 1 billion or more since 1995 to fijis economy but the government of fiji islands underestimate these figures due to invisible economy inside tourism industry vanuatu is widely recognised as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the south pacific region tourism has been promoted in part by vanuatu being the site of several reality-tv shows the ninth season of the reality tv series survivor was filmed on vanuatu entitled survivor vanuatu islands of fire two years later australias celebrity survivor was filmed at the same location used by the us version tourism in australia is an important component of the australian economy in the financial year 201415 tourism represented 3 of australias gdp contributing a475 billion to the national economy in 2015 there were 74 million visitor arrivals popular australian destinations include the sydney harbour sydney opera house sydney harbour bridge royal botanic garden etc gold coast theme parks such as warner bros movie world dreamworld and sea world walls of jerusalem national park
