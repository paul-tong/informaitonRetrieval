georges henri joseph douard lematre ras associate french lmt listen 17 july 1894 20 june 1966 was a belgian roman catholic priest mathematician astronomer and professor of physics at the catholic university of louvain he proposed on theoretical grounds that the universe is expanding which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by edwin hubble he was the first to derive what is now known as hubbles law or the hubble-lematre law and made the first estimation of what is now called the hubble constant which he published in 1927 two years before hubbles article lematre also proposed what became known as the big bang theory of the creation of the universe originally calling it the hypothesis of the primeval atom early life after a classical education at a jesuit secondary school the collge du sacr-coeur in charleroi lematre began studying civil engineering at the catholic university of louvain at the age of 17 in 1914 he interrupted his studies to serve as an artillery officer in the belgian army for the duration of world war i at the end of hostilities he received the belgian war cross with palms after the war he studied physics and mathematics and began to prepare for the diocesan priesthood not for the jesuits he obtained his doctorate in 1920 with a thesis entitled lapproximation des fonctions de plusieurs variables relles approximation of functions of several real variables written under the direction of charles de la valle-poussin he was ordained a priest on 22 september 1923 by the cardinal mercier in 1923 he became a research associate in astronomy at cambridge uk spending a year at st edmunds house now st edmunds college university of cambridge he worked with arthur eddington who introduced him to modern cosmology stellar astronomy and numerical analysis he spent the next year at harvard college observatory in cambridge massachusetts with harlow shapley who had just gained renown for his work on nebulae and at the massachusetts institute of technology mit where he registered for the doctoral program in sciences career on his return to belgium in 1925 he became a part-time lecturer at the catholic university of louvain he began the report which brought him international fame when it was published in 1927 in the annales de la socit scientifique de bruxelles annals of the scientific society of brussels under the title un univers homogne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nbuleuses extragalactiques a homogeneous universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae in this report he presented his new idea that the universe is expanding which he derived from general relativity this later became known as hubbles law but lematre provided the first observational estimation of the hubble constant the initial state he proposed was taken to be einsteins own model of a finitely sized static universe the paper had little impact because the journal in which it was published was not widely read by astronomers outside belgium arthur eddington reportedly helped translate the article into english in 1931 but the part of it pertaining to the estimation of the hubble constant was not included in the translation for reasons that remained unknown for a long time this issue was clarified in 2011 by mario livio lematre omitted the paragraphs when himself initially translating the paper for the royal astronomical society in favour of reports of new work on the subject since by that time hubbles calculations had already improved on his earlier ones at this time einstein while not taking exception to the mathematics of lematres theory refused to accept that the universe was expanding lematre recalled his commenting vos calculs sont corrects mais votre physique est abominable your calculations are correct but your physics is atrocious in the same year lematre returned to mit to present his doctoral thesis on the gravitational field in a fluid sphere of uniform invariant density according to the theory of relativity upon obtaining his phd he was named ordinary professor at the catholic university of louvain in 1931 arthur eddington published in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society a long commentary on lematres 1927 article in which he described the latter as a brilliant solution to the outstanding problems of cosmology the original paper was published in an abbreviated english translation later on in 1931 along with a sequel by lematre responding to eddingtons comments lematre was then invited to london to participate in a meeting of the british association on the relation between the physical universe and spirituality there he proposed that the universe expanded from an initial point which he called the primeval atom he developed this idea in a report published in nature lemaitres theory appeared for the first time in an article for the general reader on science and technology subjects in the december 1932 issue of popular science lematres theory became better known as the big bang theory a picturesque term playfully coined during a 1949 bbc radio broadcast by the astronomer fred hoyle who was then still a proponent of the steady state universe and remained so until his death in 2001 lematres proposal met with skepticism from his fellow scientists eddington found lematres notion unpleasant einstein thought it unjustifiable from a physical point of view although he encouraged lematre to look into the possibility of models of non-isotropic expansion so it is clear he was not altogether dismissive of the concept einstein also appreciated lematres argument that einsteins model of a static universe could not be sustained into the infinite past with manuel sandoval vallarta lemaitre discovered that the intensity of cosmic rays varied with latitude because these charged particles are interacting with the earths magnetic field in their calculations lematre and vallarta made use of the mits differential -analyzer computer developed by vannevar bush they also worked on a theory of primary cosmic radiation and applied it to their investigations of the suns magnetic field and the effects of the galaxys rotation lematre and einstein met on four occasions in 1927 in brussels at the time of a solvay conference in 1932 in belgium at the time of a cycle of conferences in brussels in california in january 1933 and in 1935 at princeton in 1933 at the california institute of technology after lematre detailed his theory einstein stood up applauded and is supposed to have said this is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which i have ever listened however there is disagreement over the reporting of this quote in the newspapers of the time and it may be that einstein was not referring to the theory as a whole but only to lematres proposal that cosmic rays may be the leftover artifacts of the initial explosion in 1933 when he resumed his theory of the expanding universe and published a more detailed version in the annals of the scientific society of brussels lematre achieved his greatest public recognition newspapers around the world called him a famous belgian scientist and described him as the leader of the new cosmological physics he was elected a member of the pontifical academy of sciences in 1936 and took an active role there serving as its president from march 1960 until his death in 1941 he was elected a member of the royal academy of sciences and arts of belgium in 1946 he published his book on lhypothse de latome primitif the primeval atom hypothesis it was translated into spanish in the same year and into english in 1950 by 1951 pope pius xii declared that lematres theory provided a scientific validation for catholicism however lematre resented the popes proclamation stating that the theory was neutral and there was neither a connection nor a contradiction between his religion and his theory lematre and daniel oconnell the popes scientific advisor persuaded the pope not to mention creationism publicly and to stop making proclamations about cosmology while a devout roman catholic he opposed mixing science with religion although he held that the two fields were not in conflict during the 1950s he gradually gave up part of his teaching workload ending it completely when he took emeritus status in 1964 in 1962 strongly opposed to the expulsion of french speakers from the catholic university of louvain he created the acapsul movement together with grard garitte to fight against the split during the second vatican council of 196265 he was asked by pope john xxiii to serve on the 4th session of the pontifical commission on birth control however since his health made it impossible for him to travel to rome he suffered a heart attack in december 1964 lematre demurred expressing surprise that he was chosen he told a dominican colleague pre henri de riedmatten that he thought it was dangerous for a mathematician to venture outside of his area of expertise he was also named dometisc prelate monsignor in 1960 by pope john xxiii at the end of his life he was increasingly devoted to problems of numerical calculation he was a remarkable algebraicist and arithmetical calculator since 1930 he had used the most powerful calculating machines of the time the mercedes-euklid in 1958 he was introduced to the universitys burroughs e 101 its first electronic computer lematre maintained a strong interest in the development of computers and even more in the problems of language and computer programming he died on 20 june 1966 shortly after having learned of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation which provided further evidence for his proposal about the birth of the universe work lematre was a pioneer in applying albert einsteins theory of general relativity to cosmology in a 1927 article which preceded edwin hubbles landmark article by two years lematre derived what became known as hubbles law and proposed it as a generic phenomenon in relativistic cosmology lematre also estimated the numerical value of the hubble constant however the data used by lematre did not allow him to prove that there was an actual linear relation which hubble did two years later einstein was skeptical of this paper when lematre approached einstein at the 1927 solvay conference the latter pointed out that alexander friedmann had proposed a similar solution to einsteins equations in 1922 implying that the radius of the universe increased over time einstein had also criticized friedmanns calculations but withdrew his comments in 1931 his annus mirabilis lematre published an article in nature setting out his theory of the primeval atom friedmann was handicapped by living and working in the ussr and died in 1925 soon after inventing the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric because lematre spent his entire career in europe his scientific work is not as well known in the united states as that of hubble or einstein both well known in the us by virtue of residing there nevertheless lematres theory changed the course of cosmology this was because lematre was well acquainted with the work of astronomers and designed his theory to have testable implications and to be in accord with observations of the time in particular to explain the observed redshift of galaxies and the linear relation between distances and velocities proposed his theory at an opportune time since edwin hubble would soon publish his velocity-distance relation that strongly supported an expanding universe and consequently lematres big bang theory had studied under arthur eddington who made sure that lematre got a hearing in the scientific community both friedmann and lematre proposed relativistic cosmologies featuring an expanding universe however lematre was the first to propose that the expansion explains the redshift of galaxies he further concluded that an initial creation-like event must have occurred in the 1980s alan guth and andrei linde modified this theory by adding to it a period of inflation einstein at first dismissed friedmann and then privately lematre out of hand saying that not all mathematics lead to correct theories after hubbles discovery was published einstein quickly and publicly endorsed lematres theory helping both the theory and its proposer get fast recognition lematre was also an early adopter of computers for cosmological calculations he introduced the first computer to his university a burroughs e 101 in 1958 and was one of the inventors of the fast fourier transform algorithm in 1933 lematre found an important inhomogeneous solution of einsteins field equations describing a spherical dust cloud the lematretolman metric in 1931 lemaitre was the first scientist to propose the expansion of the universe was actually accelerating which was confirmed observationally in the 1990s through observations of very distant type ia supernova with the hubble space telescope which led to the 2011 nobel prize in physics in 1948 lematre published a polished mathematical essay quaternions et espace elliptique which clarified an obscure space william kingdon clifford had cryptically described elliptic space in 1873 at a time when versors were too common to mention lematre developed the theory of quaternions from first principles so that his essay can stand on its own but he recalled the erlangen program in geometry while developing the metric geometry of elliptic space h s m coxeter another contributor to elliptic geometry summarized lematres work for mathematical reviews lematre was the first theoretical cosmologist ever nominated in 1954 for the nobel prize in physics for his prediction of the expanding universe remarkably he was also nominated for the 1956 nobel prize in chemistry for his primeval-atom theory honours on 17 march 1934 lematre received the francqui prize the highest belgian scientific distinction from king lopold iii his proposers were albert einstein charles de la valle-poussin and alexandre de hemptinne the members of the international jury were eddington langevin thophile de donder and marcel dehalu the same year he received the mendel medal of the villanova university in 1936 lematre received the prix jules janssen the highest award of the socit astronomique de france the french astronomical society another distinction that the belgian government reserves for exceptional scientists was allotted to him in 1950 the decennial prize for applied sciences for the period 19331942 in 1953 he was given the inaugural eddington medal awarded by the royal astronomical society in 2005 lematre was voted to the 61st
