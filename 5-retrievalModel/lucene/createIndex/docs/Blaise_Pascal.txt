blaise pascal pskl pskl frenchblz paskal 19 june 1623 19 august 1662 was a french mathematician physicist inventor writer and catholic theologian he was a child prodigy who was educated by his father a tax collector in rouen pascals earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of evangelista torricelli pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method in 1642 while still a teenager he started some pioneering work on calculating machines after three years of effort and 50 prototypes he built 20 finished machines called pascals calculators and later pascalines over the following 10 years establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator pascal was an important mathematician helping create two major new areas of research he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16 and later corresponded with pierre de fermat on probability theory strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science following galileo galilei and torricelli in 1647 he rebutted aristotles followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum pascals results caused many disputes before being accepted in 1646 he and his sister jacqueline identified with the religious movement within catholicism known by its detractors as jansenism following a religious experience in late 1654 he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology his two most famous works date from this period the lettres provinciales and the penses the former set in the conflict between jansenists and jesuits in that year he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids throughout his life pascal was in frail health especially after the age of 18 he died just two months after his 39th birthday early life and education pascal was born in clermont-ferrand which is in frances auvergne region he lost his mother antoinette begon at the age of three his father tienne pascal 15881651 who also had an interest in science and mathematics was a local judge and member of the noblesse de robe pascal had two sisters the younger jacqueline and the elder gilberte in 1631 five years after the death of his wife tienne pascal moved with his children to paris the newly arrived family soon hired louise delfault a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family tienne who never remarried decided that he alone would educate his children for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability particularly his son blaise the young pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science particularly of interest to pascal was a work of desargues on conic sections following desargues thinking the 16-year-old pascal produced as a means of proof a short treatise on what was called the mystic hexagram essai pour les coniques essay on conics and sent ithis first serious work of mathematicsto pre mersenne in paris it is known still today as pascals theorem it states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle or conic then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line called the pascal line pascals work was so precocious that descartes was convinced that pascals father had written it when assured by mersenne that it was indeed the product of the son and not the father descartes dismissed it with a sniff i do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients adding but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child in france at that time offices and positions could beand werebought and sold in 1631 tienne sold his position as second president of the cour des aides for 65665 livres the money was invested in a government bond which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the pascal family to move to and enjoy paris but in 1638 richelieu desperate for money to carry on the thirty years war defaulted on the governments bonds suddenly tienne pascals worth had dropped from nearly 66000 livres to less than 7300 like so many others tienne was eventually forced to flee paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of cardinal richelieu leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour madame sainctot a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all france it was only when jacqueline performed well in a childrens play with richelieu in attendance that tienne was pardoned in time tienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the kings commissioner of taxes in the city of rouena city whose tax records thanks to uprisings were in utter chaos in 1642 in an effort to ease his fathers endless exhausting calculations and recalculations of taxes owed and paid into which work the young pascal had been recruited pascal not yet 19 constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction called pascals calculator or the pascaline of the eight pascalines known to have survived four are held by the muse des arts et mtiers in paris and one more by the zwinger museum in dresden germany exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering the calculator failed to be a great commercial success partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive the pascaline became little more than a toy and a status symbol for the very rich both in france and elsewhere in europe pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design contributions to mathematics pascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life his trait du triangle arithmtique treatise on the arithmetical triangle of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients now called pascals triangle the triangle can also be represented he defines the numbers in the triangle by recursion call the number in the m1th row and n1th column tmn then tmntm1ntmn1 for m012 and n012 the boundary conditions are tm10 t1n0 for m123 and n123 the generator t001 pascal concludes with the proof in 1654 he proved pascals identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p 0 1 2 k in 1654 prompted by his friend the chevalier de mr he corresponded with pierre de fermat on the subject of gambling problems and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities the specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and given the current circumstances of the game want to divide the stakes fairly based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point from this discussion the notion of expected value was introduced pascal later in the penses used a probabilistic argument pascals wager to justify belief in god and a virtuous life the work done by fermat and pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for leibniz formulation of the calculus after a religious experience in 1654 pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics philosophy of mathematics pascals major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his de lesprit gomtrique of the geometrical spirit originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous petites-ecoles de port-royal little schools of port-royal the work was unpublished until over a century after his death here pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths at the same time however he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them upfirst principles therefore cannot be reached based on this pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them nevertheless there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true pascal also used de lesprit gomtrique to develop a theory of definition he distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent the second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by descartes in de lart de persuader on the art of persuasion pascal looked deeper into geometrys axiomatic method specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based pascal agreed with montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible he asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to god in searching out truths contributions to the physical sciences pascals work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids his inventions include the hydraulic press using hydraulic pressure to multiply force and the syringe he proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference he demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building this caused the barrel to leak in what became known as pascals barrel experiment by 1647 pascal had learned of evangelista torricellis experimentation with barometers having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube at the time most scientists contended that rather than a vacuum some invisible matter was present this was based on the aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance whether visible or invisible and that this substance was forever in motion furthermore everything that is in motion must be moved by something aristotle declared therefore to the aristotelian trained scientists of pascals time a vacuum was an impossibility how so as proof it was pointed out light passed through the so-called vacuum in the glass tube aristotle wrote how everything moved and must be moved by something therefore since there had to be an invisible something to move the light through the glass tube there was no vacuum in the tube not in the glass tube or anywhere else vacuums the absence of any and everything were simply an impossibility following more experimentation in this vein in 1647 pascal produced experiences nouvelles touchant le vide new experiments with the vacuum which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure it also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube this work was followed by rcit de la grande exprience de lquilibre des liqueurs account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids published in 1648 the torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury if air has a finite weight earths atmosphere must have a maximum height pascal reasoned that if true air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude he lived near the puy de dme mountain 4790 feet 1460m tall but his health was poor so could not climb it on 19 september 1648 after many months of pascals friendly but insistent prodding florin prier husband of pascals elder sister gilberte was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to pascals theory the account written by prier reads the weather was chancy last saturdaybut around five oclock that morningthe puy-de-dme was visibleso i decided to give it a try several important people of the city of clermont had asked me to let them know when i would make the ascenti was delighted to have them with me in this great work at eight oclock we met in the gardens of the minim fathers which has the lowest elevation in townfirst i poured 16 pounds of quicksilverinto a vesselthen took several glass tubeseach four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the otherthen placed them in the vessel of quicksilveri found the quick silver stood at 26 and 32 lines above the quicksilver in the vesseli repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spotthey produced the same result each time i attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver andasked father chastin one of the minim brothersto watch if any changes should occur through the daytaking the other tube and a portion of the quick silveri walked to the top of puy-de-dme about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery where upon experimentfound that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23 and 2 linesi repeated the experiment five times with careeach at different points on the summitfound the same height of quicksilverin each case pascal replicated the experiment in paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie a height of about 50 metres the mercury dropped two lines in the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in pascals empty space pascal in his reply to estienne noel gave one of the 17th centurys major statements on the scientific method which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by karl popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability in order to show that a hypothesis is evident it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it instead if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena that suffices to establish its falsity his insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists including descartes pascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine adult life religion philosophy and literature for after all what is man in nature a nothing in relation to infinity all in relation to nothing a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either the ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret he is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed religious conversion in the winter of 1646 pascals 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of rouen given the mans age and the state of medicine in the 17th century a broken hip could be a very serious condition perhaps even fatal rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in france monsieur doctor deslandes and monsieur doctor de la bouteillerie the elder pascal would not let anyone other than these men attend himit was a good choice for the old man survived and was able to walk again but treatment and rehabilitation took three months during which time la bouteillerie and deslandes had become regular visitors both men were followers of jean guillebert proponent of a splinter group from catholic teaching known as jansenism this still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the french catholic community at that time it espoused rigorous augustinism blaise spoke with the doctors frequently and after their successful treatment of his father borrowed from them works by jansenist authors in this period pascal experienced a sort of first conversion and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his worldly period 164854 his father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to pascal and his sister jacqueline for whom pascal acted as conservator jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the jansenist convent of port-royal pascal was deeply affected and very sad not because of her choice but because of his chronic poor health he needed her just as she had needed him suddenly there was war in the pascal household blaise pleaded with jacqueline not to leave but she was adamant he commanded her to stay but that didnt work either at the heart of this wasblaises fear of abandonmentif jacqueline entered port-royal she would have to leave her inheritance behindbut nothing would change her mind by the end of october in 1651 a truce had been reached between brother and sister in return for a healthy annual stipend jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry in early january jacqueline left for port-royal on that day according to gilberte concerning her brother he retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing jacqueline who was waiting in the little parlor in early june 1653 after what must have seemed like endless badgering from jacqueline pascal formally signed over the whole of his sisters inheritance to port-royal which to him had begun to smell like a cult with two thirds of his fathers estate now gone the 29-year-old pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty for a while pascal pursued the life of a bachelor during visits to his sister at port-royal in 1654 he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to god brush with death on 23 november 1654 between 1030 and 1230 at night pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began fire god of abraham god of isaac god of jacob not of the philosophers and the scholars and concluded by quoting psalm 11916 i will not forget thy word amen he seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes a servant discovered it only by chance after his death this piece is now known as the memorial the story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the memorial is disputed by some scholars his belief and religious commitment revitalized pascal visited the older of two convents at port-royal for a two-week retreat in january 1655 for the next four years he regularly travelled between port-royal and paris it was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion the provincial letters the provincial letters beginning in 165657 pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry a popular ethical method used by catholic thinkers in the early modern period especially the jesuits and in particular antonio escobar pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins the 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym louis de montalte and incensed louis xiv the king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660 in 1661 in the midsts of the formulary controversy the jansenist school at port-royal was condemned and closed down those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of jansen as heretical the final letter from pascal in 1657 had defied alexander vii himself even pope alexander while publicly opposing them nonetheless was persuaded by pascals arguments aside from their religious influence the provincial letters were popular as a literary work pascals use of humor mockery and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption and influenced the prose of later french writers like voltaire and jean-jacques rousseau charles perrault wrote of the letters everything is therepurity of language nobility of thought solidity in reasoning finesse in raillery and throughout an agrment not to be found anywhere else the penses pascals most influential theological work referred to posthumously as the penses thoughts was not completed before his death it was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the christian faith with the original title apologie de la religion chrtienne defense of the christian religion the first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled penses de m pascal sur la religion et sur quelques autres sujets thoughts of m pascal on religion and on some other subjects and soon thereafter became a classic one of the apologies main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism personalized by montaigne on one hand and epictetus on the other in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace god pascals penses is widely considered to be a masterpiece and a landmark in french prose when commenting on one particular section thought 72 sainte-beuve praised it as the finest pages in the french language will durant hailed the penses as the most eloquent book in french prose last works and death t s eliot described him during this phase of his life as a man of the world among ascetics and an ascetic among men of the world pascals ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer in 1659 pascal fell seriously ill during his last years he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors saying sickness is the natural state of christians louis xiv suppressed the jansenist movement at port-royal in 1661 in response pascal wrote one of his final works crit sur la signature du formulaire writ on the signing of the form exhorting the jansenists not to give in later that year his sister jacqueline died which convinced pascal to cease his polemics on jansenism pascals last major achievement returning to his mechanical genius was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line the carrosses cinq sols moving passengers within paris in a carriage with many seats in 1662 pascals illness became more violent and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sisters death aware that his health was fading quickly he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried in paris on 18 august 1662 pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction he died the next morning his last words being may god never abandon me and was buried in the cemetery of saint-tienne-du-mont an autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen along with damage to his brain despite the autopsy the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined though speculation focuses on tuberculosis stomach cancer or a combination of the two the headaches which afflicted pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion legacy in honour of his scientific contributions the name pascal has been given to the si unit of pressure to a programming language and pascals law an important principle of hydrostatics and as mentioned above pascals triangle and pascals wager still bear his name pascals development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics originally applied to gambling today it is extremely important in economics especially in actuarial science john ross writes probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty risk decision-making and an individuals and societys ability to influence the course of future events however it should be noted that pascal and fermat though doing important early work in probability theory did not develop the field very far christiaan huygens learning of the subject from the correspondence of pascal and fermat wrote the first book on the subject later figures who continued the development of the theory include abraham de moivre and pierre-simon laplace in literature pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the french classical period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of french prose his use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists the content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of ren descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy empiricism was also insufficient for determining major truths in france prestigious annual awards blaise pascal chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the ile de france region one of the universities of clermont-ferrand france universit blaise pascal is named after him the university of waterloo ontario canada holds an annual math contest named in his honour pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that we are according to wood born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject god continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness roberto rossellini directed a filmed biopic blaise pascal which originally aired on italian television in 1971 pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 bbc two documentary sea of faith presented by don cupitt in 2014 nvidia announced its new pascal microarchitecture which is named for pascal the first graphics cards featuring pascal were released in 2016 the 2017 game nier automata has multiple characters named after famous philosophers one of
