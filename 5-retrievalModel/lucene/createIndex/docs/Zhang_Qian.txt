diplomat to bring back reliable information about central asia to the chinese imperial court then under emperor wu of han and played an important pioneering role in the chinese colonization and conquest of the region now known as xinjiang today zhang qians travels are associated with the major route of transcontinental trade the silk road in essence his missions opened up to china the many kingdoms and products of a part of the world then unknown to the chinese zhang qians accounts of his explorations of central asia are detailed in the early han historical chronicles records of the grand historian compiled by sima qian in the 1st century bc the central asian sections of the silk road routes were expanded around 114 bc largely through the missions and explorations of zhang qian today qian is considered a national hero and revered for the key role he played in opening china to the world of commercial trade zhang qians missions zhang qian was born in chenggu district just east of hanzhong in the north central province of shaanxi china he entered the capital changan todays xian between 140 bc and 134 bc as a gentleman serving emperor wu of the han dynasty at the time the nomadic xiongnu tribes controlled what is now inner mongolia and dominated the western regions xiyu the areas neighbouring the territory of the han dynasty the han emperor was interested in establishing commercial ties with distant lands but outside contact was prevented by the hostile xiongnu the han court dispatched zhang qian a military officer who was familiar with the xiongnu to the western regions in 138 bc with a group of ninety-nine members to make contact and build an alliance with the yuezhi against the xiongnu he was accompanied by a guide named ganfu a xiongnu who had been captured in war the objective of zhang qians first mission was to seek a military alliance with the yuezhi in modern tajikistan however to get to the territory of the yuezhi he was forced to pass through land controlled by the xiongnu who captured him as well as ganfu and enslaved him for ten years during this time he married a xiongnu wife who bore him a son and gained the trust of the xiongnu leader zhang and ganfu as well as zhangs xiongnu wife and son were eventually able to escape and passing lop nor and following the northern edge of the tarim basin around the kunlun mountains and through small fortified areas in the middle of oases in what is now xinjiang until they made their way to dayuan and eventually to the land of the yuezhi the yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including alfalfa for animal fodder however the yuezhi were too settled to desire war against the xiongnu zhang spent a year in yuezhi and the adjacent bactrian territory documenting their cultures lifestyles and economy before beginning his return trip to china this time following the southern edge of the tarim basin on his return trip he was again captured by the xiongnu who again spared his life because they valued his sense of duty and composure in the face of death two years later the xiongnu leader died and in the midst of chaos and infighting zhang qian escaped of the original mission of just over a hundred men only zhang qian and ganfu managed to return to china zhang qian returned in 125 bc with detailed news for the emperor showing that sophisticated civilizations existed to the west with which china could advantageously develop relations the shiji relates that the emperor learned of the dayuan daxia anxi and the others all great states rich in unusual products whose people cultivated the land and made their living in much the same way as the chinese all these states he was told were militarily weak and prized han goods and wealth upon zhang qians return to china he was honoured with a position of palace counselor although he was unable to develop commercial ties between china and these far-off lands his efforts did eventually result in trade mission to the wu-sun people in 119 bc which led to trade between china and persia on his mission zhang qian had noticed products from an area now known as northern india however the task remained to find a trade route not obstructed by the xiongnu to india zhang qian set out on a second mission to forge a route from china to india via sichuan but after many attempts this effort proved unsuccessful in 119115 bc zhang qian was sent on a third mission by the emperor to develop ties with the wusun people zhang qians reports the reports of zhang qians travels are quoted extensively in the 1st century bc chinese historic chronicles records of the great historian shiji by sima qian zhang qian visited directly the kingdom of dayuan in ferghana the territories of the yuezhi in transoxiana the bactrian country of daxia with its remnants of greco-bactrian rule and kangju he also made reports on neighbouring countries that he did not visit such as anxi arsacid territories tiaozhi seleucid empire in mesopotamia shendu pakistan and the wusun dayuan ferghana after being released from captivity by xiongnu zhang qian visited dayuan located in the fergana region west of the tarim basin the people of dayuan were being portrayed as sophisticated urban dwellers similar to the parthians and the bactrians the name dayuan is thought to be a transliteration of the word yona the greek descendants that occupied the region from the 4th to the 2nd century bce it was during this stay that zhang reported the famous tall and powerful blood-sweating ferghana horse the refusal by dayuan to offer these horses to emperor wu of han resulted in two punitive campaigns launched by the han dynasty to acquire these horses by force rouzhi yuezhi after obtaining the help of the king of dayuan zhang qian went southwest to the territory of the yuezhi with whom he was supposed to obtain a military alliance against the xiongnu zhang qian also describes the origins of the yuezhi explaining they came from the eastern part of the tarim basin this has encouraged some historians to connect them to the caucasoid mummies of the tarim the question of links between the yuezhi and the tocharians of the tarim is more controversial a smaller group of yuezhi the little yuezhi were not able to follow the exodus and reportedly found refuge among the qiang barbarians zhang was the first chinese to write about one humped dromedary camels which he saw in this region daxia bactria zhang qian probably witnessed the last period of the greco-bactrian kingdom as it was being subjugated by the nomadic yuezhi only small powerless chiefs remained who were apparently vassals to the yuezhi horde their civilization was urban almost identical to the civilizations of anxi and dayuan and the population was numerous cloth from shu sichuan was found there shendu india zhang qian also reports about the existence of india southeast of bactria the name shendu comes from the sanskrit word sindhu meaning the indus river of pakistan sindh was one of the richest regions of india at the time ruled by indo-greek kingdoms which explains the reported cultural similarity between bactria and india anxi parthia zhang qian identifies anxi chinese as an advanced urban civilization like dayuan ferghana and daxia bactria the name anxi is a transcription of arshak arsaces the name of the founder of arsacid empire that ruled the regions along the silk road between the tedzhen river in the east and the tigris in the west and running through aria parthia proper and media proper tiaozhi seleucid empire in mesopotamia zhang qians reports on mesopotamia and the seleucid empire or tiaozhi are in tenuous terms he did not himself visit the region and was only able to report what others told him kangju northwest of sogdiana zhang qian also visited directly the area of sogdiana kangju home to the sogdian nomads yancai vast steppe

worshipping buddhist statues explaining them as golden men brought in 120 bc by a great han general in his campaigns against the nomads although there is no other mention of han wudi worshipping the buddha in chinese historical literature china also sent a mission to anxi which were followed up by reciprocal missions from parthian envoys around 100 bc the roman historian florus describes the visit of numerous envoys including seres chinese or central asians to the first roman emperor augustus who reigned between 27 bc and 14 in 97 the chinese general ban chao dispatched an envoy to rome
