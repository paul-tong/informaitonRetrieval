hubbles law also known as the hubblelematre law is the observation in physical cosmology that objects observed in deep spaceextragalactic space 10 megaparsecs mpc or moreare found to have a redshift interpreted as a relative velocity away from earth this doppler shift-measured velocity of various galaxies receding from the earth is approximately proportional to their distance from the earth for galaxies up to a few hundred megaparsecs away hubbles law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the big bang model the motion of astronomical objects due solely to this expansion is known as the hubble flow although widely attributed to edwin hubble the law was first derived from the general relativity equations in 1922 by alexander friedmann friedmann published a set of equations now known as the friedmann equations showing that the universe might expand and presenting the expansion speed if this was the case then georges lematre in a 1927 article proposed the expansion of the universe and suggested an estimated value of the rate of expansion which when corrected by hubble became known as the hubble constant however though the hubble constant h 0 displaystyle h0 is roughly constant in the velocity-distance space at this moment in time the hubble parameter h displaystyle h which the hubble constant is the current value of changes with time so the term constant is sometimes thought of as somewhat of a misnomer moreover two years later edwin hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name hubble inferred the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by vesto slipher in 1917 in october 2018 scientists presented a new third way two earlier methods gave problematic results that do not agree using information from gravitational wave events especially those involving the merger of neutron stars like gw170817 of determining the hubble constant essential in establishing the exact rate of expansion of the universe the law is often expressed by the equation v h0d with h0 the constant of proportionalityhubble constantbetween the proper distance d to a galaxy which can change over time unlike the comoving distance and its velocity v ie the derivative of proper distance with respect to cosmological time coordinate see uses of the proper distance for some discussion of the subtleties of this definition of velocity also the si unit of h0 is s but it is most frequently quoted in kmsmpc thus giving the speed in kms of a galaxy 1 megaparsec 30910km away the reciprocal of h0 is the hubble time observed values of the hubble constant discovery a decade before hubble made his observations a number of physicists and mathematicians had established a consistent theory of the relationship between space and time by using einsteins field equations of general relativity applying the most general principles to the nature of the universe yielded a dynamic solution that conflicted with the then-prevailing notion of a static universe flrw equations in 1922 alexander friedmann derived his friedmann equations from einsteins field equations showing that the universe might expand at a rate calculable by the equations the parameter used by friedmann is known today as the scale factor which can be considered as a scale invariant form of the proportionality constant of hubbles law georges lematre independently found a similar solution in 1927 the friedmann equations are derived by inserting the metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe into einsteins field equations for a fluid with a given density and pressure this idea of an expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the big bang and steady state theories of cosmology lematres equation in 1927 two years before hubble published his own article the belgian priest and astronomer georges lematre was the first to publish research deriving what is now known as hubbles law according to the canadian astronomer sidney van den bergh the 1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by lematre was published in french in a low-impact journal in the 1931 high-impact english translation of this article a critical equation was changed by omitting reference to what is now known as the hubble constant it is now known that the alterations in the translated paper were carried out by lemaitre himself shape of the universe before the advent of modern cosmology there was considerable talk about the size and shape of the universe in 1920 the shapley-curtis debate took place between harlow shapley and heber d curtis over this issue shapley argued for a small universe the size of the milky way galaxy and curtis argued that the universe was much larger the issue was resolved in the coming decade with hubbles improved observations cepheid variable stars outside of the milky way edwin hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at mount wilson observatory home to the worlds most powerful telescope at the time his observations of cepheid variable stars in spiral nebulae enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects surprisingly these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the milky way they continued to be called nebulae and it was only gradually that the term galaxies replaced it combining redshifts with distance measurements the parameters that appear in hubbles law velocities and distances are not directly measured in reality we determine say a supernova brightness which provides information about its distance and the redshift z of its spectrum of radiation hubble correlated brightness and parameter z combining his measurements of galaxy distances with vesto slipher and milton humasons measurements of the redshifts associated with the galaxies hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance though there was considerable scatter now known to be caused by peculiar velocitiesthe hubble flow is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the hubble constant of 500kmsmpc much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations see cosmic distance ladder for details at the time of discovery and development of hubbles law it was acceptable to explain redshift phenomenon as a doppler shift in the context of special relativity and use the doppler formula to associate redshift z with velocity today in the context of general relativity velocity between distant objects depends on the choice of coordinates used and therefore the redshift can be equally described as a doppler shift or a cosmological shift or gravitational due to the expanding space or some combination of the two hubble diagram hubbles law can be easily depicted in a hubble diagram in which the velocity assumed approximately proportional to the redshift of an object is plotted with respect to its distance from the observer a straight line of positive slope on this diagram is the visual depiction of hubbles law cosmological constant abandoned after hubbles discovery was published albert einstein abandoned his work on the cosmological constant which he had designed to modify his equations of general relativity to allow them to produce a static solution which he thought was the correct state of the universe the einstein equations in their simplest form model generally either an expanding or contracting universe so einsteins cosmological constant was artificially created to counter the expansion or contraction to get a perfect static and flat universe after hubbles discovery that the universe was in fact expanding einstein called his faulty assumption that the universe is static his biggest mistake on its own general relativity could predict the expansion of the universe which through observations such as the bending of light by large masses or the precession of the orbit of mercury could be experimentally observed and compared to his theoretical calculations using particular solutions of the equations he had originally formulated in 1931 einstein made a trip to mount wilson to thank hubble for providing the observational basis for modern cosmology the cosmological constant has regained attention in recent decades as a hypothesis for dark energy interpretation the discovery of the linear relationship between redshift and distance coupled with a supposed linear relation between recessional velocity and redshift yields a straightforward mathematical expression for hubbles law as follows where v displaystyle v is the recessional velocity typically expressed in kms h0 is hubbles constant and corresponds to the value of h displaystyle h often termed the hubble parameter which is a value that is time dependent and which can be expressed in terms of the scale factor in the friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0 this value is the same throughout the universe for a given comoving time d displaystyle d is the proper distance which can change over time unlike the comoving distance which is constant from the galaxy to the observer measured in mega parsecs mpc in the 3-space defined by given cosmological time recession velocity is just v dddt hubbles law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance however the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts for distances d larger than the radius of the hubble sphere rhs objects recede at a rate faster than the speed of light see uses of the proper distance for a discussion of the significance of this since the hubble constant is a constant only in space not in time the radius of the hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals the subscript 0 indicates the value of the hubble constant today current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating see accelerating universe meaning that for any given galaxy the recession velocity dddt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances however the hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance d and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones redshift velocity and recessional velocity redshift can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition such as hydrogen -lines for distant quasars and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference thus redshift is a quantity unambiguous for experimental observation the relation of redshift to recessional velocity is another matter for an extensive discussion see harrison redshift velocity the redshift z is often described as a redshift velocity which is the recessional velocity that would produce the same redshift if it were caused by a linear doppler effect which however is not the case as the shift is caused in part by a cosmological expansion of space and because the velocities involved are too large to use a non-relativistic formula for doppler shift this redshift velocity can easily exceed the speed of light in other words to determine the redshift velocity vrs the relation is used that is there is no fundamental difference between redshift velocity and redshift they are rigidly proportional and not related by any theoretical reasoning the motivation behind the redshift velocity terminology is that the redshift velocity agrees with the velocity from a low-velocity simplification of the so-called fizeau-doppler formula here o e are the observed and emitted wavelengths respectively the redshift velocity vrs is not so simply related to real velocity at larger velocities however and this terminology leads to confusion if interpreted as a real velocity next the connection between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed this discussion is based on sartori recessional velocity suppose rt is called the scale factor of the universe and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the cosmological model selected its meaning is that all measured proper distances dt between co-moving points increase proportionally to r the co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space in other words where t0 is some reference time if light is emitted from a galaxy at time te and received by us at t0 it is redshifted due to the expansion of space and this redshift z is simply suppose a galaxy is at distance d and this distance changes with time at a rate dtd we call this rate of recession the recession velocity vr we now define the hubble constant as and discover the hubble law from this perspective hubbles law is a fundamental relation between i the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of space and ii the distance to an object the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect hubbles law with observations this law can be related to redshift z approximately by making a taylor series expansion if the distance is not too large all other complications of the model become small corrections and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light or according to this approach the relation cz vr is an approximation valid at low redshifts to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent see velocity-redshift figure observability of parameters strictly speaking neither v nor d in the formula are directly observable because they are properties now of a galaxy whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past at the time that the light we currently see left it for relatively nearby galaxies redshift z much less than unity v and d will not have changed much and v can be estimated using the formula v z c displaystyle vzc where c is the speed of light this gives the empirical relation found by hubble for distant galaxies v or d cannot be calculated from z without specifying a detailed model for how h changes with time the redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out but it does have a simple interpretation 1z is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was travelling towards the observer expansion velocity vs relative velocity in using hubbles law to determine distances only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe these relative velocities called peculiar velocities need to be accounted for in the application of hubbles law the finger of god effect is one result of this phenomenon in systems that are gravitationally bound such as galaxies or our planetary system the expansion of space is a much weaker effect than the attractive force of gravity time-dependence of hubble parameter the parameter h displaystyle h is commonly called the hubble constant but that is a misnomer since it is constant in space only at a fixed time it varies with time in nearly all cosmological models and all observations of far distant objects are also observations into the distant past when the constant had a different value the hubble parameter is a more correct term with h 0 displaystyle h0 denoting the present-day value another common source of confusion is that the accelerating universe does not imply that the hubble parameter is actually increasing with time since h t a t a t displaystyle htequiv dot atat in most accelerating models a displaystyle a increases relatively faster than a displaystyle dot a so h decreases with time the recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times on defining the dimensionless deceleration parameter from this it is seen that the hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless q 1 displaystyle q-1 the latter can only occur if the universe contains phantom energy regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable however in the standard lambda-cdm model q displaystyle q will tend to 1 from above in the distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter this implies that h displaystyle h will approach from above to a constant value of 57 displaystyle approx 57 kmsmpc and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time idealized hubbles law the mathematical derivation of an idealized hubbles law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of geometry in 3-dimensional cartesiannewtonian coordinate space which considered as a metric space is entirely homogeneous and isotropic properties do not vary with location or direction simply stated the theorem is this any two points which are moving away from the origin each along straight lines and with speed proportional to distance from the origin will be moving away from each other with a speed proportional to their distance apart in fact this applies to non-cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic specifically to the negatively and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models see shape of the universe an observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on earth is not an indication that earth is near to a center from which the expansion is occurring but rather that every observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding from them ultimate fate and age of the universe the value of the hubble parameter changes over time either increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-called deceleration parameter q displaystyle q which is defined by in a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero it follows that h 1t where t is the time since the big bang a non-zero time-dependent value of q displaystyle q simply requires integration of the friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the comoving horizon size was zero it was long thought that q was positive indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction this would imply an age of the universe less than 1h which is about 14 billion years for instance a value for q of 12 once favoured by most theorists would give the age of the universe as 23h the discovery in 1998 that q is apparently negative means that the universe could actually be older than 1h however estimates of the age of the universe are very close to 1h olbers paradox the expansion of space summarized by the big bang interpretation of hubbles law is relevant to the old conundrum known as olbers paradox if the universe were infinite in size static and filled with a uniform distribution of stars then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star and the sky would be as bright as the surface of a star however the night sky is largely dark since the 17thcentury astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the big bang theory and in part on the hubble expansion in a universe that exists for a finite amount of time only the light of a finite number of stars has had enough time to reach us and the paradox is resolved additionally in an expanding universe distant objects recede from us which causes the light emanated from them to be redshifted and diminished in brightness by the time we see it dimensionless hubble parameter instead of working with hubbles constant a common practice is to introduce the dimensionless hubble parameter usually denoted by h and to write the hubbles parameter h0 as h100kmsmpc all the relative uncertainty of the true value of h0 being then relegated to h occasionally a reference value different to 100 may be chosen in which case a subscript is presented after h to avoid confusion eg h70 denotes h 0 70 h 70 displaystyle h070h70 kmsmpc which implies h 70 h 07 displaystyle h70h07 this should not be confused with the dimensionless value of hubbles constant usually expressed in terms of planck units with current of h0tp11810 determining the hubble constant the value of the hubble constant is estimated by measuring the redshift of distant galaxies and then determining the distances to the same galaxies by some other method than hubbles law uncertainties in the physical assumptions used to determine these distances have caused varying estimates of the hubble constant the observations of astronomer walter baade led him to define distinct populations for stars population i and population ii the same observations led him to discover that there are two types of cepheid variable stars using this discovery he recalculated the size of the known universe doubling the previous calculation made by hubble in 1929 he announced this finding to considerable astonishment at the 1952 meeting of the international astronomical union in rome in october 2018 scientists presented a new third way two earlier methods one based on redshifts and another on the cosmic distance ladder gave results that do not agree using information from gravitational wave events especially those involving the merger of neutron stars like gw170817 of determining the hubble constant essential in establishing the rate of expansion of the universe earlier measurement and discussion approaches for most of the second half of the 20th century the value of h 0 displaystyle h0 was estimated to be between 50 and 90 kmsmpc the value of the hubble constant was the topic of a long and rather bitter controversy between grard de vaucouleurs who claimed the value was around 100 and allan sandage who claimed the value was near 50 in 1996 a debate moderated by john bahcall between sidney van den bergh and gustav tammann was held in similar fashion to the earlier shapley-curtis debate over these two competing values this previously wide variance in estimates was partially resolved with the introduction of the cdm model of the universe in the late 1990s with the cdm model observations of high-redshift clusters at x-ray and microwave wavelengths using the sunyaevzeldovich effect measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation and optical surveys all gave a value of around 70 for the constant more recent measurements from the planck mission indicate a lower value of around 67 although even more recently in february 2018 a higher value of 73 has been determined using an improved procedure involving the hubble space telescope see table of measurements above for many recent and older measurements acceleration of the expansion a value for q displaystyle q measured from standard candle observations of type ia supernovae which was determined in 1998 to be negative surprised many astronomers with the implication that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating although the hubble factor is still decreasing with time as mentioned above in the interpretation section see the articles on dark energy and the cdm model derivation of the hubble parameter start with the friedmann equation where h displaystyle h is the hubble parameter a displaystyle a is the scale factor g is the gravitational constant k displaystyle k is the normalised spatial curvature of the universe and equal to 1 0 or 1 and displaystyle lambda is the cosmological constant matter-dominated universe with a cosmological constant if the universe is matter-dominated then the mass density of the universe displaystyle rho can just be taken to include matter so where m 0 displaystyle rho m0 is the density of matter today we know for nonrelativistic particles that their mass density decreases proportional to the inverse volume of the universe so the equation above must be true we can also define see density parameter for m displaystyle omega m therefore also by definition where the subscript nought refers to the values today and a 0 1 displaystyle a01 substituting all of this into the friedmann equation at the start of this section and replacing a displaystyle a with a 1 1 z displaystyle a11z gives matter- and dark energy-dominated universe if the universe is both matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated then the above equation for the hubble parameter will also be a function of the equation of state of dark energy so now where d e displaystyle rho de is the mass density of the dark energy by definition an equation of state in cosmology is p w c 2 displaystyle pwrho c2 and if this is substituted into the fluid equation which describes how the mass density of the universe evolves with time then if w is constant then implying therefore for dark energy with a constant equation of state w d e a d e 0 a 3 1 w displaystyle rho dearho de0a-31w if this is substituted into the friedman equation in a similar way as before but this time set k 0 displaystyle k0 which assumes a spatially flat universe then see shape of the universe if the dark energy derives from a cosmological constant such as that introduced by einstein it can be shown that w 1 displaystyle w-1 the equation then reduces to the last equation in the matter-dominated universe section with k displaystyle omega k set to zero in that case the initial dark energy density d e 0 displaystyle rho de0 is given by if dark energy does not have a constant equation-of-state w then and to solve this w a displaystyle wa must be parametrized for example if w a w 0 w a 1 a displaystyle waw0wa1-a giving other ingredients have been formulated recently units derived from the hubble constant hubble time the hubble constant h 0 displaystyle h0 has units of inverse time the hubble time th is simply defined as the inverse of the hubble constant ie this is slightly different from the age of the universe which is approximately 138 billion years the hubble time is the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear and it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear they are related by a dimensionless factor which depends on the mass-energy content of the universe which is around 096 in the standard lambda-cdm model we currently appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential due to the increasing dominance of vacuum energy in this regime the hubble parameter is constant and the universe grows by a factor e each hubble time over long periods of time the dynamics are complicated by general relativity dark energy inflation etc as explained above hubble length the hubble length or hubble distance is a unit of distance in cosmology defined as c h 0 1 displaystyle ch0-1 the speed of light multiplied by the hubble time it is equivalent to 4550 million parsecs or 144 billion light years the numerical value of the hubble length in light years is by definition equal to that of the hubble time in years the hubble distance would be the distance between the earth and the galaxies which are currently receding from us at the speed of light as can be seen by substituting d c h 0 1 displaystyle dch0-1 into the equation for hubbles law v h0d hubble volume the hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a comoving size of c h 0 1 displaystyle ch0-1 the exact definition varies it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius c h 0 1 displaystyle ch0-1 or alternatively a cube of side c h 0 1 displaystyle ch0-1 some cosmologists even use the term hubble volume to refer to the volume of the observable universe although this has a radius approximately three times larger see also cosmology portal accelerating
