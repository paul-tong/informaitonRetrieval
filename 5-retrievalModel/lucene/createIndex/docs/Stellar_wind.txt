a stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star it is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric different types of stars have different types of stellar winds post-main-sequence stars nearing the ends of their lives often eject large quantities of mass in massive m 10 3 displaystyle scriptstyle dot m10-3 solar masses per year slow v 10kms winds these include red giants and supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars these winds are understood to be driven by radiation pressure on dust condensing in the upper atmosphere of the stars massive stars of types o and b have stellar winds with lower mass loss rates m 10 6 displaystyle scriptstyle dot m10-6 solar masses per year but very high velocities v 12000kms such winds are driven by radiation pressure on the resonance absorption lines of heavy elements such as carbon and nitrogen these high-energy stellar winds blow stellar wind bubbles g-type stars like the earths sun have a wind driven by their hot magnetized corona the suns wind is called the solar wind these winds consist mostly of high-energy electrons and protons about 1 kev that are able to escape the stars gravity because of the high temperature of the corona stellar winds from main-sequence stars do not strongly influence the evolution of lower mass stars such as the sun however for more massive stars such as o stars the mass loss can result in a star shedding as much as 50 of its mass whilst on the main sequence this clearly has a significant impact on the later stages of evolution the influence can even be seen for intermediate mass stars which will become white dwarfs at the ends of their lives rather than exploding as supernovae only because they lost enough mass in their winds see also space portal cosmic ray cosmic wind
