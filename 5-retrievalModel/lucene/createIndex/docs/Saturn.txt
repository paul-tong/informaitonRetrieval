saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest in the solar system after jupiter it is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of earth it has only one-eighth the average density of earth but with its larger volume saturn is over 95 times more massive saturn is named after the roman god of agriculture its astronomical symbol represents the gods sickle saturns interior is probably composed of a core of ironnickel and rock silicon and oxygen compounds this core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally a gaseous outer layer saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to saturns planetary magnetic field which is weaker than earths but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of earth due to saturns larger size saturns magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of jupiters the outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast although long-lived features can appear wind speeds on saturn can reach 1800kmh 1100mph 500ms higher than on jupiter but not as high as those on neptune in january 2019 astronomers reported that a day on the planet saturn has been determined to be 103338 119 based on studies of the planets c ring the planets most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust at least 62 moons are known to orbit saturn of which 53 are officially named this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings titan saturns largest moon and the second-largest in the solar system is larger than the planet mercury although less massive and is the only moon in the solar system to have a substantial atmosphere physical characteristics saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium it lacks a definite surface though it may have a solid core saturns rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid that is it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10 60268km versus 54364km jupiter uranus and neptune the other giant planets in the solar system are also oblate but to a lesser extent the combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator 7000896000000000000896ms is 74 that at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of earth however the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 700436000000000000036kms is much higher than that for earth saturn is the only planet of the solar system that is less dense than waterabout 30 less although saturns core is considerably denser than water the average specific density of the planet is 7002690000000000000069gcm due to the atmosphere jupiter has 318 times earths mass and saturn is 95 times earths mass together jupiter and saturn hold 92 of the total planetary mass in the solar system internal structure despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium most of saturns mass is not in the gas phase because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 7001100000000000000001gcm which is reached at a radius containing 999 of saturns mass the temperature pressure and density inside saturn all rise steadily toward the core which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers standard planetary models suggest that the interior of saturn is similar to that of jupiter having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles this core is similar in composition to earth but more dense examination of saturns gravitational moment in combination with physical models of the interior has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of saturns core in 2004 scientists estimated that the core must be 922 times the mass of earth which corresponds to a diameter of about 25000km this is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude the outermost layer spans 1000km and consists of gas saturn has a hot interior reaching 11700c at its core and it radiates 25 times more energy into space than it receives from the sun jupiters thermal energy is generated by the kelvinhelmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for saturn because it is less massive an alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the raining out of droplets of helium deep in saturns interior as the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen the process releases heat by friction and leaves saturns outer layers depleted of helium these descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within saturn as well as in jupiter and ice giants uranus and neptune atmosphere the outer atmosphere of saturn contains 963 molecular hydrogen and 325 helium by volume the proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the sun the quantity of elements heavier than helium metallicity is not known precisely but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the solar system the total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 1931 times the mass of the earth with a significant fraction located in saturns core region trace amounts of ammonia acetylene ethane propane phosphine and methane have been detected in saturns atmosphere the upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide nh 4sh or water ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion this photochemical cycle is modulated by saturns annual seasonal cycle cloud layers saturns atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to jupiters but saturns bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator the nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on jupiter saturns finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the voyager spacecraft during the 1980s since then earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made the composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure in the upper cloud layers with the temperature in the range 100160k and pressures extending between 052 bar the clouds consist of ammonia ice water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 25 bar and extend down to 95 bar where temperatures range from 185270k intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice lying in the pressure range 36 bar with temperatures of 190235k finally the lower layers where pressures are between 1020 bar and temperatures are 270330k contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution saturns usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on jupiter in 1990 the hubble space telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near saturns equator that was not present during the voyager encounters and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed the 1990 storm was an example of a great white spot a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every saturnian year roughly every 30 earth years around the time of the northern hemispheres summer solstice previous great white spots were observed in 1876 1903 1933 and 1960 with the 1933 storm being the most famous if the periodicity is maintained another storm will occur in about 2020 the winds on saturn are the second fastest among the solar systems planets after neptunes voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of 500ms 1800kmh in images from the cassini spacecraft during 2007 saturns northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue similar to uranus the color was most likely caused by rayleigh scattering thermography has shown that saturns south pole has a warm polar vortex the only known example of such a phenomenon in the solar system whereas temperatures on saturn are normally 185c temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as 122c suspected to be the warmest spot on saturn north pole hexagonal cloud pattern a persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78n was first noted in the voyager images the sides of the hexagon are each about 13800km 8600mi long which is longer than the diameter of the earth the entire structure rotates with a period of 10h 39m 24s the same period as that of the planets radio emissions which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of saturns interior the hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere the patterns origin is a matter of much speculation most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids south pole vortex hst imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave nasa reported in november 2006 that cassini had observed a hurricane-like storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than earth for example images from the galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the great red spot of jupiter the south pole storm may have been present for billions of years this vortex is comparable to the size of earth and it has winds of 550kmh other features cassini observed a series of cloud features nicknamed string of pearls found in northern latitudes these features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers magnetosphere saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple symmetric shape a magnetic dipole its strength at the equator 02gauss 20t is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around jupiter and slightly weaker than earths magnetic field as a result saturns magnetosphere is much smaller than jupiters when voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 saturn radii or 11 million km 712000mi although it enlarged within several hours and remained so for about three days most probably the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of jupiter by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo this magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the sun the moon titan orbits within the outer part of saturns magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in titans outer atmosphere saturns magnetosphere like earths produces aurorae orbit and rotation the average distance between saturn and the sun is over 14 billion kilometers 9au with an average orbital speed of 968kms it takes saturn 10759 earth days or about 292years to finish one revolution around the sun as a consequence it forms a near 52 mean-motion resonance with jupiter the elliptical orbit of saturn is inclined 248 relative to the orbital plane of the earth the perihelion and aphelion distances are respectively 9195 and 9957au on average the visible features on saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions as in jupiters case astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of saturn systemi has a period of 10hr 14min 00sec 8443d and encompasses the equatorial zone the south equatorial belt and the north equatorial belt the polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to systemi all other saturnian latitudes excluding the north and south polar regions are indicated as systemii and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 254sec 81076d systemiii refers to saturns internal rotation rate based on radio emissions from the planet detected by voyager 1 and voyager 2 systemiii has a rotation period of 10hr 39min 224sec 8108d systemiii has largely superseded systemii a precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive while approaching saturn in 2004 cassini found that the radio rotation period of saturn had increased appreciably to approximately 10hr 45min 45sec 36sec the latest estimate of saturns rotation as an indicated rotation rate for saturn as a whole based on a compilation of various measurements from the cassini voyager and pioneer probes was reported in september 2007 is 10hr 32min 35sec in march 2007 it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match saturns rotation rate this variance may be caused by geyser activity on saturns moon enceladus the water vapor emitted into saturns orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon saturns magnetic field slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet an apparent oddity for saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids these are minor planets that orbit the sun at the stable lagrangian points designated l4 and l5 located at 60 angles to the planet along its orbit trojan asteroids have been discovered for mars jupiter uranus and neptune orbital resonance mechanisms including secular resonance are believed to be the cause of the missing saturnian trojans natural satellites saturn has 62 known moons 53 of which have formal names in addition there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40500 meters in saturns rings which are not considered to be true moons titan the largest moon comprises more than 90 of the mass in orbit around saturn including the rings saturns second-largest moon rhea may have a tenuous ring system of its own along with a tenuous atmosphere many of the other moons are small 34 are less than 10km in diameter and another 14 between 10 and 50km in diameter traditionally most of saturns moons have been named after titans of greek mythology titan is the only satellite in the solar system with a major atmosphere in which a complex organic chemistry occurs it is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes on 6 june 2013 scientists at the iaa-csic reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of titan a possible precursor for life on 23 june 2014 nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier times saturns moon enceladus which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life evidence of this possibility includes the satellites salt-rich particles having an ocean-like composition that indicates most of enceladuss expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water a 2015 flyby by cassini through a plume on enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis in april 2014 nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring which was imaged by cassini on 15 april 2013 planetary rings saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique the rings extend from 6630 to 120700 kilometers 4120 to 75000mi outward from saturns equator and average approximately 20 meters 66ft in thickness they are composed predominantly of water ice with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately 7 amorphous carbon the particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m while the other gas giants also have ring systems saturns is the largest and most visible there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings one hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of saturn the second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which saturn formed some ice in the e ring comes from the moon enceladuss geysers the water abundance of the rings vary radially with the outermost ring a being the most pure in ice water this abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment beyond the main rings at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse phoebe ring which is tilted at an angle of 27 to the other rings and like phoebe orbits in retrograde fashion some of the moons of saturn including pandora and prometheus act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out pan and atlas cause weak linear density waves in saturns rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses history of observation and exploration the observation and exploration of saturn can be divided into three main phases the first era was ancient observations such as with the naked eye before the invention of the modern telescopes starting in the 17th century progressively more advanced telescopic observations from earth have been made the third phase is visitation by space probes by either orbiting or flyby in the 21st century observations continue from earth including earth-orbiting observatories like the hubble space telescope and until its 2017 retirement from the cassini orbiter around saturn ancient observations saturn has been known since prehistoric times and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of saturn in ancient greek the planet was known as phainon and in roman times it was known as the star of saturn in ancient roman mythology the planet phainon was sacred to this agricultural god from which the planet takes its modern name the romans considered the god saturnus the equivalent of the greek god cronus in modern greek the planet retains the name cronus kronos the greek scientist ptolemy based his calculations of saturns orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition in hindu astrology there are nine astrological objects known as navagrahas saturn is known as shani and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life ancient chinese and japanese culture designated the planet saturn as the earth star this was based on five elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements in ancient hebrew saturn is called shabbathai its angel is cassiel its intelligence or beneficial spirit is agl hebrew translitagyal and its darker spirit demon is zzl hebrew translitzazl zazel has been described as a great angel invoked in solomonic magic who is effective in love conjurations in ottoman turkish urdu and malay the name of zazel is zuhal derived from the arabic language arabic translitzuhal european observations 17th19th centuries saturns rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope to resolve and thus were not known to exist until galileo first saw them in 1610 he thought of them as two moons on saturns sides it was not until christiaan huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted huygens discovered saturns moon titan giovanni domenico cassini later discovered four other moons iapetus rhea tethys and dione in 1675 cassini discovered the gap now known as the cassini division no further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when william herschel discovered two further moons mimas and enceladus the irregularly shaped satellite hyperion which has a resonance with titan was discovered in 1848 by a british team in 1899 william henry pickering discovered phoebe a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with saturn as the larger moons do phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit saturn in a retrograde orbit during the early 20th century research on titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere a feature unique among the solar systems moons modern nasa and esa probes pioneer 11 flyby pioneer 11 made the first flyby of saturn in september 1979 when it passed within 20000km of the planets cloud tops images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail the spacecraft also studied saturns rings revealing the thin f-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle towards the sun meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material in addition pioneer 11 measured the temperature of titan voyager flybys in november 1980 the voyager 1 probe visited the saturn system it sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet its rings and satellites surface features of various moons were seen for the first time voyager 1 performed a close flyby of titan increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon it proved that titans atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths therefore no surface details were seen the flyby changed the spacecrafts trajectory out from the plane of the solar system almost a year later in august 1981 voyager 2 continued the study of the saturn system more close-up images of saturns moons were acquired as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings unfortunately during the flyby the probes turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost saturns gravity was used to direct the spacecrafts trajectory towards uranus the probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planets rings as well as the small maxwell gap a gap within the c ring and keeler gap a 42km wide gap in the a ring cassinihuygens spacecraft the cassinihuygens space probe entered orbit around saturn on 1 july 2004 in june 2004 it conducted a close flyby of phoebe sending back high-resolution images and data cassinis flyby of saturns largest moon titan captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains the orbiter completed two titan flybys before releasing the huygens probe on 25 december 2004 huygens descended onto the surface of titan on 14 january 2005 starting in early 2005 scientists used cassini to track lightning on saturn the power of the lightning is approximately 1000times that of lightning on earth in 2006 nasa reported that cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on saturns moon enceladus these jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around saturn from vents in the moons south polar region over 100 geysers have been identified on enceladus in may 2011 nasa scientists reported that enceladus is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond earth in the solar system for life as we know it cassini photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring outside the brighter main rings of saturn and inside the g and erings the source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off janus and epimetheus in july 2006 images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near titans north pole the presence of which were confirmed in january 2007 in march 2007 hydrocarbon seas were found near the north pole the largest of which is almost the size of the caspian sea in october 2006 the probe detected an 8000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at saturns south pole from 2004 to 2 november 2009 the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites in april 2013 cassini sent back images of a hurricane at the planets north pole 20 times larger than those found on earth with winds faster than 530kmh 330mph on 15 september 2017 the cassini-huygens spacecraft performed the grand finale of its mission a number of passes through gaps between saturn and saturns inner rings the atmospheric entry of cassini ended the mission possible future missions the continued exploration of saturn is still considered to be a viable option for nasa as part of their ongoing new frontiers program of missions nasa previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on saturns moons titan and enceladus observation saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from earth the other four being mercury venus mars and jupiter uranus and occasionally 4 vesta are visible to the naked eye in dark skies saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright yellowish point of light the mean apparent magnitude of saturn is 046 with a standard deviation of 034 most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the sun and earth the brightest magnitude -055 occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly and the faintest magnitude 117 occurs around the time when they are least inclined it takes approximately 295 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac most people will require an optical aid very large binoculars or a small telescope that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of saturns rings in which clear resolution is present twice every saturnian year roughly every 15 earth years the rings briefly disappear from view due to the way in which they are angled and because they are so thin such a disappearance will next occur in 2025 but saturn will be too close to the sun for any ring-crossing observation to be possible saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at or near opposition the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180 and thus appears opposite the sun in the sky a saturnian opposition occurs every yearapproximately every 378 daysand results in the planet appearing at its brightest both the earth and saturn orbit the sun on eccentric orbits which means their distances from the sun vary over time and therefore so do their distances from each other hence varying the brightness of saturn from one opposition to the next saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible for example during the opposition of 17 december 2002 saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the earth even though saturn was closer to the earth and sun in late 2003 from time to time saturn is occulted by the moon that is the moon covers up saturn in the sky as with all the planets in the solar system occultations of saturn occur in seasons saturnian occultations will take place 12 or more times over a 12-month period followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered australian astronomy experts hill and horner explain the seasonal nature of saturnian occultations this is the result of the fact that the moons orbit around the earth is tilted to the orbit of the earth around the sun and so most of the time the moon will pass above or below saturn in the sky and no occultation will occur it is only when saturn lies near the point that the moons orbit crosses the plane of the ecliptic that occultations can happen and then they occur every time the moon swings by until saturn moves away from the crossing point notes alexander arthur francis odonel 1980 1962 the planet saturn - a history
