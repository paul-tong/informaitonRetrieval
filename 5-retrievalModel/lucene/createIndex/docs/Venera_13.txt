venera 13 russian -13 meaning venus 13 was a probe in the soviet venera program for the exploration of venus venera 13 and 14 were identical spacecraft built to take advantage of the 1981 venus launch opportunity and launched 5 days apart venera 13 on 30 october 1981 at 0604 utc and venera 14 on 4 november 1981 at 0531 utc both with an on-orbit dry mass of 760kg 1680lb design each mission consisted of a cruise stage and an attached descent craft cruise stage as the cruise stage flew by venus the bus acted as a data relay for the lander and then continued on into a heliocentric orbit it was equipped with a gamma-ray spectrometer uv grating monochromator electron and proton spectrometers gamma-ray burst detectors solar wind plasma detectors and two-frequency transmitters which made measurements before during and after the venus flyby descent lander the descent lander was a hermetically-sealed pressure vessel which contained most of the instrumentation and electronics mounted on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna the design was similar to the earlier venera 912 landers it carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight and record electric discharges during its descent phase through the venusian atmosphere the spacecraft utilized a camera system an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer a screw drill and surface sampler a dynamic penetrometer and a seismometer to conduct investigations on the surface list of lander experiments and instruments accelerometer impact analysis -
