period of major reform in french colonial policy congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within aef and the federal capital at brazzaville it also received a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the fourth republic following the revision of the french constitution that established the fifth republic in 1958 the aef dissolved into its constituent parts each of which became an autonomous colony within the french community during these reforms middle

regions centered on the ouesso district of the sangha region they suggest a population on the order of 125000 western lowland gorillas whose isolation from humans has been largely preserved by inhospitable swamps economy the economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts an industrial sector based largely on petroleum support services and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing petroleum extraction has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy in 2008 oil sector accounted for 65 of the gdp 85 of government revenue and 92 of exports the country also has large untapped mineral wealth in the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with gdp growth averaging 5 annually one of the highest rates in africa the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its petroleum earnings contributing to a shortage of revenues 12january1994 devaluation of franc zone currencies by 50 resulted in inflation of 46 in 1994 but inflation has subsided since economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations notably the world bank and the international monetary fund the reform program came to a halt in june 1997 when civil war erupted when sassou nguesso returned to power at the end of the war in october 1997 he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions however economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in december 1998 which worsened the republics budget deficit the current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic problems of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty despite record-high oil prices since 2003 natural gas and diamonds are also recent major congolese exports although congo was excluded from the kimberley process in 2004 amid allegations that most of its diamond exports were in fact being smuggled out of the neighboring democratic republic of the congo it was re-admitted to the group in 2007

pointe-noire and others along the congo river at brazzaville and impfondo demographics religion in the republic of the congo by pew research center 2011 the republic of the congos sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country leaving the vast areas of tropical jungle in the north virtually uninhabited thus congo is one of the most urbanized countries in africa with 70 of its total population living in a few urban areas namely in brazzaville pointe-noire or one of the small cities or villages lining the 534-kilometre 332mi railway which connects the two cities in rural areas industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence ethnically and linguistically the population of the republic of the congo is diverseethnologue recognises 62 spoken languages in the countrybut can be grouped into three categories the kongo are the largest ethnic group and form roughly half of the population the most significant subgroups of the kongo are laari in brazzaville and pool regions and vili around pointe-noire and along the atlantic coast the second largest group are the teke who live to the north of brazzaville with 17 of the population boulangui mboshi live in the northwest and in brazzaville and form 12 of the population pygmies make up 2 of congos population before the 1997 war about 9000 europeans and other non-africans lived in congo most of whom were french only a fraction of this number remains around 300 american expatriates reside in the congo according to cia world factbook the people of the republic of the congo are largely a mix of catholics 331 awakening lutherans 223 and other protestants 199 followers of islam make up 16 and this is primarily due to an influx of foreign workers into the urban centers according to a 201112 survey total fertility rate was 51 children born per woman with 45 in urban areas and 65 in rural areas health public expenditure health was at 89 of the gdp in 2004 whereas private expenditure was at 13 as of 2012 the hivaids prevalence was at 28 among 15- to 49-year-olds health expenditure was at us30 per capita in 2004 a large proportion of the population is undernourished with malnutrition being a problem in congo-brazzaville there were 20 physicians per 100000 persons in the early 2000s decade as of 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 560 deaths100000 live births and the infant mortality rate was 5934 deaths1000 live births female genital mutilation fgm is rare in the country being confined to limited geographic areas of the country culture the congolese culture has been influenced by a wide variety of natural landscapes stretching from the savannah plains in the north niari flooded forests to the great congo river to rugged mountains and forest of mayombe and including 170km of beaches along the atlantic coast the presence of numerous ethnic groups and various political structures once kongo empire kingdom of loango kingdom teke northern chiefdoms provided an enormous amount of diversity in the traditional cultures as well as in many ancient artistic expressions vili nail fetishes bembe statuettes which are very expressive despite their small size the strange masks of the punu and kwele reliquaries kinabalu teke fetishes curious cemeteries with their monumental tombs and the lari country are all such features the congolese also have a considerable colonial architectural heritage which they are rediscovering today as part of their ancestry and their tourist capital they are also taking great pains to restore these artefacts at least in brazzaville tourism remains a very marginal resource in the congo reception facilities based out of pointe-noire and brazzaville lack a sufficient and consistent communications network many sites are difficult to visit but paradoxically some of the souths most populous and developed locations are often the least accessible for example the massive chaillu mountains are almost impossible to visit many congolese singers have carried the countrys image to the furthest reaches of the globe the franco-congolese rapper passi playing in france to whom we owe the release of several hit albums to like the temptations with the famous song i zap and i mate without forgetting the mpassi singer of the former group melgroove rappers calbo of arsenik group ben j of neg marrons mystic rcfa the group bisso na bisso and casimir zao the republic of congo has several writers recognised in africa and the french-speaking world alain mabanckou jean-baptiste tati loutard jeannette ballou tchichelle henri lopes lassy mbouity and tchicaya u tamsi other artistic genres such as movies often struggle to make breakthroughs after a promising start in the 1970s the troubled political situation and the closure of cinemas made production difficult the country produces no feature film each year and generally the filmmakers directly broadcast their video production unfortunately congolese culture art and media has remained a poor investment due to the various successive governments creating instability
