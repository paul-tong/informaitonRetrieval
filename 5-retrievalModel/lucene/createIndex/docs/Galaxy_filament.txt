in physical cosmology galaxy filaments subtypes supercluster complexes galaxy walls and galaxy sheets are the largest known structures in the universe they are massive thread-like formations with a typical length of 50 to 80 megaparsecs h 163 to 261 million light-years that form the boundaries between large voids in the universe filaments consist of gravitationally bound galaxies parts wherein many galaxies are very close to one another in cosmic terms are called superclusters formation in the standard model of the evolution of the universe galactic filaments form along and follow web-like strings of dark matter it is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the universe on the grandest of scales dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter and it is this normal matter that astronomers see forming long thin walls of super-galactic clusters discovery discovery of structures larger than superclusters began in the late-1980s in 1987 astronomer r brent tully of the university of hawaiis institute of astronomy identified what he called the piscescetus supercluster complex in 1989 the cfa2 great wall was discovered followed by the sloan great wall in 2003 on january 11 2013 researchers led by roger clowes of the university of central lancashire announced the discovery of a large quasar group the huge-lqg which dwarfs previously discovered galaxy filaments in size in november 2013 using gamma-ray bursts as reference points astronomers discovered the herculescorona borealis great wall an extremely huge filament measuring more than 10 billion light-years across filaments filament subtype of filaments have roughly similar major and minor axes in cross-section along the lengthwise axis a short filament detected by identifying an alignment of star-forming galaxies in the neighborhood of the milky way and the local group was proposed by adi zitrin and noah brosch the reality of this filament and the identification of a similar but shorter filament were the result of a study by mcquinn et al 2014 based on distance measurements using the trgb method galaxy walls the galaxy wall subtype of filaments have a significantly greater major axis than minor axis in cross-section along the lengthwise axis a centaurus great wall or fornax great wall or virgo great wall has been proposed which would include the fornax wall as a portion of it visually created by the zone of avoidance along with the centaurus supercluster and the virgo supercluster also known as our local supercluster within which the milky way galaxy is located implying this to be the local great wall a wall was proposed to be the physical embodiment of the great attractor with the norma cluster as part of it it is sometimes referred to as the great attractor wall or norma wall this suggestion was superseded by the proposal of a supercluster laniakea that would encompass the great attractor virgo supercluster hydra-centaurus superclusters a wall was proposed in 2000 to lie at z147 in the vicinity of radio galaxy b3 0003387 a wall was proposed in 2000 to lie at z0559 in the northern hubble deep field hdf north map of nearest galaxy walls large quasar groups large quasar groups lqgs are some of the largest structures known they are theorized to be protohyperclustersproto-supercluster-complexesgalaxy filament precursors supercluster complex maps of large-scale distribution the universe within 1 billion light-years 307 mpc of earth showing local superclusters forming filaments and voids the universe within 1 billion light-years 307 mpc of earth showing local superclusters forming filaments and voids map of nearest walls voids and superclusters map of nearest walls voids and superclusters 2df survey map containing the sdss great wall 2df survey map containing the sdss great wall 2mass xsc infrared sky map 2mass xsc infrared sky map see also list of largest cosmic structures galaxy galaxy cluster galaxy supercluster illustris project large-scale structure list of galaxies list of galaxy groups and clusters void astronomy kevin a pimbblet pulling out threads from the cosmic tapestry defining filaments of galaxies pdf arxiv 14 march 2005 pictures of the filamentary network the universe within one billion light years with list of nearby superclusters from the atlas of the universe
