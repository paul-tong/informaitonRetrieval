of the international date line tuvalu has a population of 10640 2012 census the total land area of the islands of tuvalu is 26 square kilometres 10sqmi the first inhabitants of tuvalu were polynesians the pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the polynesians spread out from samoa and tonga into the tuvaluan atolls with tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the polynesian outlier communities in melanesia and micronesia in 1568 spanish navigator lvaro de mendaa was the first european to sail through the archipelago sighting the island of nui during his expedition in search of terra australis the island of funafuti was named ellices island in 1819 the name ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of english hydrographer alexander george findlay the ellice islands came into great britains sphere of influence in the late 19th century as the result of a treaty between great britain and germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the pacific ocean each of the ellice islands was declared a british protectorate by captain gibson of hmscuracoa between 9 and 16 october 1892 the ellice islands were administered as a british protectorate by a resident commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the british western pacific territories bwpt and then as part of the gilbert and ellice islands colony from 1916 to 1976 a referendum was held in december 1974 to determine whether the gilbert islands and ellice islands should each have their own administration as a consequence of the referendum the gilbert and ellice islands colony ceased to exist on 1 january 1976 and the separate british colonies of kiribati and tuvalu came into existence tuvalu became fully independent within the commonwealth on 1 october 1978 on 5 september 2000 tuvalu became the 189th member of the united nations history pre-history the origins of the people of tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the pacific that began about 3000 years ago during pre-european-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including samoa and tonga eight of the nine islands of tuvalu were inhabited thus the name tuvalu means eight standing together in tuvaluan compare to walo meaning eight in proto-austronesian possible evidence of fire in the caves of nanumanga may indicate human occupation for thousands of years an important creation myth of the islands of tuvalu is the story of the te pusi mo te ali the eel and the flounder who created the islands of tuvalu te ali the flounder is believed to be the origin of the flat atolls of tuvalu and the te pusin the eel is the model for the coconut palms that are important in the lives of tuvaluans the stories as to the ancestors of the tuvaluans vary from island to island on niutao funafuti and vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from samoa whereas on nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from tonga early contacts with other cultures tuvalu was first sighted by europeans on 16 january 1568 during the voyage of lvaro de mendaa from spain who sailed past nui and charted it as isla de jess spanish for island of jesus because the previous day was the feast of the holy name mendaa made contact with the islanders but was unable to land during mendaas second voyage across the pacific he passed niulakita on 29 august 1595 which he named la solitaria captain john byron passed through the islands of tuvalu in 1764 during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the dolphin1751 he charted the atolls as lagoon islands keith s chambers and doug munro 1980 identified niutao as the island that francisco mourelle de la ra sailed past on 5 may 1781 thus solving what europeans had called the mystery of gran cocal mourelles map and journal named the island el gran cocal the great coconut plantation however the latitude and longitude was uncertain longitude could only be reckoned crudely at the time as accurate chronometers only became available in the late 18th century the next european to visit was arent schuyler de peyster of new york captain of the armed brigantine or privateer rebecca sailing under british colours which passed through the southern tuvaluan waters in may 1819 de peyster sighted nukufetau and funafuti which he named ellices island after an english politician edward ellice the member of parliament for coventry and the owner of the rebeccas cargo the name ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of english hydrographer alexander george findlay in 1820 the russian explorer mikhail lazarev visited nukufetau as commander of the mirny louis isidore duperrey captain of la coquille sailed past nanumanga in may 1824 during a circumnavigation of the earth 18221825 a dutch expedition the frigate maria reigersberg found nui on the morning of 14 june 1825 and named the main island fenua tapu as nederlandsch eiland whalers began roving the pacific although they visited tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls captain george barrett of the nantucket whaler independence ii has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around tuvalu he bartered coconuts from the people of nukulaelae in november 1821 and also visited niulakita a shore camp was established on sakalua islet of nukufetau where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber for less than a year between 1862 and 1863 peruvian ships engaged in the so-called blackbirding trade combed the smaller islands of polynesia from easter island in the eastern pacific to tuvalu and the southern atolls of the gilbert islands now kiribati seeking recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in peru while some islanders were voluntary recruits the blackbirders were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks such as pretending to be christian missionaries as well as kidnapping islanders at gunpoint the rev a w murray the earliest european missionary in tuvalu reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from funafuti and about 250 were taken from nukulaelae as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on nukulaelae christianity came to tuvalu in 1861 when elekana a deacon of a congregational church in manihiki cook islands became caught in a storm and

before beginning his work in establishing the church of tuvalu in 1865 the rev a w murray of the lms a protestant congregationalist missionary society arrived as the first european missionary where he

fenisot nukufetau and martin kleis nui during this time the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls acting as agents for the trading companies some islands would have competing traders while dryer islands might only have a single trader in the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century structural changes occurred in the operation of the pacific trading companies they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo the cargo manager of a trading ship would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island from 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in tuvalu declined the last of them were fred whibley on niutao alfred restieaux on nukufetau and martin kleis on nui by 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies although whibley restieaux and kleis remained in the islands until their deaths scientific expeditions and travellers the

seafood provides protein bananas and breadfruit are supplemental crops coconut is used for its juice to make other beverages and to improve the taste of some dishes a 1560-square-metre pond was built in 1996 on vaitupu to sustain aquaculture in tuvalu flying fish are caught as a source of food and as an exciting activity using a boat a butterfly net and a spotlight to attract the flying fish heritage the traditional community system still survives to a large extent on tuvalu each family has its own task or salanga to perform for the community such as fishing house building or defence the skills of a family are passed on from parents to children most islands have their own fusi community owned shops similar to convenience stores where canned foods and bags of rice can be purchased goods are cheaper and fusis give better prices for their own produce another important building is the falekaupule or maneapa the traditional island meeting hall where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities such as a fatele involving music singing and dancing falekaupule is also used as the name of the council of elders the traditional decision making body on each island under the falekaupule act falekaupule means traditional assembly in each islandcomposed in accordance with the aganu of each island aganu means traditional customs and culture sport and leisure a traditional sport played in tuvalu is kilikiti which is similar to cricket a popular sport specific to tuvalu is ano which is played with two round balls of 12cm 5in diameter ano is a localised version of volleyball in which the two hard balls made from pandanus leaves are volleyed at great speed with the team members trying to stop the ano hitting the ground traditional sports in the late 19th century were foot racing lance throwing quarterstaff fencing and wrestling although the christian missionaries disapproved of these activities the popular sports in tuvalu include kilikiti ano association football futsal volleyball handball basketball and rugby union tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics badminton tennis table tennis volleyball football basketball rugby union weightlifting and powerlifting at the 2013 pacific mini games tuau lapua lapua won tuvalus first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch he also won bronze in the clean and jerk and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event in 2015 telupe iosefa received the first gold medal won by tuvalu at the pacific games in the powerlifting 120kg male division football in tuvalu is played at club and national team level the tuvalu national football team trains at the tuvalu sports ground in funafuti and competes in the pacific games the tuvalu national football association is an associate member of the oceania football confederation ofc and is seeking membership in fifa the tuvalu national futsal team participates in the oceanian futsal championship a major sporting event is the independence day sports festival held annually on 1 october the most important sports event within the country is arguably the tuvalu games which are held yearly since 2008 tuvalu first participated in the pacific games in 1978 and in the commonwealth games in 1998 when a weightlifter attended the games held at kuala lumpur malaysia two table tennis players attended the 2002 commonwealth games in manchester england tuvalu entered competitors in shooting table tennis and weightlifting at the 2006 commonwealth games in melbourne australia three athletes participated in the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi india entering the discus shot put and weightlifting events and a team of 3 weightlifters and 2 table tennis players attended the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow tuvaluan athletes have also participated in the mens and womens 100 metres sprint at the world championships in athletics from 2009 the tuvalu association of sports and national olympic committee tasnoc was recognised as a national olympic committee in july 2007 tuvalu entered the olympic games for the first time at the 2008 summer games in beijing china with a weightlifter and two athletes in the mens and womens 100 metres sprint a team with athletes in the same events represented tuvalu at the 2012 summer olympics etimoni timuani was the sole representative of tuvalu at the 2016 summer olympics in the 100m event economy and government services economy from 1996 to 2002 tuvalu was one of the best-performing pacific island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product gdp growth rate of 56 per annum economic growth slowed after 2002 with gdp growth of 15 in 2008 tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008 with the level of inflation peaking at 134 tuvalu joined the international monetary fund imf on 24 june 2010 the imp 2010 report on tuvalu estimates that tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 gdp after the economy contracted by about 2 in 2009 on 5 august 2012 the executive board of the imf concluded the article iv consultation with tuvalu and assessed the economy of tuvalu a slow recovery is underway in tuvalu but there are important risks gdp grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis led by the private retail sector and education spending we expect growth to rise slowly the imf 2014 country report noted that real gdp growth in tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade the 2014 country report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licences together with substantial foreign aid while a budget deficit of a04million was projected for 2015 the asian development bank adb assessed the budget as being a143m in surplus as the result of high tuna fish licence fees the adb predicted that the 2 growth rate for 2015 would continue into 2016 nonetheless tuvalu has the smallest gdp of any sovereign nation in the world the government is the primary provider of medical services through princess margaret hospital on funafuti which operates health clinics on the other islands banking services are provided by the national bank of tuvalu public sector workers make up about 65 of those formally employed remittances from tuvaluans living in australia and new zealand and remittances from tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships are important sources of income for tuvaluans approximately 15 of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships agriculture in tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing tuvaluans are well known for their seafaring skills with the tuvalu maritime training institute on amatuku motu island funafuti providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so that they have the skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping the tuvalu overseas seamens union tosu is the only registered trade union in tuvalu it represents workers on foreign ships the asian development bank adb estimates that 800 tuvaluan men are trained certified and active as seafarers the adb estimates that at any one time about 15 of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boats tuna fishing licence government revenues largely come from sales of fishing licences income from the tuvalu trust fund and from the lease of its tv internet top level domain tld in 1998 tuvalu began deriving revenue from the use of its area code for premium-rate telephone numbers and from the commercialisation of its tv internet domain name which is now managed by verisign until 2021 tuvalu also generates income from postage stamps by the tuvalu philatelic bureau and from the tuvalu ship registry the tuvalu trust fund was established in 1987 by the united kingdom australia and new zealand the value of the tuvalu trust fund is approximately 100million financial support to tuvalu is also provided by japan south korea and the european union australia and new zealand continue to contribute capital to the tuvalu trust fund and provide other forms of development assistance the us government is also a major revenue source for tuvalu in 1999 the payment from the south pacific tuna treaty sptt was about 9million with the value increasing in the following years in may 2013 representatives from the united states and the pacific islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the multilateral fisheries treaty which encompasses the south pacific tuna treaty for 18 months the united nations designates tuvalu as a least developed country ldc because of its limited potential for economic development absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks tuvalu participates in the enhanced integrated framework for trade-related technical assistance to least developed countries eif which was established in october 1997 under the auspices of the world trade organisation in 2013 tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country ldc status to a developing country to 2015 prime minister enele sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by tuvalu to the funds provided by the united nationss national adaptation programme of action napa as once tuvalu graduates to a developed country it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like napa which only goes to ldcs tuvalu had met targets so that tuvalu was to graduate from ldc status prime minister enele sopoaga wants the united nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from ldc status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like tuvalu in the application of the environmental vulnerability index evi tourism due to the countrys remoteness tourism is not significant visitors totalled 1684 in 2010 65 were on business development officials or technical consultants 20 were tourists 360 people and 11 were expatriates returning to visit family in 2016 the number of visitors had increased to 2000 the main island of funafuti is the focus of travellers since the only airport in tuvalu is the funafuti international airport and the island has hotel facilities ecotourism is a motivation of travellers to tuvalu the funafuti conservation area consists of 1274 square miles 3300 square kilometres of ocean reef lagoon channel and six uninhabited islets the outer atolls can be visited on the two passenger-cargo ships nivaga iii and man folau which provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks there is guesthouse accommodation on many of the outer islands telecommunications and media the tuvalu media department of the government of tuvalu operates radio tuvalu which broadcasts from funafuti in 2011 the japanese government provided financial support to construct a new am broadcast studio the installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows radio tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of tuvalu the new am radio transmitter on funafuti replaced the fm radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services fenui news from tuvalu is a free digital publication of the tuvalu media department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a facebook page which publishes news about government activities and news about tuvaluan events the tuvalu telecommunications corporation ttc a state-owned enterprise provides fixed line telephone communications to subscribers on each island mobile phone services on funafuti vaitupu and nukulaelae and is a distributor of the fiji television service sky pacific satellite television service communications in tuvalu rely on satellite dishes for telephone and internet access the available bandwidth is only 512 kbits uplink and 15 mbits downlink throughout tuvalu are more than 900 subscribers who want to use the satellite service with demand slowing down the speed of the system transport transport services in tuvalu are limited there are about eight kilometres 5 miles of roads the streets of funafuti were paved in mid-2002 but other roads are unpaved tuvalu is among a few countries that do not have railroads funafuti is the only port but there is a deep-water berth in the lagoon at nukufetau the merchant marine fleet consists of two passengercargo ships nivaga iii and manu folau the nivaga iii and manu folau provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks and travel between suva fiji and funafuti three or four times a year the manu folau a 50-metre vessel was a gift from japan to the people of tuvalu in 2015 the united nations development program undp assisted the government of tuvalu to acquire mv talamoana a 30-metre vessel that will be used to implement tuvalus national adaptation programme of action napa to transport government officials and project personnel to the outer islands in 2015 the nivaga iii was donated by the government of japan it replaced the nivaga ii which had serviced tuvalu from 1989 the only airport in tuvalu is funafuti international airport it is a tarred strip fiji airways the owner of fiji airlines trading as fiji link operates services three times a week tuesday thursday and saturday between suva originating from nadi and funafuti with atr 72600 a 68-seat plane air kiribati service provides one flight a week to funafuti from tarawa on a wednesday the service uses a bombardier dash 8 100 series aircraft which has the capacity to take up to 35 passengers geography and environment geography tuvalu is a volcanic archipelago and consists of three reef islands nanumanga niutao and niulakita and six true atolls funafuti nanumea nui nukufetau nukulaelae and vaitupu its small scattered group of atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres 10 square miles making it the fourth smallest country in the world over four decades there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 735ha 29 although the changes are not uniform with 74 increasing and 27 decreasing in size the sea level at the funafuti tide gauge has risen at 39mm per year which is approximately twice the global average the rising sea levels are identified as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across reef surfaces which shifts sand resulting in accretion to island shorelines although this process does not result in additional habitable land funafuti is the largest atoll and comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 251 kilometres 156 miles ns by 184 kilometres 114 miles w-e centred on 1797e and 830s on the atolls an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with several natural reef channels surveys were carried out in may 2010 of the reef habitats of nanumea nukulaelae and funafuti a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this tuvalu marine life study the surveys identified 66 species that had not previously been recorded in tuvalu which brings the total number of identified species to 607 tuvalus exclusive economic zone eez covers an oceanic area of approximately 900000km climate tuvalu experiences two distinct seasons a wet season from november to april and a dry season from may to october westerly gales and heavy rain are the predominant weather conditions from october to march the period that is known as tau-o-lalo with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from april to november tuvalu experiences the effects of el nio and la nia which is caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central pacific el nio effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones while la nia effects increase the chances of drought typically the islands of tuvalu receive between 200 to 400mm 8 to 16in of rainfall per month however in 2011 a weak la nia effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around tuvalu a state of emergency was declared on 28 september 2011 with rationing of fresh water on the islands of funafuti and nukulaelae households on funafuti and nukulaelae were restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day 40 litres the governments of australia and new zealand responded to the 2011 fresh water crisis by supplying temporary desalination plants and assisted in the repair of the existing desalination unit that was donated by japan in 2006 in response to the 2011 drought japan funded the purchase of a 100 md desalination plant and two portable 10 md plants as part of its pacific environment community pec program aid programs from the european union and australia also provided water tanks as part of a longer-term solution for the storage of available fresh water the la nia event that caused the drought ended in aprilmay 2012 the central pacific ocean experiences changes from periods of la nia to periods of el nio environmental pressures the eastern shoreline of funafuti lagoon on fongafale was modified during world war ii when the airfield now funafuti international airport was constructed the coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway the resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer in the low-lying areas of funafuti the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide in 2014 the tuvalu borrow pits remediation bpr project was approved so that 10 borrow pits would be filled with sand from the lagoon leaving tafua pond which is a natural pond the new zealand government funded the bpr project the project was carried out in 2015 with 365000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island this project increased the usable land space on fongafale by eight per cent during world war ii several piers were also constructed on fongafale in the funafuti lagoon beach areas were filled and deep-water access channels were excavated these alterations to the reef and shoreline resulted in changes to wave patterns with less sand accumulating to form the beaches compared to former times the shoreline is now exposed to wave action several attempts to stabilise the shoreline have not achieved the desired effect the reefs at funafuti have suffered damage with 80 percent of the coral becoming bleached as a consequence of the increase in ocean temperatures and ocean acidification the coral bleaching which includes staghorn corals is attributed to the increase in water temperature that happened during the el nios that occurred between 1998 and 2001 a reef restoration project has investigated reef restoration techniques and researchers from japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of foraminifera the project of the japan international cooperation agency is designed to increase the resilience of the tuvalu coast against sea level rise through ecosystem rehabilitation and regeneration and through support for sand production the rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks which are under stress although the creation of the funafuti conservation area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the funafuti lagoon population pressure on the resources of funafuti and inadequate sanitation systems have resulted in pollution the waste operations and services act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the european union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems the environment protection litter and waste control regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials plastic waste is a problem in tuvalu for much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging water and sanitation rainwater harvesting is the principal source of fresh water in tuvalu nukufetau vaitupu and nanumea are the only islands with sustainable groundwater supplies the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting is diminished because of poor maintenance of roofs gutters and pipes aid programmes of australia and the european union have been directed to improving the storage capacity on funafuti and in the outer islands reverse osmosis ro desalination units supplement rainwater harvesting on funafuti the 65 m desalination plant operates at a real production level of around 40 m per day ro water is only intended to be produced when storage falls below 30 however demand to replenish household storage supplies with tanker-delivered water means that the ro desalination units are continually operating water is delivered at a cost of a350 per m cost of production and delivery has been estimated at a6 per m with the difference subsidised by the government in july 2012 a united nations special rapporteur called on the tuvalu government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation in 2012 tuvalu developed a national water resources policy under the integrated water resource management iwrm project and the pacific adaptation to climate change pacc project which are sponsored by the global environment fundsopac government water planning has established a target of between 50 and 100l of water per person per day accounting for drinking water cleaning community and cultural activities tuvalu is working with the south pacific applied geoscience commission sopac to implement composting toilets and to improve the treatment of sewage sludge from septic tanks on fongafale for septic tanks are leaking into the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll as well as the ocean and lagoon composting toilets reduce water use by up to 30 cyclones and king tides cyclones because of the low elevation the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise a warning system which uses the iridium satellite network was introduced in 2016 in order to allow outlying islands to be better prepared for natural disasters the highest elevation is 46 metres 15ft above sea level on niulakita tuvalu thus has the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country after the maldives the highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones as occurred with cyclone bebe which was a very early-season storm that passed through the tuvaluan atolls in october 1972 cyclone bebe submerged funafuti eliminating 90 of structures on the island sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the systems storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water george westbrook a trader on funafuti recorded a cyclone that struck funafuti in 1883 a cyclone caused severe damage to the islands in 1894 tuvalu experienced an average of three cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s however eight occurred in the 1980s the impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides funafutis tepuka vili vili islet was devastated by cyclone meli in 1979 with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later severe tropical cyclone ofa had a major impact on tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops cyclone gavin was first identified during 2 march 1997 and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect tuvalu during the 199697 cyclone season with cyclones hina and keli following later in the season in march 2015 the winds and storm surge created by cyclone pam resulted in waves of 3 metres 98ft to 5 metres 16ft breaking over the reef of the outer islands causing damage to houses crops and infrastructure a state of emergency was declared on nui the sources of fresh water were destroyed or contaminated the flooding in nui and nukufetau caused many families to shelter in evacuation centres or with other families nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands nui nukufetau and vaitupu with both nui and nukufetau suffering the loss of 90 of the crops of the three northern islands nanumanga niutao and nanumea nanumanga suffered the most damage with from 60 to 100 houses flooded with the waves also causing damage to the health facility vasafua islet part of the funafuti conservation area was severely damaged by cyclone pam the coconut palms were washed away leaving the islet as a sand bar the tuvalu government carried out assessments of the damage caused by cyclone pam to the islands and has provided medical aid food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris government and non-government organisations provided assistance technical funding and material support to tuvalu to assist with recovery including who unicef undp ocha world bank dfat new zealand red cross ifrc fiji national university and governments of new zealand netherlands uae taiwan and the united states king tides tuvalu is also affected by perigean spring tide events which raise the sea level higher than a normal high tide the highest peak tide recorded by the tuvalu meteorological service is 34 metres 11ft on 24 february 2006 and again on 19 february 2015 as a result of the historical sea level rise the king tide events lead to flooding of low-lying areas which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by la nia effects or local storms and waves impact of climate change challenges tuvalu faces as a result of climate change as low-lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf the communities of tuvalu are especially susceptible to changes in sea level and undissipated storms at its highest tuvalu is only 46 metres 15ft above sea level tuvaluan leaders have been concerned about the effects of rising sea levels it is estimated that a sea level rise of 2040 centimetres 816 inches in the next 100 years could make tuvalu uninhabitable a recent study published in 2018 estimated the change in land area of tuvalus nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014 75 of the islands had grown with an overall increase in land area of more than 2 whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of tuvalu is a contentious issue there were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis the degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of tuvalu was reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data the uncertainty as to the accuracy of the data from this tide gauge resulted in a modern aquatrak acoustic gauge being installed in 1993 by the australian national tidal facility ntf as part of the ausaid-sponsored south pacific sea level and climate monitoring project the 2011 report of the pacific climate change science program published by the australian government concludes the sea-level rise near tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5mm 02in per year tuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels these include sea water bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools at high tide and the flooding of low-lying areas including the airport during spring tides and king tides the atolls have shown resilience to gradual sea-level rise with atolls and reef islands being able to grow under current climate conditions by generating sufficient sand and coral debris that accumulates and gets dumped on the islands during cyclones gradual sea-level rise also allows for coral polyp activity to increase the reefs however if the increase in sea level occurs at faster rate as compared to coral growth or if polyp activity is damaged by ocean acidification then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain the 2011 report of pacific climate change science program of australia concludes in relation to tuvalu that over the course of the 21st century surface air temperatures and seasurface temperatures are projected to continually increase very high confidence annual and seasonal mean rainfalls are projected to increase high confidence the intensity and frequency of extreme heat days are projected to increase very high confidence the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall days are projected to increase high confidence the incidence of drought is projected to decrease moderate confidence tropical cyclone numbers are projected to decline in the south-east pacific ocean basin 040s 170e130w moderate confidence ocean acidification is projected to continue very high confidence mean sea-level rise is projected to continue very high confidence the south pacific applied geoscience commission sopac suggests that while tuvalu is vulnerable to climate change environmental problems such as population growth and poor coastal management also affect sustainable development sopac ranks the country as extremely vulnerable using the environmental vulnerability index while some commentators have called for the relocation of tuvalus population to australia new zealand or kioa in fiji in 2006 maatia toafa prime minister from 2004 to 2006 said his government did not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population would need to be evacuated in 2013 prime minister enele sopoaga said that relocating tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself for tuvalu i think we really need to mobilise public opinion in the pacific as well as in the rest of world to really talk to their lawmakers to please have some sort of moral obligation and things like that to do the right thing 2015 united nations climate change conference cop21 prime minister enele sopoaga said at the 2015 united nations climate change conference cop21 that the goal for cop21 should be a global temperature goal of below 15 degrees celsius relative to pre-industrial levels which is the position of the alliance of small island states prime minister sopoaga said in his speech to the meeting of heads of state and government tuvalus future at current warming is already bleak any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of tuvalu for small island developing states least developed countries and many others setting a global temperature goal of below 15 degrees celsius relative to pre-industrial levels is critical i call on the people of europe to think carefully about their obsession with 2 degrees surely we must aim for the best future we can deliver and not a weak compromise his speech concluded with the plea lets do it for tuvalu for if we save tuvalu we save the world the countries participating in the paris agreement agreed to reduce their carbon output as soon as possible and to do their best to keep global warming to well below 2c enele sopoaga described the important outcomes of cop21 as including the stand-alone provision for assistance to small island states and some of the least developed countries for loss and damage resulting from climate change and the ambition of limiting temperature rise to 15 degrees by the end of the century filmography and bibliography see also tuvalu portal outline of tuvalu te kakeega iii national strategy for sustainable development-2016-2020 tuvalu from ucb
