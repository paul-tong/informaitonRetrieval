urban centres include nakuru and eldoret nilotic-speaking pastoralists ancestral to kenyas nilotic speakers started migrating from present-day southern sudan into kenya around 500 bc european colonisation of kenya began in the 19th century during the european exploration of the interior the modern-day kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the british empire in 1895 and the subsequent kenya colony which began in 1920 numerous disputes between great britain and the colony led to the mau mau revolution which began in 1952 and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963 after independence kenya remained a member of the commonwealth of nations the current constitution was adopted in 2010 to replace the 1963 independence constitution kenya is a presidential

a major regional commercial hub agriculture is the largest sector tea and coffee are traditional cash crops while fresh flowers are a fast-growing export the service industry is also a major economic driver particularly tourism kenya is a member of the east african community trade bloc though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the greater horn of africa africa is kenyas largest export market followed by the european union etymology the republic of kenya is named after mount kenya the earliest recorded version of the modern name was written by german explorer johann ludwig krapf in the 19th century while travelling with a kamba caravan led by the legendary long distance trader chief kivoi krapf spotted the mountain peak and asked what it was called kivoi told him k-nyaa or kma- knyaa probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded them of the feathers of the cock ostrich the agikuyu who inhabit the slopes of mt kenya call it krma krnyaga in kikuyu while the embu call it kirenyaa all three names have the same meaning ludwig krapf recorded the name as both kenia and kegnia others say that this wason the contrarya very precise notation of a correct african pronunciation knj an 1882 map drawn by joseph thompsons a scottish geologist and naturalist indicated mt kenya as mt kenia 1862 the mountains name was accepted pars pro toto as the name of the country it did not come into widespread official use during the early colonial period when the country was instead referred to as the east african protectorate it was changed to the colony of kenya in 1920 history prehistory fossils found in kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago recent findings near lake turkana indicate that hominids such as homo habilis 18 and 25 million years ago and homo erectus 19 million to 350000 years ago are possible direct ancestors of modern homo sapiens and lived in kenya in the pleistocene epoch during excavations at lake turkana in 1984 paleoanthropologist richard leakey assisted by kamoya kimeu discovered the turkana boy a 16-million-year-old fossil belonging to homo erectus previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with mary leakey and louis leakey who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at olorgesailie and hyrax hill later work at the former site was undertaken by glynn isaac neolithic the first inhabitants of present-day kenya were hunter-gatherer groups akin to the modern khoisan speakers these people were later replaced by agropastoralist cushitic speakers from the horn of africa during the early holocene the regional climate shifted from dry to wetter climatic conditions providing an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions such as agriculture and herding in a more favourable environment around 500 bc nilotic-speaking pastoralists ancestral to kenyas nilotic speakers started migrating from present-day southern sudan into kenya nilotic groups in kenya include the samburu luo turkana maasai by the first millennium ad bantu-speaking farmers had moved into the region the bantus originated in west africa along the benue river in what is now eastern nigeria and western cameroon the bantu migration brought new developments in agriculture and iron working to the region bantu groups in kenya include the kikuyu luhya kamba kisii meru kuria aembu ambeere wadawida-watuweta wapokomo and mijikenda among others remarkable prehistoric sites in the interior of kenya include the archaeoastronomical site namoratunga on the west side of lake turkana and the walled settlement of thimlich ohinga in migori county swahili culture and trade 1st century19th century the kenyan coast had served host to communities of ironworkers and communities of bantu subsistence farmers hunters and fishers who supported the economy with agriculture fishing metal production and trade with foreign countries these communities formed the earliest city states in the region which were collectively known as azania by the 1st century ce many of the city-states such as mombasa malindi and zanzibar began to establish trade relations with arabs this led to the increase economic growth of the swahili states introduction of islam arabic influences on the swahili bantu language cultural diffusion as well as the swahili city-states becoming a member of a larger trade network many historians had long believed that the city states were established by arab or persian traders but archeological evidence has led scholars to recognize the city states as an indigenous development which though subjected to foreign influence due to trade retained a bantu cultural core the kilwa sultanate was a medieval sultanate centred at kilwa in modern-day tanzania at its height its authority stretched over the entire length of the swahili coast including kenya it was said to be founded in the 10th century by ali ibn al-hassan shirazi a persian sultan from shiraz in southern iran however scholars have suggested that claims of arab or persian origin of city-states were attempts by the swahili to legitimize themselves both locally and internationally since the 10 century rulers of kilwa would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduce copper coinage the swahili built mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states as well as commercial centres in persia arabia and even india by the 15th-century portuguese voyager duarte barbosa claimed that mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships both of which are bound from sofala and others which come from cambay and melinde and others which sail to the island of zanzibar later on in the 17th century once the swahili coast was conquered and came under direct rule of omani arabs the slave trade was expanded by the omani arabs to meet the demands of plantations in oman and zanzibar initially these traders came mainly from oman but later many came from zanzibar such as tippu tip in addition the portuguese started buying slaves from the omani and zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the transatlantic slave trade by british abolitionists swahili a bantu language with arabic persian and other middle eastern and south asian loanwords later developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples swahili now also has loan words from english throughout the centuries the kenyan coast has played host to many merchants and explorers among the cities that line the kenyan coast is the city of malindi it has remained an important swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled mombasa for dominance in the african great lakes region malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers in 1414 the chinese trader and explorer zheng he representing the ming dynasty visited the east african coast on one of his last treasure voyages malindi authorities welcomed the portuguese explorer vasco da gama in 1498 british kenya 18881962 the colonial history of kenya dates from the establishment of a german protectorate over the sultan of zanzibars coastal possessions in 1885 followed by the arrival of the imperial british east africa company in 1888 imperial rivalry was prevented when germany handed its coastal holdings to britain in 1890 this was followed by the building of the kenyauganda railway passing through the country the building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groupsnotably the nandi led by orkoiyot koitalel arap samoei for ten years from 1890 to 1900however the british eventually built the railway the nandi were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway during the railway construction era there was a significant inflow of indian people who provided the bulk of the skilled manpower required for construction they and most of their descendants later remained in kenya and formed the core of several distinct indian communities such as the ismaili muslim and sikh communities while building the railway through tsavo a number of the indian railway workers and local african labourers were attacked by two lions known as the tsavo maneaters at the outbreak of world war i in august 1914 the governors of british east africa as the protectorate was generally known and german east africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities lt col paul von lettow-vorbeck took command of the german military forces determined to tie down as many british resources as possible completely cut off from germany von lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign living off the land capturing british supplies and remaining undefeated he eventually surrendered in northern rhodesia today zambia fourteen days after the armistice was signed in 1918 to chase von lettow the british deployed the british indian army troops from india but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot the carrier corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400000 africans contributing to their long-term politicisation in 1920 the east africa protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed kenya for its highest mountain during the early part of the 20th century the interior central highlands were settled by british and other european farmers who became wealthy farming coffee and tea one depiction of this period of change from one colonists perspective is found in the memoir out of africa by danish author baroness karen von blixen-finecke published in 1937 by the 1930s approximately 30000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy the central highlands were already home to over a million members of the kikuyu people most of whom had no land claims in european terms and lived as itinerant farmers to protect their interests the settlers banned the growing of coffee introduced a hut tax and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour a massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled there were 80000 white settlers living in kenya in the 1950s throughout world war ii kenya was an important source of manpower and agriculture for the united kingdom kenya itself was the site of fighting between allied forces and italian troops in 194041 when italian forces invaded wajir and malindi were bombed as well in 1952 princess elizabeth and her husband prince philip were on holiday at the treetops hotel in kenya when her father king george vi died in his sleep the young princess cut short her trip and returned home immediately to take her throne she was crowned queen elizabeth ii at westminster abbey in 1953 and as british hunter and conservationist jim corbett who accompanied the royal couple put it she went up a tree in africa a princess and came down a queen mau mau uprising from october 1952 to december 1959 kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the mau mau rebellion against british rule the mau mau also known as the kenya land and freedom army were primarily members of the kikuyu group the governor requested and obtained british and african troops including the kings african rifles the british began counter-insurgency operations in may 1953 general sir george erskine took charge as commander-in-chief of the colonys armed forces with the personal backing of winston churchill the capture of warhi itote also known as general china on 15 january 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the mau mau command structure operation anvil opened on 24 april 1954 after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the war council the operation effectively placed nairobi under military siege nairobis occupants were screened and the mau mau supporters moved to detention camps the home guard formed the core of the governments strategy as it was composed of loyalist africans not foreign forces such as the british army and kings african rifles by the end of the emergency the home guard had killed 4686 mau mau amounting to 42 of the total insurgents the capture of dedan kimathi on 21 october 1956 in nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the mau mau and essentially ended the military offensive during this period substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred the most important of these was the swynnerton plan which was used to both reward loyalists and punish mau mau independence the first direct elections for native kenyans to the legislative council took place in 1957 despite british hopes of handing power to moderate local rivals it was the kenya african national union kanu of jomo kenyatta that formed a government the colony of kenya and the protectorate of kenya each came to an end on 12 december 1963 with independence being conferred on all of kenya the united kingdom ceded sovereignty over the colony of kenya the sultan of zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony of kenya the sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the protectorate of kenya so that all of kenya would be one sovereign independent state in this way kenya became an independent country under the kenya independence act 1963 of the united kingdom exactly 12 months later on 12 december 1964 kenya became a republic under the name republic of kenya concurrently the kenyan army fought the shifta war against ethnic somali rebels inhabiting the northern frontier district who wanted to join their kin in the somali republic to the north a cease fire was eventually reached with the signature of the arusha memorandum in october 1967 but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969 to discourage further invasions kenya signed a defence pact with ethiopia in 1969 which is still in effect the first president of kenya on 12 december 1964 the republic of kenya was proclaimed and jomo kenyatta became kenyas first president under kenyatta corruption became widespread throughout the government civil service and business community kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963their acquisitions in the central rift valley and coast provinces aroused great anger among landless kenyans his family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property the kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business with kenyatta personally owning the leonard beach hotel he ruled until his death in 22 august 1978 moi era moi was kenyas president from 1978 to 2002 at kenyattas death in 1978 daniel arap moi became president daniel arap moi retained the presidency being unopposed in elections held in 1979 1983 snap elections and 1988 all of which were held under the single party constitution the 1983 elections were held a year early and were a direct result of an abortive military coup attempt on 2 august 1982 the abortive coup was masterminded by a low ranked air force serviceman senior private hezekiah ochuka and was staged mainly by enlisted men in the air force the putsch was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by chief of general staff mahamoud mohamed a veteran somali military official they included the general service unit gsua paramilitary wing of the policeand later the regular police on the heels of the garissa massacre of 1980 kenyan troops committed the wagalla massacre in 1984 against thousands of civilians in wajir county an official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011 the election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo queuing system where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot this was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform several contentious clauses including one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years birth of multiparty politics and the demise of moi era kenya became a multiparty state in 1991 after 26 years of being a single party state on 28 october 1992 president moi dissolved parliament five months before the end of his term as a result preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president the elections were scheduled to take place on 7 december 1992 but delays led to its postponement to 29 december the same year apart from kanu the ruling party other parties represented in the elections included ford kenya and ford asili this election was marked by large-scale intimidation of opponents as well as harassment of election officials it resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to sustain power this election was a turning point for kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of mois leadership and the rule of kanu moi retained the presidency and george saitoti became the vice president although it retained power kanu won 100 seats and lost 88 seats to the six opposition parties the elections of 1992 market the beginning of multiparty politics after more than 25 years rule by kanu following the skirmishes in the aftermath of the 1992 multiparty elections 5000 people were killed and a further 75000 others displaced from their homes in the next five years many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections in 1994 jaramogi oginga odinga died and several coalitions joined his ford kenya party to form a new party called united national democratic alliance however this party was plagued with disagreements in 1995 richard leakey formed the safina party but it was denied registration until november 1997 in 1996 kanu revised the constitution to allow moi to remain president for another term subsequently moi stood for re-election and won a 5th term in 1997 his win was strongly critisised by his major opponents kibaki and odinga as being fraudulent following this win moi was constitutionally barred from vying for another presidential term at the end of his term beginning in 1998 moi attempted to influence the countrys succession politics to have uhuru kenyatta elected in the upcoming 2002 elections president kibaki and the road to a new constitution mois plan to be replaced by uhuru kenyatta failed and mwai kibaki running for the opposition coalition national rainbow coalition narc was elected president anderson 2003 reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers and seemed to mark a turning point in kenyas democratic evolution in 2005 kenyans rejected a plan to replace the 1963 independence constitution with a new one as a result the elections of 2007 happened following the old constitution kibaki was re-elected in a highly contested political scene which was marked by political and ethnic violence this resulted from accusations by the main opposition leader raila odinga that the election results were rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president as a result 1500 people were killed and another 600000 were internally displaced making it the worst post-election violence in kenya to stop the death and displacement of people kibaki and raila agreed to work together with the latter taking the position of a prime minister this made raila the second prime minister of kenya in july 2010 kenya partnered with other east african countries to form the new east african common market within the east african community in august 2010 kenyans held a referendum and passed a new constitution which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government devolution of government and separation of powers following the passage of the new constitution kenya became a presidentialrepresentative democratic republic whereby the president of kenya is both head of state and head of government and of a multi-party system the new constitution also states that executive powers is exercised by the executive branch of government headed by the president who chairs the cabinet that is composed of people chosen from outside parliament legislative power is vested exclusively in parliament the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature mwai kibaki became the first president to serve under this new constitution while uhuru kenyatta became the first president elected under this constitution in 2011 kenya began sending troops to somalia to fight the islamic terror group al-shabaab in mid-2011 two consecutive missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst drought in east africa seen in 60 years the northwestern turkana region was especially affected with local schools shut down as a result the crisis was reportedly over by early 2012 because of coordinated relief efforts aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery initiatives including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds in 2013 kenya had its first general elections after the new constitution had been passed uhuru kenyatta won in a disputed election result leading to a petition by the opposition leader raila odinga the supreme court upheld the election results and president kenyatta began his term with william ruto as the deputy president despite the outcome of this ruling the supreme court and the head of the supreme court were seen as a powerful institutions that could carry out its role of checking the powers of the president in 2017 uhuru kenyatta won a second term in office in another disputed election following the defeat raila odinga again petitioned the results in the supreme court accusing the electoral commission of mismanagement of the elections and uhuru kenyatta and his party of rigging the supreme court overturned the election results in what became a landmark ruling in africa and one of the very few in the world in which the results of a presidential elections were annulled this ruling solidified the position of the supreme court as an independent body consequently kenya had a second round of elections for the presidential position in which uhuru emerged the winner after raila refused to participate citing irregularities geography and climate at 580367km 224081sqmi kenya is the worlds forty-seventh largest country after madagascar it lies between latitudes 5n and 5s

bovids participate in a large scale annual migration more than 1 million wildebeest and 200000 zebras participate in the migration across the mara river the big five game animals of africa that is the lion leopard buffalo rhinoceros and elephant can be found in kenya and in the masai mara in particular a significant population of other wild animals reptiles and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country the annual animal migration occurs between june and september with millions of animals taking part attracting valuable foreign tourism two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2900 kilometres 1802mi from the serengeti in neighbouring tanzania to the masai mara in kenya in a constant clockwise fashion searching for food and water supplies this serengeti

both the head of state and head of government and of a multi-party system executive power is exercised by the government legislative power is vested in both the government and the national assembly and the senate the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature there was growing concern especially during former president daniel arap mois tenure that the executive was increasingly meddling with the affairs of the judiciary kenya has a high degree of corruption according to transparency internationals corruption perception index cpi a metric which attempts to gauge the prevalence of public sector corruption in various countries in 2012 the nation placed 139th out of 176 total countries in the cpi with a score of 27100 however there are several rather significant developments with regards to curbing corruption from the kenyan government for instance the establishment of a new and independent ethics and anti-corruption commission eacc following general elections held in 1997 the constitution of kenya review act designed to pave the way for more comprehensive amendments to the kenyan constitution was passed by the national parliament in december 2002 kenyans held democratic and open elections most of which were judged free and fair by international observers the 2002 elections marked an important turning point in kenyas democratic evolution in that power was transferred peacefully from the kenya african national union kanu which had ruled the country since independence to the national rainbow coalition narc a coalition of political parties under the presidency of mwai kibaki the new ruling coalition promised to focus its efforts on generating economic growth combating corruption improving education and rewriting its constitution a few of these promises have been met there is free primary education in 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008 secondary education would be heavily subsidised with the government footing all tuition fees 2013 elections and new government under the new constitution and with president kibaki prohibited by term limits from running for a third term deputy prime minister uhuru kenyatta ran for office he won with 5051 of the vote in march 2013 in december 2014 president uhuru kenyatta signed a security laws amendment bill which supporters of the law suggested was necessary to guard against armed groups opposition politicians human rights groups and nine western countries criticised the security bill arguing that it infringed on democratic freedoms the governments of the united states the united kingdom germany and france also collectively issued a press statement cautioning about the laws potential impact through the jubilee coalition the bill was later passed on 19 december in the national assembly under acrimonious circumstances foreign relations kenya has close ties with its fellow swahili-speaking neighbours in the african great lakes region relations with uganda and tanzania are generally strong as the three nations work toward economic and social integration through common membership in the east african community relations with somalia have historically been tense although there has been some military co-ordination against islamist insurgents kenya has good relations with the united kingdom kenya is one of the most pro-american nations in africa and the wider world with international criminal court trial dates scheduled in 2013 for both president kenyatta and deputy president william ruto related to the 2007 election aftermath us president barack obama chose not to visit the country during his mid-2013 african trip later in the summer kenyatta visited china at the invitation of president xi jinping after a stop in russia and not having visited the united states as president in july 2015 obama visited kenya the first american president to visit the country while in office armed forces the kenya defence forces are the armed

regularly deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world further in the aftermath of the national elections of december 2007 and the violence that subsequently engulfed the country a commission of inquiry the waki commission commended its readiness and adjudged it to have performed its duty well nevertheless there have been serious allegations of human rights violations most recently while conducting counter-insurgency operations in the mt elgon area and also in the district of mandera central kenyas armed forces like many government institutions in the country have been tainted by corruption allegations because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of state security the corruption has been hidden from public view and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety this has changed recently in what are by kenyan standards unprecedented revelations in 2010 credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment and procurement of armoured personnel carriers further the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned administrative divisions kenya is divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties that are headed by governors these 47 counties now form the first-order divisions of kenya the smallest administrative units in kenya are called locations locations often coincide with electoral wards locations are usually named after their central villagestowns many larger towns consist of several locations each location has a chief appointed by the state constituencies are an electoral subdivision with each county comprising a whole number of constituencies an interim boundaries commission was formed in year 2010 to review the constituencies and in its report it recommended creation of an additional 80 constituencies previous to the 2013 elections there were 210 constituencies in kenya human rights homosexual acts are illegal in kenya and punishable by up to 14 years in prison though the state often turns a blind eye on prosecuting homosexuals according to 2013 survey by the pew research center 90 of kenyans believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society while addressing a joint press conference together with president barack obama in 2015 president kenyatta declined to assure kenyas commitment to gay rights saying that the issue of gay rights is really a non-issue but there are some things that we must admit we dont share our culture our societies dont accept in november 2008 wikileaks brought wide international attention to the cry of blood report in the report the kenya national commission on human rights knchr reported these in their key finding e stating that the forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings appeared to be official policy sanctioned by the political leadership the police the police often shoot suspected gangsters in public as a new strategy to fight the rising

inefficient employing 75 of the workforce compared to less than 3 in the food secure developed countries kenya is usually classified as a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market but it is not one of the least developed countries the economy has seen much expansion seen by strong performance in tourism higher education and telecommunications and acceptable post-drought results in agriculture especially the vital tea sector kenyas economy grew by more than 7 in 2007 and its foreign debt was greatly reduced but this changed immediately after the disputed presidential election of december 2007 following the chaos which engulfed the country telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade now comprises 62 of gdp 22 of gdp still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75 of the labour force a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food securityan important catalyst of economic growth a small portion of the population relies on food aid industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector accounting for 16 of gdp the service industry and manufacturing sectors only employ 25 of the labour force but contribute 75 of gdp kenya also exports textiles worth over 400million under agoa privatisation of state corporations like the defunct kenya post and telecommunications company which resulted in east africas most profitable companysafaricom has led to their revival because of massive private investment as of may2011 economic prospects are positive with 45 gdp growth expected largely because of expansions in tourism telecommunications transport construction and a recovery in agriculture the world bank estimated growth of 43 in 2012 in march 1996 the presidents of kenya

contributor to kenyas gross domestic product gdp after the service sector in 2005 agriculture including forestry and fishing accounted for 24 of gdp as well as for 18 of wage employment and 50 of revenue from exports the principal cash crops are tea horticultural produce and coffee horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of kenyas exports the production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations production downturns periodically necessitate food aidfor example in 2004 aid for 18million people because of one of kenyas intermittent droughts a consortium led by the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics icrisat has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties instead of maize in particularly dry areas pigeon peas are very drought resistant so can be grown in areas with less than 650mm annual rainfall successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing this work which included linking producers to wholesalers helped to increase local producer prices by 2025 in nairobi and mombasa the commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty tea coffee sisal pyrethrum corn and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands one of the most successful agricultural production regions in africa livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east coconuts pineapples cashew nuts cotton sugarcane sisal and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas kenya has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty 53 of the population lives below the poverty line a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid poor roads an inadequate railway network under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets this was last seen in august and september 2011 prompting the kenyans for

companies are the main health care providers in the country even for the nations poorest people the private health sector is larger and more easily accessible than both the public and the non-profit health sectors in terms of facilities and personnel according to a world bank report nearly half of the poorest 20 percent of kenyans use a private health facility when a child is sick private health facilities are largely preferred for their strong brands value-addition and focused patient-centered care in contrast to the minimalist evidence-based care provided in public health facilities private health facilities are diverse and cater for all economic groups hospitals such as the aga khan hospital and the mombasa hospital are comparable to many preferred hospitals in the developed world but are expensive and accessible only to the rich and the insured many affordable and low-cost private medical institutions and clinics exist and are easily accessible to ordinary and middle-class residents but are commonly unregistered and unlicensed and run by similarly unregistered and unlicensed personnel posing a grave danger to the public all registered medical facilities are subjected to regular supervisory and supportive visits from a joint multi-cadre team of health officials from the county government and national regulatory bodies in order to meet the legal threshold of the fair administrative action act 2015 and may choose to undergo additional supportive and quality assurance and improvement processes by operating under a social franchise such as the joint government-donor funded tunza family network the control of medical practice by laymen through limited liability companies county governments and other artificial legal entities is widespread and largely tolerated unlike other countries where medical affairs are strictly handled by medically qualified administrators the health sector and health facilities are not protected by any special laws and are prone to mismanagement with health workers frequently being subjected to verbal emotional and physical attacks by patients and administrators alike the public health sector consists of community-based level i services which are run by community health workers dispensaries level ii facilities which are run by nurses health centers level iii facilities which are run by clinical officers sub-county hospitals level iv facilities which may be run by a clinical officer or a medical officer county hospitals level v facilities which may be run by a medical officer or a medical practitioner and national referral hospitals level vi facilities which are run by fully qualified medical practitioners consultants and sub-specialists nurses are by far the largest group of front-line health care providers in all sectors followed by clinical officers medical officers and medical practitioners according to the kenya national bureau of statistics in 2011 there were 65000 qualified nurses registered in the country 8600 clinical officers and 7000 doctors for the population of 43 million people these figures from official registers include those who have died or left the profession hence the actual number

and urban dwellers despite major achievements in the health sector kenya still faces many challenges the life expectancy estimate has dropped to approximately 55 years in 2009five years below 1990

of poverty directly correlate with a countrys economic performance and wealth distribution half of kenyans live below the poverty level preventable diseases like malaria hivaids pneumonia diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden major child-killers and responsible for much morbidity weak policies corruption inadequate health workers weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame according to 2009 estimates hiv prevalence is about 63 of the adult population however the 2011 unaids report suggests that the hiv epidemic may be improving in kenya as hiv prevalence is declining among young people ages 1524 and pregnant women kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006 women the total fertility rate in kenya is estimated to be 449 children per woman in 2012 according to a 200809 survey by the kenyan government the total fertility rate was 46 and the contraception usage rate among married women was 46 maternal mortality is high partly because of female genital mutilation with about 27 of women having undergone it this practice is however on the decline as the country becomes more modernised and the practice was also banned in the country in 2011 women were economically empowered before colonialization by colonial land alienation women lost access and control of land they became more economically dependent on men
