military campaigns against them the ultimate han victory in these wars eventually forced the xiongnu to accept vassal status as han tributaries these campaigns expanded han sovereignty into the tarim basin of central asia divided the xiongnu into two separate confederations and helped establish the vast trade network known as the silk road which reached as far as the mediterranean world the territories north of hans borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic xianbei confederation emperor wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south annexing nanyue in 111 bc and dian in

family members since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned after several insurrections by han kingsthe largest being the rebellion of the seven states in 154 bcthe imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 bc limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff this duty was assumed by the imperial court kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes the kingdoms were

troubled about the abundant han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the xiongnu along the northern borders and he established a trade embargo against the group in retaliation the xiongnu invaded what is now shanxi province where they defeated the han forces at baideng in 200 bc after negotiations the heqin agreement in 198 bc nominally held the leaders of the xiongnu and the han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance but the han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes food and wine to the xiongnu despite the tribute and a negotiation between laoshang chanyu r174160 bc and emperor wen r180157 bc to reopen border markets many of the chanyus xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided han territories south of the great wall for additional goods in a court conference assembled by emperor wu r14187 bc in 135 bc the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement emperor wu accepted this despite continuing xiongnu raids however a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at mayi involving the assassination of the chanyu would throw the xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the han when this plot failed in 133 bc emperor wu launched a series of massive military invasions into xiongnu territory the assault culminated in 119 bc at the battle of mobei where the han commanders huo qubing d117 bc and wei qing d106 bc forced the xiongnu court to flee north of the gobi desert after wus reign han forces continued to prevail against the xiongnu the

northwestern territory in 111 bc in that year the han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region jiuquan zhangyi dunhuang and wuwei the majority of people on the frontier were soldiers on occasion the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor the court also encouraged commoners such as farmers merchants landowners and hired laborers to voluntarily migrate to the frontier even before hans expansion into central asia diplomat zhang qians travels from 139 to 125 bc had established chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations zhang encountered dayuan fergana kangju sogdiana and daxia bactria formerly the greco-bactrian kingdom he also gathered information on shendu indus river valley of north india and anxi the parthian empire all of these countries eventually received han embassies these connections marked the beginning of the silk road trade network that extended to the roman empire bringing han items like silk to rome and roman goods such as glasswares to china from roughly 115 to 60 bc han forces fought the xiongnu over control of the oasis city-states in the tarim basin han was eventually victorious and established the protectorate of the western regions in 60 bc which dealt with the regions defense and foreign affairs the han also expanded southward the naval conquest of nanyue in 111 bc expanded the han realm into what are now modern guangdong guangxi and northern vietnam yunnan was brought into the han realm with the conquest

bronze-coin currency the liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 bc and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early eastern han the issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the han dynasty the government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the reformists gained greater influence in the court the reformists opposed the modernist faction that had dominated court politics in emperor wus reign and during the subsequent regency of huo guang d68 bc the modernists argued for an aggressive and

the emperor was often a minor ruled over by a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same liu family clan the rest of society including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks ershi gongcheng each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges the highest rank of full marquess came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom holders of the rank immediately below that of ordinary marquess received a pension but had no territorial rule officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige the highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses by the eastern han period local elites of unattached scholars teachers students and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship when the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late eastern han many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office the farmer or specifically the small landowner-cultivator was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status such as tenants wage laborers and in rare cases slaves artisans technicians tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants state-registered merchants who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status these were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials wealthy landowners such as nobles and officials often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle unlike slaves retainers could come and go from their masters home as they pleased medical physicians pig breeders and butchers had a fairly high social status while occultist diviners runners and messengers had low status marriage gender and kinship the han-era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house unlike families of later dynasties according to confucian family norms various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy for example there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle marriages were highly ritualized particularly for the wealthy and included many important steps the giving of betrothal gifts known as bridewealth and dowry were especially important a lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife but as a concubine arranged marriages were normal with the fathers input on his offsprings spouse being considered more important than the mothers monogamous marriages were also normal although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers under certain conditions dictated by custom not law both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry however a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husbands family after his death in order to remarry the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee her children would not be allowed to go with her apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture each son received an equal share of the family property unlike the practice in later dynasties the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries though this was usually much less than the shares of sons a different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will but it is unclear how common this was women were expected to obey the will of their father then their husband and then their adult son in old age however it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule especially in regard to mothers over their sons and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers women were exempt from the annual corve labor duties but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning the most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women other women helped on their brothers farms or became singers dancers sorceresses respected medical physicians and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes some women formed spinning collectives aggregating the resources of several different families education literature and philosophy the early western han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of legalism huang-lao daoism and confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy however the han court under emperor wu gave confucianism exclusive patronage he abolished all academic chairs or erudites bsh not dealing with the confucian five classics in 136 bc and encouraged nominees for office to receive a confucian-based education at the imperial university that he established in 124 bc unlike the original ideology espoused by confucius or kongzi 551479 bc han confucianism in emperor wus reign was the creation of dong zhongshu 179104 bc dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical confucian ideas of ritual filial piety and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies much to the interest of the ruler dongs synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe the imperial university grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30000 by the 2nd century ad a confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments some important texts were created and studied by scholars philosophical works written by yang xiong 53 bc18 ad huan tan 43 bc28 ad wang chong 27100 ad and wang fu 78163 ad questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to

book of han written by ban biao 354 ad his son ban gu 3292 ad and his daughter ban zhao 45116 ad there were dictionaries such as the shuowen jiezi by xu shen c 58c 147 ad and the fangyan by yang xiong biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of emperor wu law and order han scholars such as jia yi 201169 bc portrayed the previous qin dynasty as a brutal regime however archaeological evidence from zhangjiashan and shuihudi reveal that many of the statutes in the han law code compiled by chancellor xiao he d193 bc were derived from qin law various cases for rape physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court women although usually having fewer rights by custom were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men while suspects were jailed convicted criminals were never imprisoned instead punishments were commonly monetary fines periods of forced hard labor for convicts and the penalty of death by beheading early han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from qin law a series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the county magistrate and administrators of commanderies complex high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the minister of justice in the capital or even the emperor in each han county was several districts each overseen by a chief of police order in the cities was maintained

were also eaten included chickens mandarin ducks geese cows sheep pigs camels and dogs various types were bred specifically for food while most were used as pets turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes commonly hunted game such as owl pheasant magpie sika deer and chinese bamboo partridge were consumed seasonings included sugar honey salt and soy sauce beer and wine were regularly consumed clothing the types of clothing worn and the materials used during the han period depended upon social class wealthy folk could afford silk robes skirts socks and mittens coats made of badger or fox fur duck plumes and slippers with inlaid leather pearls and silk lining peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp wool and ferret skins religion cosmology and metaphysics families throughout han china made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities spirits and ancestors at temples and shrines they believed that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm it was thought that each person had a two-part soul the spirit-soul hun which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals xian and the body-soul po which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony in addition to his many other roles the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to heaven the main deities known as the five powers and the spirits shen of mountains and rivers it was believed that the three realms of heaven earth and mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases if the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual ethics and morals he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes floods droughts epidemics and swarms of locusts it was believed that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the queen mother of the west or mount penglai han-era daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs by the 2nd century ad daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the way of the five pecks of rice its followers believed that the sage-philosopher laozi fl6th century bc was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout

earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher theoretically there were no limits to his power however state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference tingyi where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issuepressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions if the emperor rejected a court conference decision he risked alienating his high ministers nevertheless emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences below the emperor were his cabinet members known as the three councillors of state san gong these were the chancellor or minister over the masses chengxiang or da situ the imperial counselor or excellency of works yushi dafu or da sikong and grand commandant or grand marshal taiwei or da sima the chancellor whose title was changed to minister over the masses in 8 bc was chiefly responsible for drafting the government budget the chancellors other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population leading court conferences acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office he could appoint officials below the salary-rank of 600 bushels the imperial counselors chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials he shared similar duties with the chancellor such as receiving annual provincial reports however when his title was changed to minister of works in 8 bc his chief duty became oversight of public works projects the grand commandant whose title was changed to grand marshal in 119 bc before reverting to grand commandant in 51 ad was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then regent during the western han period in the eastern han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two councillors of state ranked below the three councillors of state were the nine ministers jiu qing who each headed a specialized ministry the minister of ceremonies taichang was the chief official in charge of religious rites rituals prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars the minister of the household guang lu xun was in charge of the emperors security within the palace grounds external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot the minister of the guards weiwei was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls towers and gates of the imperial palaces the minister coachman taipu was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables horses carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces the minister of justice tingwei was the chief official in charge of upholding administering and interpreting the law the minister herald da honglu was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court such as nobles and foreign ambassadors the minister of the imperial clan zongzheng oversaw the imperial courts interactions with the empires nobility and extended imperial family such as granting fiefs and titles the minister of finance da sinong was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement the minister steward shaofu served the emperor exclusively providing him with entertainment and amusements proper food and clothing medicine and physical care valuables and equipment local government in the han dynasty excluding kingdoms and marquessates was divided in descending order of size into political units of provinces zhou commanderies jun and counties xian a county was divided into several districts the latter composed of a group of hamlets each containing about a hundred families the heads of provinces whose official title was changed from inspector to governor and vice versa several times during han were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations on the basis of their reports the officials in these local administrations would be promoted demoted dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court a governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court the lower-ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion a commandery consisted of a group of counties and was headed by an administrator he was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense lawsuits seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by emperor wu the head of a large county of about 10000 households was called a prefect while the heads of smaller counties were called chiefs and both could be referred to as magistrates a magistrate maintained law and order in his county registered the populace for taxation mobilized commoners for annual corve duties repaired schools and supervised public works kingdoms and marquessates kingdomsroughly the size of commanderieswere ruled exclusively by the emperors male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms before 157 bc some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives granted to them in return for their services to emperor gaozu the administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government although the emperor appointed the chancellor of each kingdom kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs however in 145 bc after several insurrections by the kings emperor jing removed the kings rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than 400 bushels the imperial counselors and nine ministers excluding the minister coachman of every kingdom were abolished although the chancellor was still appointed by the central government with these reforms kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom similarly the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquesss fief were appointed by the central government a marquesss chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county prefect like a king the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income military at the beginning of the han dynasty every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military the minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after emperor zhaos r8774 bc reign conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers the year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces infantry cavalry or navy the year of active service was served either on the frontier in a kings court or under the minister of the guards in the capital a small professional paid standing army was stationed near the capital during the eastern han conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax the eastern han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army the volunteer army comprised the southern army nanjun while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the northern army beijun led by colonels xiaowei the northern army consisted of five regiments each composed of several thousand soldiers when central authority collapsed after 189 ad wealthy landowners members of the aristocracynobility and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops buqu during times of war the volunteer army was increased and a much larger militia was raised across the country to supplement the northern army in these circumstances a general jiangjun led a division which was divided into regiments led by colonels and sometimes majors sima regiments were divided into companies and led by captains platoons were the smallest units of soldiers economy variations in currency the han dynasty inherited the ban liang coin type from the qin in the beginning of the han emperor gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins this decision was reversed in 186 bc by his widow grand empress dowager l zhi d 180 bc who abolished private minting in 182 bc l zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins this caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 bc when emperor wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 26g 009oz in weight in 144 bc emperor jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting he also introduced a new coin emperor wu introduced another in 120 bc but a year later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely in favor of the wuzhu coin weighing 32g 011oz the wuzhu became chinas standard coin until the tang dynasty 618907 ad its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during wang mangs regime until it was reinstated in 40 ad by emperor guangwu since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 bc this central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the superintendent of waterways and parks this duty being transferred to the minister of finance during eastern han taxation and property aside from the landowners land tax paid in a portion of their crop yield the poll tax and property taxes were paid in coin cash the annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins the poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28000000000 coins from 118 bc to 5 ad an average of 220000000 coins a year the widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes emperor wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land the small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the han tax base this revenue was threatened during the latter half of eastern han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords the han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms these reforms included reducing taxes temporary remissions of taxes granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts in 168 bc the land tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming households crop yield to one-thirtieth and later to a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty the consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes the labor tax took the form of conscripted labor for one month per year which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six this could be avoided in eastern han with a commutable tax since hired labor became more popular private manufacture and government monopolies in the early western han a wealthy salt or iron industrialist whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand this kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue to eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs emperor wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 bc and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies by eastern han times the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations as well as private businessmen liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 bc however this was repealed in 81 bc and a property tax rate of two coins for every 02l 005 gallons was levied for those who traded it privately by 110 bc emperor wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants apart from emperor mings creation of a short-lived office for price adjustment and stabilization which was abolished in 68 ad central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the eastern han science and technology the han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern chinese science and technology comparable to the level of scientific and technological growth during the song dynasty 9601279 writing materials in the 1st millennium bc typical ancient chinese writing materials were bronzewares animal bones and bamboo slips or wooden boards by the beginning of the han dynasty the chief writing materials were clay tablets silk cloth hemps paper and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps the oldest known chinese piece of hard hempen wrapping paper dates to the 2nd century bc the standard papermaking process was invented by cai lun ad 50121 in 105 the oldest known surviving piece of paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a han watchtower that had been abandoned in ad 110 in inner mongolia metallurgy and agriculture evidence suggests that blast furnaces that convert raw iron ore into pig iron which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast were operational in china by the late spring and autumn period 722481 bc the bloomery was nonexistent in ancient china however the han-era chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process the han dynasty chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons culinary tools carpenters tools and domestic wares a significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools the three-legged iron seed drill invented by the 2nd century bc enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand the heavy moldboard iron plow also invented during the han dynasty required only one man to control it two oxen to pull it it had three plowshares a seed box for the drills a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45730 m 113 acres of land in a single day to protect crops from wind and drought the grain intendant zhao guo created the alternating fields system daitianfa during emperor wus reign this system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons once experiments with this system yielded successful results the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it han farmers also used the pit field system aotian for growing crops which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain in southern and small parts of central han-era china paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice while farmers along the huai river used transplantation methods of rice production structural and geotechnical engineering timber was the chief building material during the han dynasty it was used to build palace halls multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses because wood decays rapidly the only remaining evidence of han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles the oldest surviving wooden halls in china date to the tang dynasty ad 618907 architectural historian robert l thorp points out the scarcity of han-era archaeological remains and claims that often unreliable han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost han architecture though han wooden structures decayed some han-dynasty ruins made of brick stone and rammed earth remain intact this includes stone pillar-gates brick tomb chambers rammed-earth city walls rammed-earth and brick beacon towers rammed-earth sections of the great wall rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood and two rammed-earth castles in gansu the ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals changan and luoyang still stand along with their drainage systems of brick arches ditches and ceramic water pipes monumental stone pillar-gates twenty-nine of which survive from the han period formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites these pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles eaves and balustrades the courtyard house is the most common type of home portrayed in han artwork ceramic architectural models of buildings like houses and towers were found in han tombs perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife these provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture the artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to han roof tiles found at archaeological sites over ten han-era underground tombs have been found many of them featuring archways vaulted chambers and domed roofs underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits the use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground han structures is unknown from han literary sources it is known that wooden-trestle beam bridges arch bridges simple suspension bridges and floating pontoon bridges existed in han china however there are only two known references to arch bridges in han literature and only a single han relief sculpture in sichuan depicts an arch bridge underground mine shafts some reaching depths over 100 metres 330ft were created for the extraction of metal ores borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt the distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes mechanical and hydraulic engineering han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them professional artisan-engineers jiang did not leave behind detailed records of their work han scholars who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described nevertheless some han literary sources provide crucial information for example in 15 bc the philosopher and writer yang xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing the inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman ding huan are mentioned in the miscellaneous notes on the western capital around ad 180 ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the worlds first known zoetrope lamp modern archaeology has led to the discovery of han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in han literary sources as observed in han miniature tomb models but not in literary sources the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff the odometer cart invented during han measured journey lengths using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled this invention is depicted in han artwork by the 2nd century yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the han dynasty for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements these calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured these tools are not mentioned in any han literary sources the waterwheel appeared in chinese records during the han as mentioned by huan tan about ad 20 they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers and were used in pounding threshing and polishing grain however there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in china until about the 5th century the nanyang commandery administrator and mechanical engineer du shi d38 ad created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches the chain pump was first mentioned in china by the philosopher wang chong in his 1st-century balanced discourse the armillary sphere a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere was invented in han china by the 1st century bc using a water clock waterwheel and a series of gears the court astronomer zhang heng ad 78139 was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere to address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock zhang was the first in china to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel zhang also invented a device he termed an earthquake weathervane houfeng didong yi which the british scientist and historian joseph needham described as the ancestor of all seismographs this device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away it employed an inverted pendulum that when disturbed by ground tremors would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths representing all eight directions into a metal toads mouth the account of this device in the book of the later han describes how on one occasion one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance several days later a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in longxi commandery in modern gansu province the direction the device had indicated which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of zhangs device mathematics three han mathematical treatises still exist these are the book on numbers and computation the arithmetical classic of the gnomon and the circular paths of heaven and the nine chapters on the mathematical art han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right-angle triangles square roots cube roots and matrix methods finding more accurate approximations for pi providing mathematical proof of the pythagorean theorem use of the decimal fraction gaussian elimination to solve linear equations and continued fractions to find the roots of equations one of the hans greatest mathematical advancements was the worlds first use of negative numbers negative numbers first appeared in the nine chapters on the mathematical art as black counting rods where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods negative numbers were also used by the greek mathematician diophantus around ad 275 and in the 7th-century bakhshali manuscript of gandhara south asia but were not widely accepted in europe until the 16th century the han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines in musical tuning jing fang 7837 bc realized that 53 perfect fifths was approximate to 31 octaves while creating a musical scale of 60 tones calculating the difference at 176776 the same value of 53 equal temperament discovered by the german mathematician nicholas mercator 16201687 ie 32 astronomy mathematics were essential in drafting the astronomical calendar a lunisolar calendar that used the sun and moon as time-markers throughout the year use of the ancient sifen calendar which measured the tropical year at 3654 days was replaced in 104 bc with the taichu calendar that measured the tropical year at 3651539 days and the lunar month at 2981 days however emperor zhang later reinstated the sifen calendar han chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky including recording the 12 bc appearance of the comet now known as halleys comet han dynasty astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center they assumed that the sun moon and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped they also thought that the illumination of the moon and planets was caused by sunlight that lunar eclipses occurred when the earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the moon and that a solar eclipse occurred when the moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the earth although others disagreed with his model wang chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds cartography ships and vehicles evidence found in chinese literature and archaeological evidence show that cartography existed in china before the han some of the earliest han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the mawangdui silk texts in a 2nd-century-bc tomb the general ma yuan created the worlds first known raised-relief map from rice in the 1st century this date could be revised if the tomb of emperor qin shi huang is excavated and the account in the records of the grand historian concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true although the use of the graduated scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of pei xiu ad 224271 there is evidence that in the early 2nd century cartographer zhang heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps han dynasty chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras such as the tower ship the junk design was developed and realized during the han era junk ships featured a square-ended bow and stern a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in western vessels moreover han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport allowing them to sail on the high seas although ox-carts and chariots were previously used in china the wheelbarrow was first used in han china in the 1st century bc han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the warring-states-era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horses chest was replaced by the softer breast strap later during the northern wei 386534 the fully developed horse collar was invented medicine han-era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase illness was viewed as a sign that qi or vital energy channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted thus han-era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance for example since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase besides dieting han physicians also prescribed moxibustion acupuncture and calisthenics as methods of maintaining ones health when surgery was performed by the chinese physician hua tuo d ad 208 he used anesthesia to numb his patients pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds whereas the physician zhang zhongjing c ad 150c 219 is known to have written the shanghan lun dissertation on typhoid fever it is thought that both he and hua tuo
