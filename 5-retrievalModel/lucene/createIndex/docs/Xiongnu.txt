the xiongnu jnu chinese wadegiles hsiung-nu were a tribal confederation of nomadic peoples who according to ancient chinese sources inhabited the eastern eurasian steppe from the 3rd century bc to the late 1st century ad chinese sources report that modu chanyu the supreme leader after 209bc founded the xiongnu empire after their previous overlords the yuezhi migrated into central asia during the 2nd century bc the xiongnu became a dominant power on the steppes of north-east central asia centred on an area known later as mongolia the xiongnu were also active in areas now part of siberia inner mongolia gansu and xinjiang their relations with adjacent chinese dynasties to the south east were complex with repeated periods of conflict and intrigue alternating with exchanges of tribute trade and marriage treaties during the sixteen kingdoms era they were known as one of the five barbarians attempts to identify the xiongnu with later groups of the western eurasian steppe remain controversial scythians and sarmatians were concurrently to the west the identity of the ethnic core of xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses because only a few words mainly titles and personal names were preserved in the chinese sources the name xiongnu may be cognate with that of the huns or the huna although this is disputed other linguistic links all of them also controversial proposed by scholars include iranian mongolic turkic uralic yeniseian tibeto-burman or multi-ethnic history early history an early reference to the xiongnu was by the han dynasty historian sima qian who wrote about the xiongnu in the records of the grand historian c100 bc drawing a distinct line between the settled huaxia people chinese to the pastoral nomads xiongnu characterizing it as two polar groups in the sense of a civilization versus an uncivilized society the huayi distinction pre-han sources often classify the xiongnu as a hu people which was a blanket term for nomadic people in general it only became an ethnonym for the xiongnu during the han ancient china often came in contact with the xianyun and the xirong nomadic peoples in later chinese historiography some groups of these peoples were believed to be the possible progenitors of the xiongnu people these nomadic people often had repeated military confrontations with the shang and especially the zhou who often conquered and enslaved the nomads in an expansion drift during the warring states period the armies from the qin zhao and yan states were encroaching and conquering various nomadic territories that were inhabited by the xiongnu and other hu peoples sinologist edwin pulleyblank argued that the xiongnu were part of a xirong group called yiqu who had lived in shaanbei and had been influenced by china for centuries before they were driven out by the qin dynasty qins campaign against the xiongnu expanded qins territory at the expense of the xiongnu in 215 bc qin shi huang sent general meng tian to conquer the xiongnu and drive them from the ordos loop which he did later that year after the catastrophic defeat at the hands of meng tian the xiongnu leader touman was forced to flee far into the mongolian plateau the qin empire became a threat to the xiongnu which ultimately led to the reorganization of the many tribes into a confederacy xiongnu tribes chubei huyan lan tribe luandi qiulin xubu state formation in 209 bc three years before the founding of han china the xiongnu were brought together in a powerful confederation under a new chanyu modu chanyu this new political unity transformed them into a more formidable state by enabling formation of larger armies and the ability to exercise better strategic coordination the xiongnu adopted many of the chinese agriculture techniques such as slave labor for heavy labor wore silk like the chinese and lived in chinese-style homes the reason for creating the confederation remains unclear suggestions include the need for a stronger state to deal with the qin unification of china that resulted in a loss of the ordos region at the hands of meng tian or the political crisis that overtook the xiongnu in 215 bc when qin armies evicted them from their pastures on the yellow river after forging internal unity modu expanded the empire on all sides to the north he conquered a number of nomadic peoples including the dingling of southern siberia he crushed the power of the donghu people of eastern mongolia and manchuria as well as the yuezhi in the hexi corridor of gansu where his son jizhu made a skull cup out of the yuezhi king modu also reoccupied all the lands previously taken by the qin general meng tian under modus leadership the xiongnu threatened the han dynasty almost causing emperor gaozu the first han emperor to lose his throne in 200 bc by the time of modus death in 174 bc the xiongnu had driven the yuezhi from the hexi corridor killing the yuezhi king in the process and asserting their presence in the western regions the xiongnu were recognized as the most prominent of the nomads bordering the chinese han empire and during early relations between the xiongnu and the han the former held the balance of power according to the book of han later quoted in duan chengshis ninth century miscellaneous morsels from youyang also according to the han shu wang wu and others were sent as envoys to pay a visit to the xiongnu according to the customs of the xiongnu if the han envoys did not remove their tallies of authority and if they did not allow their faces to be tattooed they could not gain entrance into the yurts wang wu and his company removed their tallies submitted to tattoo and thus gained entry the shanyu looked upon them very highly xiongnu hierarchy after modu later leaders formed a dualistic system of political organisation with the left and right branches of the xiongnu divided on a regional basis the chanyu or shanyu a ruler equivalent to the emperor of china exercised direct authority over the central territory longcheng near the orkhon inscriptions in modern mongolia became the annual meeting place and served as the xiongnu capital the ruler of the xiongnu was called the chanyu under him were the tuqi kings the tuqi king of the left was normally the heir presumptive next lower in the hierarchy came more officials in pairs of left and right the guli the army commanders the great governors the dunghu and the gudu beneath them came the commanders of detachments of one thousand of one hundred and of ten men this nation of nomads a people on the march was organized like an army yap apparently describing the early period places the chanyus main camp north of shanxi with the tuqi king of the left holding the area north of beijing and the tuqi king of the right holding the ordos loop area as far as gansu grousset probably describing the situation after the xiongnu had been driven north places the chanyu on the upper orkhon river near where genghis khan would later establish his capital of karakorum the tuqi king of the left lived in the east probably on the high kherlen river the tuqi king of the right lived in the west perhaps near present-day uliastai in the khangai mountains the marriage treaty system in the winter of 200 bc following a siege of taiyuan emperor gaozu of han personally led a military campaign against modun at the battle of baideng he was ambushed reputedly by 300000 elite xiongnu cavalry the emperor was cut off from supplies and reinforcements for seven days only narrowly escaping capture the han chinese sent princesses to marry xiongnu leaders in their efforts to stop the border raids along with arranged marriages the han sent gifts to bribe the xiongnu to stop attacking after the defeat at pingcheng the han emperor abandoned a military solution to the xiongnu threat instead in 198bc the courtier liu jingzh was dispatched for negotiations the peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a han princess given in marriage to the chanyu called heqin chinese literally harmonious kinship periodic gifts to the xiongnu of silk distilled beverages and rice equal status between the states and the great wall as mutual border this first treaty set the pattern for relations between the han and the xiongnu for sixty years up to 135bc the treaty was renewed nine times each time with an increase in the gifts in 192bc modun even asked for the hand of emperor gaos widow empress l zhi his son and successor the energetic jiyu known as the laoshang chanyu continued his fathers expansionist policies laoshang succeeded in negotiating with emperor wen terms for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system while the xiongnu benefited handsomely from the chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly humiliating and ineffective laoshang showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously on one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near changan in 166 bc he personally led 140000 cavalry to invade anding reaching as far as the imperial retreat at yong in 158 bc his successor sent 30000 cavalry to attack shangdang and another 30000 to yunzhong the xiongnu also practiced marriage alliances with han dynasty officers and officials who defected to their side the older sister of the chanyu the xiongnu ruler was married to the xiongnu general zhao xin the marquis of xi who was serving the han dynasty the daughter of the chanyu was married to the han chinese general li ling after he surrendered and defected the yenisei kirghiz khagans claimed descent from li ling another han chinese general who defected to the xiongnu was li guangli who also married a daughter of the chanyu when the eastern jin dynasty ended the xianbei northern wei received the han chinese jin prince sima chuzhi as a refugee a northern wei xianbei princess married sima chuzhi giving birth to sima jinlong northern liang xiongnu king juqu mujians daughter married sima jinlong war with han dynasty the han dynasty made preparations for war when the han emperor wu dispatched the explorer zhang qian to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the yuezhi people in order to combat the xiongnu during this time zhang married a xiongnu wife who bore him a son and gained the trust of the xiongnu leader while zhang qian did not succeed in this mission his reports of the west provided even greater incentive to counter the xiongnu hold on westward routes out of china and the chinese prepared to mount a large scale attack using the northern silk road to move men and material while han china was making preparations for a military confrontation from the reign of emperor wen the break did not come until 133 bc following an abortive trap to ambush the chanyu at mayi by that point the empire was consolidated politically militarily and economically and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court in that year emperor wu reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty full-scale war broke out in autumn 129 bc when 40000 chinese cavalry made a surprise attack on the xiongnu at the border markets in 127 bc the han general wei qing retook the ordos in 121 bc the xiongnu suffered another setback when huo qubing led a force of light cavalry westward out of longxi and within six days fought his way through five xiongnu kingdoms the xiongnu hunye king was forced to surrender with 40000 men in 119 bc both huo and wei each leading 50000 cavalrymen and 100000 footsoldiers in order to keep up with the mobility of the xiongnu many of the non-cavalry han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot and advancing along different routes forced the chanyu and his court to flee north of the gobi desert major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns according to the analysis of yan you the difficulties were twofold firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances secondly the weather in the northern xiongnu lands was difficult for han soldiers who could never carry enough fuel according to official reports the xiongnu lost 80000 to 90000 men and out of the 140000 horses the han forces had brought into the desert fewer than 30000 returned to china as a result of these battles the chinese controlled the strategic region from the ordos and gansu corridor to lop nor they succeeded in separating the xiongnu from the qiang peoples to the south and also gained direct access to the western regions because of strong chinese control over the xiongnu the xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the han chinese ban chao protector general duhu of the han dynasty embarked with an army of 70000 men in a campaign against the xiongnu insurgents who were harassing the trade route now known as the silk road his successful military campaign saw the subjugation of one xiongnu tribe after another ban chao also sent an envoy named gan ying to daqin rome ban chao was created the marquess of dingyuan ie the marquess who stabilized faraway places for his services to the han empire and returned to the capital luoyang at the age of 70 years and died there in the year 102 following his death the power of the xiongnu in the western regions increased again and the emperors of subsequent dynasties were never again able to reach so far to the west xiongnu civil war 6053 bc when a chanyu died power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age this system which can be compared to gaelic tanistry normally kept an adult male on the throne but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne when the 12th chanyu died in 60 bc power was taken by woyanqudi a grandson of the 12th chanyus cousin being something of a usurper he tried to put his own men in power which only increased the number of his enemies the 12th chanyus son fled east and in 58 bc revolted few would support woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide leaving the rebel son huhanye as the 14th chanyu the woyanqudi faction then set up his brother tuqi as chanyu 58 bc in 57 bc three more men declared themselves chanyu two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by tuqi in that year and surrendered to huhanye the following year in 56 bc tuqi was defeated by huhanye and committed suicide but two more claimants appeared runzhen and huhanyes elder brother zhizhi chanyu runzhen was killed by zhizhi in 54 bc leaving only zhizhi and huhanye zhizhi grew in power and in 53 bc huhanye moved south and submitted to the chinese huhanye used chinese support to weaken zhizhi who gradually moved west in 49 bc a brother to tuqi set himself up as chanyu and was killed by zhizhi in 36 bc zhizhi was killed by a chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near lake balkhash tributary relations with the han in 53 bc huhanyezh decided to enter into tributary relations with han china the original terms insisted on by the han court were that first the chanyu or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage secondly the chanyu should send a hostage prince and thirdly the chanyu should present tribute to the han emperor the political status of the xiongnu in the chinese world order was reduced from that of a brotherly state to that of an outer vassal during this period however the xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity the great wall of china continued to serve as the line of demarcation between han and xiongnu huhanye sent his son the wise king of the right shuloujutang to the han court as hostage in 51 bc he personally visited changan to pay homage to the emperor on the lunar new year in the same year another envoy qijushan was received at the sweet spring palace in the north west of modern shanxi on the financial side huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold cash clothes silk horses and grain for his participation huhanye made two further homage trips in 49 bc and 33 bc with each one the imperial gifts were increased on the last trip huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law as a sign of the decline in the political status of the xiongnu emperor yuan refused giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting one of them was wang zhaojun famed in chinese folklore as one of the four beauties when zhizhi learned of his brothers submission he also sent a son to the han court as hostage in 53bc then twice in 51 bc and 50 bc he sent envoys to the han court with tribute but having failed to pay homage personally he was never admitted to the tributary system in 36 bc a junior officer named chen tang with the help of gan yanshou protector-general of the western regions assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the battle of zhizhi and sent his head as a trophy to changan tributary relations were discontinued during the reign of huduershi 18 ad48 corresponding to the political upheavals of the xin dynasty in china the xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions as well as neighbouring peoples such as the wuhuan in 24 ad hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system southern xiongnu and northern xiongnu the xiongnus new power was met with a policy of appeasement by emperor guangwu at the height of his power huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor modu due to growing regionalism among the xiongnu however huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority in contravention of a principle of fraternal succession established by huhanye huduershi designated his son punu as heir-apparent however as the eldest son of the preceding chanyu bi pi the rizhu king of the right had a more legitimate claim consequently bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the chanyus court nevertheless in 46 ad punu ascended the throne in 48 ad a confederation of eight xiongnu tribes in bis power base in the south with a military force totalling 40000 to 50000 men seceded from punus kingdom and acclaimed bi as chanyu this kingdom became known as the southern xiongnu the northern xiongnu the rump kingdom under punu around the orkhon modern north central mongolia became known as the northern xiongnu punu who became known as the northern chanyu began to put military pressure on the southern xiongnu in 49 ad tsi yung a han governor of liaodong allied with the wuhuan and xianbei attacked the northern xiongnu the northern xiongnu suffered two major defeats one at the hands of the xianbei in 85 ad and by the han during the battle of ikh bayan in 89 ad the northern chanyu fled to the north-west with his subjects in about 155 ad the northern xiongnu were decisively crushed and subjugated by the xianbei the southern xiongnu coincidentally the southern xiongnu were plagued by natural disasters and misfortunes in addition to the threat posed by punu consequently in 50 ad the southern xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with han china the system of tribute was considerably tightened by the han to keep the southern xiongnu under control the chanyu was ordered to establish his court in the meiji district of xihe commandery and the southern xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies at the same time large numbers of chinese were also resettled in these commanderies in mixed han-xiongnu settlements economically the southern xiongnu became reliant on trade with the han tensions were evident between han settlers and practitioners of the nomadic way of life thus in 94 anguo chanyu joined forces with newly subjugated xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the han during the late 2nd century ad the southern xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the han court in 188 the chanyu was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the han suppress a rebellion in hebei many of the xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the han court the murdered chanyus son yufuluo entitled chizhisizhu succeeded him but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189 he travelled to luoyang the han capital to seek aid from the han court but at this time the han court was in disorder from the clash between grand general he jin and the eunuchs and the intervention of the warlord dong zhuo the chanyu had no choice but to settle down with his followers in pingyang a city in shanxi in 195 he died and was succeeded as chanyu by his brother huchuquan chanyu in 215216 ad the warlord-statesman cao cao detained huchuquan chanyu in the city of ye and divided his followers in shanxi into five divisions left right south north and centre this was aimed at preventing the exiled xiongnu in shanxi from engaging in rebellion and also allowed cao cao to use the xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry later the xiongnu aristocracy in shanxi changed their surname from luanti to liu for prestige reasons claiming that they were related to the han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy after huchuquan the southern xiongnu were partitioned into five local tribes each local chief was under the surveillance of a chinese resident while the shanyu was in semicaptivity at the imperial court later xiongnu states former zhao state 304329 in 304 liu yuan became chanyu of the five hordes in 308 declared himself emperor and founded the han zhao dynasty in 311 his son and successor liu cong captured luoyang and with it the emperor huai of jin china in 316 the emperor min of jin china was captured in changan both emperors were humiliated as cupbearers in linfen before being executed in 313 and 318 north china came under xiongnu rule while the remnants of the jin dynasty survived in the south at jiankang in 318 after suppressing a coup by a powerful minister in the xiongnu-han court in which the emperor and a large proportion of the aristocracy were massacred the xiongnu prince liu yao moved the xiongnu-han capital from pingyang to changan and renamed the dynasty as zhao liu yuan had declared the empires name han to create a linkage with han dynastyto which he claimed he was a descendant through a princess but liu yao felt that it was time to end the linkage with han and explicitly restore the linkage to the great xiongnu chanyu maodun and therefore decided to change the name of the state however this was not a break from liu yuan as he continued to honor liu yuan and liu cong posthumously it is hence known to historians collectively as han zhao however the eastern part of north china came under the control of a rebel xiongnu-han general of jie ancestry named shi le liu yao and shi le fought a long war until 329 when liu yao was captured in battle and executed changan fell to shi le soon after and the xiongnu dynasty was wiped out north china was ruled by shi les later zhao dynasty for the next 20 years however the liu xiongnu remained active in the north for at least another century tiefu and xia 260431 the northern tiefu branch of the xiongnu gained control of the inner mongolian region in the 10 years between the conquest of the tuoba xianbei state of dai by the former qin empire in 376 and its restoration in 386 as the northern wei after 386 the tiefu were gradually destroyed by or surrendered to the tuoba with the submitting tiefu becoming known as the dugu liu bobo a surviving prince of the tiefu fled to the ordos loop where he founded a state called the xia thus named because of the xiongnus supposed ancestry from the xia dynasty and changed his surname to helian the helian-xia state was conquered by the northern wei in 42831 and the xiongnu thenceforth effectively ceased to play a major role in chinese history assimilating into the xianbei and han ethnicities tongwancheng meaning unite all nations was the capital of the xia sixteen kingdoms whose rulers claimed descent from modu chanyu the ruined city was discovered in 1996 and the state council designated it as a cultural relic under top state protection the repair of the yongan platform where helian bobo emperor of the da xia regime reviewed parading troops has been finished and restoration on the 31-meter-tall turret follows juqu and northern liang 401460 the juqu were a branch of the xiongnu their leader juqu mengxun took over the northern liang by overthrowing the former puppet ruler duan ye by 439 the juqu power was destroyed by the northern wei their remnants were then settled in the city of gaochang before being destroyed by the rouran interpretation barfield attempted to interpret xiongnu history as well as narrate it he made the following points the xiongnu confederation was unusually long-lived for a steppe empire the purpose of raiding china was not simply for goods but to force the chinese to pay regular tribute the power of the xiongnu ruler was based on his control of chinese tribute which he used to reward his supporters the han and xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the xiongnu state depended on chinese tribute a major xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession if a dead rulers son was not old enough to take command power passed to the late rulers brother this worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation the first time this happened in 60 bc the weaker party adopted what barfield calls the inner frontier strategy they moved south and submitted to china and then used chinese resources to defeat the northern xiongnu and re-establish the empire the second time this happened about 47 ad the strategy failed the southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the xiongnu remained divided theories regarding ethnolinguistic identity see genetic history of east asians the sound of the first chinese character has been reconstructed as qo in old chinese the chinese name for the xiongnu was a pejorative term in itself as the characters have the meaning of fierce slave the chinese characters are pronounced as xingn jnu in modern mandarin chinese huns the supposed old chinese sound of the first character has a possible similarity with the name hun in european languages the second character appears to have no parallel in western terminology whether the similarity is evidence of kinship or mere coincidence is hard to tell it could lend credence to the theory that the huns were in fact descendants of the northern xiongnu who migrated westward or that the huns were using a name borrowed from the northern xiongnu or that these xiongnu made up part of the hun confederation the xiongnu-hun hypothesis originated with the 18th-century french historian joseph de guignes who noticed that ancient chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes associated with the xiongnu by names similar to hun albeit with varying chinese characters tienne de la vaissire has shown that in the sogdian script used in the so-called sogdian ancient letters both the xiongnu and huns were referred to as wn xwn indicating that the two were synonymous although the theory that the xiongnu were precursors of the huns known later in europe is now accepted by many scholars it has yet to become a consensus view the identification with the huns may be either incorrect or an oversimplification as would appear to be the case with a proto-mongol people the rouran who have sometimes been linked to the avars of central europe iranian theories harold walter bailey proposed an iranian origin of the xiongnu recognizing all the earliest xiongnu names of the 2nd century bc as being of the iranian type this theory is supported by turkologist henryk jankowski central asian scholar christopher i beckwith notes that the xiongnu name could be a cognate of scythian saka and sogdia corresponding to a name for northern iranians according to beckwith the xiongnu could have contained a leading iranian component when they started out but more likely they had earlier been subjects of an iranian people and learned from them the iranian nomadic model in the unesco-published history of civilizations of central asia its editor jnos harmatta concludes that the royal tribes and kings of the xiongnu bore iranian names that all xiongnu words noted by the chinese can be explained from a scythian language and that it is therefore clear that the majority of hsiung-nu tribes spoke an eastern iranian language mongolic theories mongolian and other scholars have suggested that the xiongnu spoke a language related to the mongolic languages mongolian archaeologists proposed that the slab grave culture people were the ancestors of the xiongnu and some scholars have suggested that the xiongnu may have been the ancestors of the mongols according to the book of song section joujan joujans rouran khaganate alternative name was tatar or tartar and they were a xiongnu tribe nikita bichurin considered xiongnu and xianbei to be two subgroups or dynasties but the same ethnicity genghis khan refers to the time of modu chanyu as the remote times of our chanyu in his letter to daoist qiu chuji sun and moon symbol of xiongnu that discovered by archaeologists is similar to mongolian soyombo symbol turkic theories proponents of a turkic language theory include eh parker jean-pierre abel-rmusat julius klaproth kurakichi shiratori gustaf john ramstedt annemarie von gabain and omeljan pritsak some sources say the ruling class was proto-turkic while others suggest it was proto-hun craig benjamin sees the xiongnu as either proto-turks or proto-mongols who possibly spoke a language related to the dingling both the 7th-century chinese history of the northern dynasties and the book of zhou an inscription in the sogdian language report the turks to be a subgroup of the huns yeniseian theories lajos ligeti was the first to suggest that the xiongnu spoke a yeniseian language in the early 1960s edwin pulleyblank was the first to expand upon this idea with credible evidence in 2000 alexander vovin reanalyzed pulleyblanks argument and found further support for it by utilizing the most recent reconstruction of old chinese phonology by starostin and baxter and a single chinese transcription of a sentence in the language of the jie people a member tribe of the xiongnu confederacy previous turkic interpretations of the aforementioned sentence do not match the chinese translation as precisely as using yeniseian grammar pulleybank and d n keightley asserted that the xiongnu titles were originally siberian words but were later borrowed by the turkic and mongolic peoples the xiongnu language gave to the later turkic and mongolian empires a number of important culture words including turkish tngri mongolian tenggeri was originally the xiongnu word for heaven chengli th-wrj titles such as tarqan and tegin and kaghan were also inherited from the xiongnu language multiple ethnicities since the early 19th century a number of western scholars have proposed a connection between various language families or subfamilies and the language or languages of the xiongnu albert terrien de lacouperie considered them to be multi-component groups many scholars believe the xiongnu confederation was a mixture of different ethno-linguistic groups and that their main language as represented in the chinese sources and its relationships have not yet been satisfactorily determined kim rejects old racial theories or even ethnic affiliations in favour of the historical reality of these extensive multiethnic polyglot steppe empires chinese sources link the tiele people and ashina to the xiongnu not all turkic peoples according to the book of zhou and the history of the northern dynasties the ashina clan was a component of the xiongnu confederation but this connection is disputed and according to the book of sui and the tongdian they were mixed nomads traditional chinese simplified chinese pinyin z h from pingliang the ashina and tiele may have been separate ethnic groups who mixed with the xiongnu indeed chinese sources link many nomadic peoples hu see wu hu on their northern borders to the xiongnu just as greco-roman historiographers called avars and huns scythians the greek cognate of tourkia greek was used by the byzantine emperor and scholar constantine vii porphyrogenitus in his book de administrando imperio though in his use turks always referred to magyars such archaizing was a common literary topos and implied similar geographic origins and nomadic lifestyle but not direct filiation some uyghurs claimed descent from the xiongnu according to chinese history weishu the founder of the uyghur khaganate was descended from a xiongnu ruler but many contemporary scholars do not consider the modern uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old uyghur khaganate because modern uyghur language and old uyghur languages are different rather they consider them to be descendants of a number of people one of them the ancient uyghurs language isolate theories the turkologist gerhard doerfer has denied any possibility of a relationship between the xiongnu language and any other known language and rejected in the strongest terms any connection with turkic or mongolian archaeology and genetics see genetic history of east asians the original geographic location of the xiongnu is disputed among steppe archaeologists since the 1960s the geographic origin of the xiongnu has attempted to be traced through an analysis of early iron age burial constructions no region has been proven to have mortuary practices that clearly match that of the xiongnu archaeology the political center of the xiongnu state was in mongolia and almost all of the xiongnu kings were buried in mongolia in the 1920s pyotr kozlovs excavations of the royal tombs at the noin-ula burial site in northern mongolia that date to around the first century ce provided a glimpse into the lost world of the xiongnu other archaeological sites have been unearthed in inner mongolia and elsewhere they represent the neolithic and historical periods of the xiongnus history those included the ordos culture many of them had been identified as the xiongnu cultures the region was occupied predominantly by peoples showing mongoloid features known from their skeletal remains and artifacts portraits found in the noin-ula excavations demonstrate other cultural evidences and influences showing that chinese and xiongnu art have influenced each other mutually some of these embroidered portraits in the noin-ula kurgans also depict the xiongnu with long braided hair with wide ribbons which is seen to be identical with the ashina clan hair-style well-preserved bodies in xiongnu and pre-xiongnu tombs in the mongolian republic and southern siberia show both mongoloid and caucasian features analysis of skeletal remains from sites attributed to the xiongnu provides an identification of dolichocephalic mongoloid ethnically distinct from neighboring populations in present-day mongolia russian and chinese anthropological and craniofacial studies show that the xiongnu were physically very heterogenous with six different population clusters showing different degrees of mongoloid and caucasoid physical traits these clusters point to significant cross-regional migrations both east to west and west to east that likely started in the neolithic period and continued to the medieval mongolian period presently there exist four fully excavated and well documented cemeteries ivolga dyrestui burkhan tolgoi and daodunzi additionally thousands of tombs have been recorded in transbaikalia and mongolia in addition to these the tamir 1 excavation site from a 2005 silkroad arkanghai excavation project is the only xiongnu cemetery in mongolia to be fully mapped in scale tamir 1 was located on tamiryn ulaan khoshuu a prominent granitic outcrop near other cemeteries of the neolithic bronze age and mongol periods important finds at the site included a lacquer bowl glass beads and three tlv mirrors archaeologists from this project believe that these artifacts paired with the general richness and size of the graves suggests that this cemetery was for more important or wealthy xiongnu individuals the tlv mirrors are of particular interest three mirrors were acquired from three different graves at the site the mirror found at feature 160 is believed to be a low-quality local imitation of a han mirror while the whole mirror found at feature 100 and fragments of a mirror found at feature 109 are believed to belong to the classical tlv mirrors and date back to the xin dynasty or the early to middle eastern han period the archaeologists have chosen to for the most part refrain from positing anything about han-xiongnu relations based on these particular mirrors however they were willing to mention the following there is no clear indication of the ethnicity of this tomb occupant but in a similar brick-chambered tomb of late eastern han period at the same cemetery archaeologists discovered a bronze seal with the official title that the han government bestowed upon the leader of the xiongnu the excavators suggested that these brick chamber tombs all belong to the xiongnu qinghai 1993 classifications of these burial sites make distinction between two prevailing type of burials 1 monumental ramped terrace tombs which are often flanked by smaller satellite burials and 2 circular or ring burials some scholars consider this a division between elite graves and commoner graves other scholars find this division too simplistic and not evocative of a true distinction because it shows ignorance of the nature of the mortuary investments and typically luxuriant burial assemblages and does not account for the discovery of other lesser interments that do not qualify as either of these types genetics a majority 89 of xiongnu mitochondrial sequences from the egyin gol valley can be classified as belonging to asian haplogroups and nearly 11 belong to european mitochondrial haplogroups over the past decade chinese archaeologists have published several reviews regarding the results of excavations in xinjiang they imply the xiongnus supreme ruling class particularly interesting are the tombs in the cemetery at heigouliang xinjiang the black

distinctions within the xiongnu culture more variety is visible from site to site than from era to era in terms of the chinese chronology yet all form a whole that is distinct from that of the han and other peoples of the non-chinese north in some instances iconography can not be used as the main cultural identifier because art depicting animal predation is common among the steppe peoples an example of animal predation associated with xiongnu culture is a tiger carrying dead prey we see a similar image in work from maoqinggou a site which is presumed to have been under xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-xiongnu from maoqinggou we see the prey replaced by an extension of the tigers foot the work also depicts a lower level of execution maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder less detailed style in its broadest sense xiongnu iconography of animal predation include examples such as the gold headdress from aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in xigouban inner mongolia the gold headdress can be viewed along with some other examples of xiongnu art from the external links at the bottom of this article xiongnu art is harder to distinguish from saka or scythian art there was a similarity present in stylistic execution but xiongnu art and saka art did often differ in terms of iconography saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes especially with dead prey or same-animal combat additionally saka art included elements not common to xiongnu iconography such as a winged horned horse the two cultures also used two different bird heads xiongnu depictions of birds have a tendency to have a moderate eye and beak and have ears while saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak and no ears some scholars claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences scholar sophia-karin psarras claims that xiongnu images of animal predation specifically tiger plus prey is spiritual representative of death and rebirth and same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition of or maintenance of power rock art and writing the rock art of the yin and helan mountains is dated from the 9th millennium bc to the 19th century ad it consists mainly of engraved signs petroglyphs and only minimally of painted images excavations conducted between 1924 and 1925 in the noin-ula kurgans produced objects with over twenty carved characters which were either identical or very similar to that of to the runic letters of the old turkic alphabet discovered in the orkhon valley from this a some scholars hold that the xiongnu had a script similar to eurasian runiform and this alphabet itself served as the basis for the ancient turkic writing the records of the grand historian vol 110 state that when the xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message they made cuts on a piece of wood they also mention a hu script 2nd century bce 2nd century ce characters of hun-xianbei script mongolia and inner
