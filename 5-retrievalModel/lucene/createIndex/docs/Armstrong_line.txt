the armstrong limit or armstrongs line is a measure of altitude above which atmospheric pressure is sufficiently low that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body humans absolutely cannot survive above this limit in an unpressurized environment above earth this begins at 1819km 1112mi 5900062000ft above sea level the term is named after united states air force general harry george armstrong who was the first to recognize this phenomenon the relevant external pressure on the human body is 00618 atm 63 kpa 47 mmhg or about 1 psi effect on body fluids at or above the armstrong limit exposed body fluids such as saliva tears urine blood and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungsbut not vascular blood blood within the circulatory systemwill boil away without a full-body pressure suit and no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes the nasa technical report rapid explosive decompression emergencies in pressure-suited subjects which discusses the brief accidental exposure of a human to near vacuum notes the likely result of exposure to pressure below that associated with the armstrong limit the subject later reported that his last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil at the nominal body temperature of 37c 986f water has a vapour pressure of 63 kilopascals 47mmhg which is to say at an ambient pressure of 63 kilopascals 47mmhg the boiling point of water is 37c 986f a pressure of 63 kpathe armstrong limitis about 116 of the standard sea-level atmospheric pressure of 1013 kilopascals 760mmhg modern formulas for calculating the standard pressure at a given altitude varyas do the precise pressures one will actually measure at a given altitude on a given daybut a common formula shows that 63 kpa is typically found at an altitude of 19000m 62000ft blood pressure is a gauge pressure which means it is measured relative to ambient pressure to calculate blood pressure it has to be summed to ambient pressure for calculating when blood will boil this is similar to a flat automobile tire even with zero gauge pressure a flat tire at altitude of the armstrong limit would still have an absolute pressure pressure relative to a perfect vacuum of 63 hectopascals 091psi that is it will have the ambient pressure at the altitude where the 63 kpa pressure level occurs about 18km 60000ft both inside and out of it if one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge pressure this internal pressure is in addition to those 63 kilopascals 091psi of ambient pressure this means that for an individual with a diastolic low blood pressure typically 80kpa 60mmhg the persons blood pressure would be 143kpa 107mmhg the sum of the blood pressure and the ambient pressure this pressure is more than twice the ambient pressure at the armstrong limit this extra pressure is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at 18km 60000ft while the heart is still beating hypoxia below the armstrong limit well below the armstrong limit humans typically require supplemental oxygen in order to avoid hypoxia for most people this is typically needed at altitudes above 4500 m 15000 ft commercial jetliners are required to maintain cabin pressurization at a cabin altitude of not greater than 2400m 8000ft us regulations on general aviation aircraft non-airline non-government flights require that the minimum required flight crew but not the passengers be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends more than half an hour at a cabin altitude above 3800m 12500ft the minimum required flight crew must be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends any time above a cabin altitude of 4300m 14000ft and even the passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen above a cabin altitude of 4500m 15000ft skydivers who are at altitude only briefly before jumping do not normally exceed 4500m 15000ft historical significance the armstrong limit describes the altitude associated with an objective precisely defined natural phenomenon the vapor pressure of body-temperature water in the late 1940s it represented a new fundamental hard limit to altitude that went beyond the somewhat subjective observations of human physiology and the timedependent effects of hypoxia experienced at lower altitudes pressure suits had long been worn at altitudes well below the armstrong limit to avoid hypoxia in 1936 francis swain of the royal air force reached 15230m 49970ft flying a bristol type 138 while wearing a pressure suit two years later italian military officer mario pezzi set an altitude record of 17083m 56047ft wearing a pressure suit in his open-cockpit caproni ca161 biplane even though he was well below the altitude at which body-temperature water boils a pressure suit is normally required at around 15000m 49000ft for a well conditioned and experienced pilot to safely operate an aircraft in unpressurized cabins in an unpressurized cockpit at altitudes greater than 11900m 39000ft above sea level the physiological reaction even when breathing pure oxygen is hypoxiainadequate oxygen level causing confusion and eventual loss of consciousness air contains 2095 oxygen at 11900m 39000ft breathing pure oxygen through an unsealed face mask one is breathing the same partial pressure of oxygen as one would experience with regular air at around 3600m 11800ft above sea level at higher altitudes oxygen must be delivered through a sealed mask with increased pressure to maintain a physiologically adequate partial pressure of oxygen if the user does not wear a pressure suit or a counter-pressure garment that restricts the movement of their chest the high pressure air can cause damage to the lungs for modern military aircraft such as the united states f22 and f35 both of which have operational altitudes of 18000m 59000ft or more the pilot wears a counter-pressure garment which is a gsuit with high-altitude capabilities in the event the cockpit loses pressure the oxygen system switches to a positive-pressure mode to deliver above-ambient-pressure oxygen to a specially sealing mask as well as to proportionally inflate the counter-pressure garment the garment counters the outward expansion of the pilots chest to prevent pulmonary barotrauma until the pilot can descend to a safe altitude
