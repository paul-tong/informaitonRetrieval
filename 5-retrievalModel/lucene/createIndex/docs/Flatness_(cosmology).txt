the concept of curvature of space is fundamental to cosmology a space without curvature is called a flat space or euclidean space whether the universe is flat could determine its ultimate fate whether it will expand forever or ultimately collapse back into itself the geometry of spacetime has been measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap to be nearly flat according to the wmap 5-year results and analysis wmap determined that the universe is flat from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density within a 1 margin of error this is equivalent to a mass density of 99 10 gcm which is equivalent to only 59 protons per cubic meter the wmap data are consistent with a flat geometry with 102 - 002 httparchivencsauiuceducyberiacosmosflatnessproblemhtml
