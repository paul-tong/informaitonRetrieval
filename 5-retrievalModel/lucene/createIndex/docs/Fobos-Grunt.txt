fobos-grunt or phobos-grunt russian - literally phobos-ground was an attempted russian sample return mission to phobos one of the moons of mars fobos-grunt also carried the chinese mars orbiter yinghuo-1 and the tiny living interplanetary flight experiment funded by the planetary society it was launched on 9 november 2011 at 0216 local time 8 november 2011 2016 utc from the baikonur cosmodrome but subsequent rocket burns intended to set the craft on a course for mars failed leaving it stranded in low earth orbit efforts to reactivate the craft were unsuccessful and it fell back to earth in an uncontrolled re-entry on 15 january 2012 over the pacific ocean west of chile the return vehicle was to have returned to earth in august 2014 carrying up to 200g of soil from phobos funded by the russian federal space agency and developed by lavochkin and the russian space research institute fobos-grunt was the first russian-led interplanetary mission since the failed mars 96 the last successful interplanetary missions were the soviet vega 2 in 19851986 and the partially successful fobos 2 in 19881989 fobos-grunt was designed to become the first spacecraft to return a macroscopic sample from an extraterrestrial body since luna 24 in 1976 hayabusa returned microscopic grains of asteroid material in 2010 and stardust returned cometary dust in 2006 project history budget the cost of the project was 15 billion rubles 644 million usd project funding for the timeframe 20092012 including post-launch operations was about 24 billion rubles the total cost of the mission was to have been 5 billion rubles 163 million usd according to lead scientist alexander zakharov the entire spacecraft and most of the instruments were new though the designs drew upon the nations legacy of three successful luna missions which in the 1970s retrieved a few hundred grams of moon rocks zakharov had described the phobos sample return project as possibly the most difficult interplanetary one to date development the fobos-grunt project began in 1999 when the russian space research institute and npo lavochkin the main developer of soviet and russian interplanetary probes initiated a 9 million rouble feasibility study into a phobos sample-return mission the initial spacecraft design was to be similar to the probes of the fobos program launched in the late 1980s development of the spacecraft started in 2001 and the preliminary design was completed in 2004 for years the project stalled as a result of low levels of financing of the russian space program this changed in the summer of 2005 when the new government plan for space activities in 20062015 was published fobos-grunt was now made one of the programs flagship missions with substantially improved funding the launch date was set for october 2009 the 2004 design was revised a couple of times and international partners were invited to join the project in june 2006 npo lavochkin announced that it had begun manufacturing and testing the development version of the spacecrafts onboard equipment on 26 march 2007 russia and china signed a cooperative agreement on the joint exploration of mars which included sending chinas first interplanetary probe yinghuo-1 to mars together with the fobos-grunt spacecraft yinghuo-1 weighed 115kg 250pounds and would have been released by the main spacecraft into a mars orbit partners npo lavochkin was the projects main contractor developing its components the chief designer of fobos-grunt was maksim martynov phobos soil sampling and downloading were developed by the geohi ran institute of the russian academy of sciences vernadski institute of geochemistry and analytical chemistry and the integrated scientific studies of phobos and mars by remote and contact methods were the responsibility of the russian space research institute where alexander zakharov served as lead scientist of the mission the chinese yinghuo-1 orbiter was launched together with fobos-grunt in late 2012 after a 10115-month cruise yinghuo-1 would have separated and entered an 80080000km equatorial orbit 5 inclination with a period of three days the spacecraft was expected to remain on martian orbit for one year yinghuo-1 would have focused mainly on the study of the external environment of mars space center researchers expected to use photographs and data to study the magnetic field of mars and the interaction between ionospheres escape particles and solar wind a second chinese payload the soil offloading and preparation system sopsys was integrated in the lander sopsys was a microgravity grinding tool developed by the hong kong polytechnic university another payload on fobos-grunt was an experiment from the planetary society called living interplanetary flight experiment its goal was to test whether selected organisms can survive a few years in deep space by flying them through interplanetary space the experiment would have tested one aspect of transpermia the hypothesis that life could survive space travel if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another the bulgarian academy of sciences contributed with a radiation measurement experiment on fobos-grunt two metnet mars landers developed by the finnish meteorological institute were planned to be included as payload of the fobos-grunt mission but weight constraints on the spacecraft required dropping the metnet landers from the mission postponed 2009 launch the october 2009 launch date could not be achieved due to delays in the spacecraft development during 2009 officials admitted that the schedule was very tight but still hoped until the last moment that a launch could be made on 21 september 2009 the mission was officially announced to be delayed until the next launch window in 2011 a main reason for the delay was difficulties encountered during development of the spacecrafts onboard computers while the moscow-based company tehkhom provided the computer hardware on time the internal npo lavochkin team responsible for integration and software development fell behind schedule the retirement of npo lavochkins head valeriy n poletskiy in january 2010 was widely seen as linked to the delay of fobos-grunt viktor khartov was appointed the new head of the company during the extra development time resulting from the delay a polish-built drill was added to the phobos lander as a back-up soil extraction device 2011 launch the spacecraft arrived at baikonur cosmodrome on 17 october 2011 and was transported to site 31 for pre-launch processing the zenit-2sb41 rocket carrying fobos-grunt successfully lifted off from baikonur cosmodrome at 2016 utc on 8 november 2011 the zenit booster inserted the spacecraft into an initial 207km 347km 129mi 216mi elliptical low earth orbit with an inclination of 514 degrees two firings of the main propulsion unit in earth orbit were required to send the spacecraft onto the interplanetary trajectory since both engine ignitions would have taken place outside the range of russian ground stations the project participants asked volunteers around the world to take optical observations of the burns eg with telescopes and report the results to enable more accurate prediction of the mission flight path upon entry into the range of russian ground stations post-launch 1 baikonour launch 2 first burn 3 spent fuel tank ejected 4 second burn departure to martian system it was expected that after 25 hours and 17 revolutions in the initial orbit the autonomous main propulsion unit mdu derived from the fregat upper stage would conduct its firing to insert the spacecraft into the elliptical orbit 250km x 41504170km with a period of about 22 hours after the completion of the first burn the external fuel tank of the propulsion unit was expected to be jettisoned with ignition for a second burn to depart earth orbit scheduled for one orbit or 21 hours after the end of the first burn the propulsion module constitutes the cruise-stage bus of fobos-grunt according to original plans mars orbit arrival had been expected during september 2012 and the return vehicle was scheduled to reach earth in august 2014 following what would have been the planned end of the first burn the spacecraft could not be located in the target orbit the spacecraft was subsequently discovered to still be in its initial parking orbit and it was determined that the burn had not taken place initially engineers had about three days from launch to rescue the spacecraft before its batteries ran out it was then established that the crafts solar panels had deployed giving engineers more time to restore control it was soon discovered the spacecraft was adjusting its orbit changing its expected re-entry from late november or december to as late as early 2012 even though it had not been contacted the spacecraft seemed to be actively adjusting its perigee the point it is closest to earth in its orbit contact on 22 november 2011 a signal from the probe was picked up by the european space agencys tracking station in perth australia after it had sent the probe the command to turn on one of its transmitters the european space operations centre esoc in darmstadt germany reported that the contact was made at 2025 utc on 22 november 2011 after some modifications had been made to the 15m dish facility in perth to improve its chances of getting a signal no telemetry was received in this communication it remained unclear whether the communications link would have been sufficient to command the spacecraft to switch on its engines to take it on its intended trajectory toward mars roscosmos officials said that the window of opportunity to salvage fobos-grunt would close in early december the next day on 23 november the perth station again made contact with the spacecraft and during 6 minutes about 400 telemetry frames and doppler information were received the amount of information received during this communication was not sufficient and therefore it was not possible to identify the problem with the probe further communication attempts made by esa were unsuccessful and contact was not reestablished the space vehicle did not respond to the commands sent by the european space agency to raise its orbit roscosmos provided these commands to esa from baikonour kazakhstan roscosmos was able to receive telemetry from fobos-grunt on 24 november but attempts to contact it failed this telemetry demonstrated that the probes radio equipment was working and that it was communicating with the spacecrafts flight control systems moreover roscosmoss top officials believed fobos-grunt to be functional stably oriented and charging batteries through its solar panels in a late november 2011 interview the service manager of the european space agency for fobos-grunt wolfgang hell stated that roscosmos had a better understanding of the problem with the spacecraft saying they reached the conclusion that they have some kind of power problem on board esa failed to communicate with the space probe in all of the five opportunities the agency had between 28 and 29 november during those occasions the spacecraft did not comply with orders to fire the engines and raise its orbit the russian space agency then requested that esa repeat the orders the european space agency decided to end the efforts to contact the probe on 2 december 2011 with one analyst saying fobos-grunt appeared dead in the water however esa made teams available to assist the fobos-grunt mission if there was a change in situation in spite of that roscosmos stated their intention to continue to try to contact the space vehicle until it entered the atmosphere the us strategic commands joint space operations center jspoc tracked the probe and identified at the start of december that fobos-grunt had an elliptical orbit at an altitude of between 209 kilometres 130mi and 305 kilometres 190mi but falling a few miles each day re-entry before reentry the spacecraft still carried about 751 metric tonnes of highly toxic hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide on board this was mostly fuel for the spacecrafts upper stage these compounds with melting points of 2 c and 112 c are normally kept in liquid form and were expected to burn out during re-entry nasa veteran james oberg said the hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide could freeze before ultimately entering thus contaminating the impact area he also stated that if fobos-grunt is not salvaged it may be the most dangerous object to fall from orbit meanwhile the head of roscosmos said the probability of parts reaching the earth surface was highly unlikely and that the spacecraft including the life module and the yinghuo-1 orbiter would be destroyed during re-entry russian military sources claimed that fobos-grunt was somewhere over the pacific ocean between new zealand and south america when it re-entered the atmosphere at about 1745 utc although it was initially feared its remains would reach land as close as 145km west of santa fe argentina the russian military air and space defense forces reported that it ultimately fell into the pacific ocean 775 miles 1247km west of wellington island chile the defence ministry spokesman subsequently revealed that such estimate was based on calculations without witness reports in contrast russian civilian ballistic experts said that the fragments had fallen over a broader patch of earths surface and that the midpoint of the crash zone was located in the gois state of brazil aftermath initially the head of roscosmos vladimir popovkin suggested that the fobos-grunt failure might have been the result of sabotage by a foreign nation he also stated that risky technical decisions had been made because of limited funding on 17 january 2012 an unidentified russian official speculated that a us radar stationed on the marshall islands may have inadvertently disabled the probe but cited no evidence popovkin suggested the microchips may have been counterfeit then he announced on 1 february that a burst of cosmic radiation may have caused computers to reboot and go into a standby mode industry experts cast doubt on the claim citing how unlikely the effects of such a burst are in low earth orbit inside the protection of earths magnetic field on 6 february 2012 the commission investigating the mishap concluded that fobos-grunt mission failed because of a programming error which led to a simultaneous reboot of two working channels of an onboard computer the crafts rocket pack never fired due to the computer reboot leaving the craft stranded in earth orbit although the specific failure was identified experts suggest it was the culmination of poor quality control lack of testing and corruption russian president dmitry medvedev suggested that those responsible should be punished and perhaps criminally prosecuted repeat mission in january 2012 scientists and engineers at the russian space research institute and npo lavochkin called for a repeat sample return mission called fobos-grunt-2 and boomerang for launch in 2020 popovkin declared that they would soon attempt to repeat the fobos-grunt mission if an agreement was not reached for russian co-operation in the european space agencys exomars program however since an agreement was reached for the inclusion of russia as a full project partner some instruments originally developed for fobos-grunt were flown in the exomars trace gas orbiter on 2 august 2014 the russian academy of sciences stated that the phobos-grunt repeat mission might be restarted for a launch approximately in 2024 in august 2015 the esa-roscosmos working group on post-exomars cooperation completed a joint study for a possible future phobos sample return mission preliminary discussions were held and in may 2015 the russian academy of sciences submitted a budget proposal roscosmos is also currently studying a proposal for an international mars sample return mission called mars-grunt to take place by 2026 this mars sample-return mission would be developed from the technologies demonstrated by fobos-grunt 2 objectives fobos-grunt was an intended interplanetary probe that included a lander to study phobos and a sample return vehicle to return a sample of about 200g 71oz of soil to earth it was also to study mars from orbit including its atmosphere and dust storms plasma and radiation delivery of samples of phobos soil to earth for scientific research of phobos mars and martian vicinity in situ and remote studies of phobos to include analysis of soil samples monitoring the atmospheric behavior of mars including the dynamics of dust storms studies of the vicinity of mars including its radiation environment plasma and dust study of the origin of the martian moons and their relation to mars study of the role played by asteroid impacts in the formation of terrestrial planets search for possible past or present life biosignatures study of the impact of a three-year interplanetary round-trip journey on extremophile microorganisms in a small sealed capsule life experiment payload tv system for navigation and guidance gas-chromatograph package thermal differential analyzer gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer thermal differential analyzer gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer gamma ray spectrometer neutron spectrometer alpha x spectrometer seismometer long-wave radar visual and near-infrared spectrometer dust counter ion spectrometer optical solar sensor mass summary mission plan journey the spacecrafts journey to mars would take about ten months after arriving in mars orbit the main propulsion unit and the transfer truss would separate and the chinese mars orbiter would be released fobos-grunt would then spend several months studying the planet and its moons from orbit before landing on phobos it was imperative to prevent the introduction to mars of contaminants from earth according to fobos-grunt chief designer maksim martynov the probability of the probe accidentally reaching the surface of mars was much lower than the maximum specified for categoryiii missions the type assigned to fobos-grunt and defined in cospars planetary protection policy in accordance with article ix of the outer space treaty on phobos the planned landing site at phobos was a region from 5s to 5n 230 to 235e soil sample collection would begin immediately after the lander touched down on phobos with collection lasting 27 days an emergency mode existed for the case of communications breakdown which enabled the lander to automatically launch the return rocket to deliver the samples to earth a robotic arm would have collected samples up to 05 inches 13cm in diameter at the end of the arm was a pipe-shaped tool which split to form a claw the tool contained a piston which would have pushed the sample into a cylindrical container a light-sensitive photo-diode would have confirmed whether material collection was successful and also allowed visual inspection of the digging area the sample extraction device would have performed 15 to 20 scoops yielding a total of 3 to 55 ounces 85 to 156g of soil the samples would be loaded into a capsule which would then be moved inside a special pipeline into the descent module by inflating an elastic bag within the pipe with gas because the characteristics of phobos soil are uncertain the lander included another soil-extraction device a polish-built drill which would have been used in case the soil turned out to be too rocky for the main scooping device after the departure of the return stage the landers experiments would have continued in situ on phobos surface for a year to conserve power mission control would have turned these on and off in a precise sequence the robotic arm would have placed more samples in a chamber that would heat it and analyze its emission spectra this analysis might have been able to determine the presence of volatile compounds such as water sample return to earth the return stage was mounted on top of the lander it would have needed to accelerate to 35kmh 22mph to escape phobos gravity in order to avoid harming the experiments remaining at the lander the return stage would have ignited its engine once the vehicle had been vaulted to a safe height by springs it would then have begun maneuvers for the eventual trip to earth where it would have arrived in august 2014 an 11-kg descent vehicle containing the capsule with soil samples up to 02kg 044lb would have been released on direct approach to earth at 12kms 75mis following the aerodynamic braking to 30ms 98fts the conical-shaped descent vehicle would perform a hard landing without a parachute within the sary shagan test range in kazakhstan the vehicle did not have any radio equipment ground-based radar and optical observations would have been used to track the vehicles return summary of intended mission phases ground control the mission control center was located at the center for deep space communications in russian in ukrainian equipped with rt-70 radio telescope near yevpatoria in crimea ukraine russia and ukraine agreed in late october 2010 that the european space operations centre in darmstadt germany would have controlled the probe communications with the spacecraft on the initial parking orbit are described in a two-volume publication scientific critiques barry e digregorio director of the international committee against mars sample return icamsr criticised the life experiment carried by fobos-grunt as a violation of the outer space treaty due to the possibility of contamination of phobos or mars with the microbial spores and live bacteria it contains should it have lost control and crash-landed on either body it is speculated that the heat-resistant extremophile bacteria could survive such a crash on the basis that microbispora bacteria survived the space shuttle columbia disaster according to fobos-grunt chief designer maksim martynov the probability of the probe accidentally reaching the surface of mars was much lower than the maximum specified for categoryiii missions the type assigned to fobos-grunt and defined in cospars planetary protection policy in accordance with article ix of the outer space
