non-rocket spacelaunch refers to concepts for launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than rockets or by other than expendable rockets a number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed in some systems such as a combination launch system skyhook rocket sled launch rockoon or air launch a rocket would be part but only part of the system used to reach orbit present-day launch costs are very high 2500 to 25000 per kilogram from earth to low earth orbit leo as a result launch costs are a large percentage of the cost of all space endeavors if launch can be made cheaper the total cost of space missions will be reduced due to the exponential nature of the rocket equation providing even a small amount of the velocity to leo by other means has the potential of greatly reducing the cost of getting to orbit launch costs in the hundreds of dollars per kilogram would make possible many proposed large-scale space projects such as space colonization space-based solar power and terraforming mars comparison of space launch methods static structures in this usage the term static is intended to convey the understanding that the structural portion of the system has no internal moving parts space tower a space tower is a tower that would reach outer space to avoid an immediate need for a vehicle launched at orbital velocity to raise its perigee a tower would have to extend above the edge of space above the 100km krmn line but a far lower tower height could reduce atmospheric drag losses during ascent if the tower went all the way to geosynchronous orbit at approximately 36000km or 22369 miles objects released at such height could then drift away with minimal power and would be in a circular orbit the concept of a structure reaching to geosynchronous orbit was first conceived by konstantin tsiolkovsky the original concept envisioned by tsiolkovsky was a compression structure building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles the vehicle is elevated up the tower which may extend above the atmosphere and is launched from the top such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of 20km 12mi has been proposed by various researchers tensile structures tensile structures for non-rocket spacelaunch are proposals to use long very strong cables known as tethers to lift a payload into space tethers can also be used for changing orbit once in space orbital tethers can be tidally locked skyhook or rotating rotovators they can be designed in theory to pick up the payload when the payload is stationary or when the payload is hypersonic has a high but not orbital velocity endo-atmospheric tethers can be used to transfer kinetics energy and momentum between large conventional aircraft subsonic or low supersonic or other motive force and smaller aerodynamic vehicles propelling them to hypersonic velocities without exotic propulsion systems skyhook a skyhook is a theoretical class of orbiting tether propulsion intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds proposals for skyhooks include designs that employ tethers spinning at hypersonic speed for catching high speed payloads or high altitude aircraft and placing them in orbit space elevator a space elevator is a proposed type of space transportation system its main component is a ribbon-like cable also called a tether anchored to the surface and extending into space above the level of geosynchronous orbit as the planet rotates the centrifugal force at the upper end of the tether counteracts gravity and keeps the cable taut vehicles can then climb the tether and reach orbit without the use of rocket propulsion such a cable could be made out of any material able to support itself under tension by tapering the cables diameter sufficiently quickly as it approached the earths surface on earth with its relatively strong gravity current materials are not sufficiently strong and light with conventional materials the taper ratio would need to be very large increasing the total launch mass to a fiscally infeasible degree however carbon nanotube or boron nitride nanotube based materials have been proposed as the tensile element in the tether design their measured strengths are high compared to their linear densities they hold promise as materials to make an earth-based space elevator possible landis and cafarelli suggested that a tension structure space elevator extending downward from geosynchronous orbit could be combined with the compression structure tsiolkovski tower extending upward from the surface forming the combined structure reaching geosynchronous orbit from the surface and having structural advantages over either one individually the space elevator concept is also applicable to other planets and celestial bodies for locations in the solar system with weaker gravity than earths such as the moon or mars the strength-to-density requirements arent as great for tether materials currently available materials such as kevlar could serve as the tether material for elevators there endo-atmospheric tethers an endo-atmospheric tether uses the long cable within the atmosphere to provide some or all of the velocity needed to reach orbit the tether is used to transfer kinetics energy and momentum from a massive slow end typically a large subsonic or low supersonic aircraft to a hypersonic end through aerodynamics or centripetal action the kinetics interchange tether kite launcher is one proposed endo-atmospheric tether dynamic structures space fountain a space fountain is a proposed form of space elevator that does not require the structure to be in geosynchronous orbit and does not rely on tensile strength for support in contrast to the original space elevator design a tethered satellite a space fountain is a tremendously tall tower extending up from the ground since such a tall tower could not support its own weight using traditional materials massive pellets are projected upward from the bottom of the tower and redirected back down once they reach the top so that the force of redirection holds the top of the tower aloft orbital ring an orbital ring is a concept for a space elevator that consists of a ring in lowearth orbit that rotates at slightly above orbital speed and has fixed tethers hanging down to the ground the first design of an orbital ring offered by a yunitsky in 1982 in the 1982 paul birch jbis design of an orbital ring system a rotating cable is placed in a low earth orbit rotating at slightly faster than orbital speed not in orbit but riding on this ring supported electromagnetically on superconducting magnets are ring stations that stay in one place above some designated point on earth hanging down from these ring stations are short space elevators made from cables with high tensile-strength-to-mass ratio birch claimed that the ring stations in addition to holding the tether could accelerate the orbital ring eastwards causing it to precess around earth if it were possible to make the precession rate large enough once per day the rate of rotation of the earth the ring would be geostationary without having to be at the normal geostationary altitude or even in the equatorial plane launch loop a launch loop or lofstrom loop is a design for a belt-based maglev orbital launch system that would be around 2000km long and maintained at an altitude of up to 80km 50mi vehicles weighing 5 metric tons would be electromagnetically accelerated on top of the cable which forms an acceleration track from which they would be projected into earth orbit or even beyond the structure would constantly need around 200 mw of power to keep it in place the system is designed to be suitable for launching humans for space tourism space exploration and space colonization with a maximum of 3g acceleration some other launch loops are developed in pneumatic freestanding tower one proposed design is a freestanding tower composed of high strength material eg kevlar tubular columns inflated with a low density gas mix and with dynamic stabilization systems including gyroscopes and pressure balancing suggested benefits in contrast to other space elevator designs include avoiding working with the great lengths of structure involved in some other designs construction from the ground instead of orbit and functional access to the entire range of altitudes within the designs practical reach the design presented is at 5 km altitude and extending to 20km above sea level and the authors suggest that the approach may be further scaled to provide direct access to altitudes above 200km a major difficulty of such a tower is buckling since it is a long slender construction projectile launchers with any of these projectile launchers the launcher gives a high velocity at or near ground level in order to achieve orbit the projectile must be given enough extra velocity to punch through the atmosphere unless it includes an additional propulsion system such as a rocket also the projectile needs either an internal or external means to perform orbital insertion the designs below fall into three categories electrically driven chemically driven and mechanically driven electromagnetic acceleration electrical launch systems include mass drivers railguns and coilguns all of these systems use the concept of a stationary launch track which uses some form of linear electrical motor to accelerate a projectile mass driver a mass driver is basically a very long and mainly horizontally aligned launch track or tunnel for space launch curved upwards at the end the concept was proposed by arthur c clarke in 1950 and was developed in more detail by gerard k oneill working with the space studies institute focusing on the use of a mass driver for launching material from the moon a mass driver uses some sort of repulsion to keep a payload separated from the track or walls then it uses a linear motor an alternating-current motor such as in a coil gun or a homopolar motor as in a railgun to accelerate the payload to high speeds after leaving the launch track the payload would be at its launch velocity startram startram is a proposal to launch vehicles directly to space by accelerating them with a mass driver vehicles would float by maglev repulsion between superconductive magnets on the vehicle and the aluminum tunnel walls while they were accelerated by ac magnetic drive from aluminum coils the power required would probably be provided by superconductive energy storage units distributed along the tunnel vehicles could coast up to low or even geosynchronous orbital height then a small rocket motor burn would be required to circularize the orbit cargo-only generation 1 systems would accelerate at 1020 gs and exit from a mountain top while not suitable for passengers they could put cargo into orbit for 40 per kilogram 100 times cheaper than rockets passenger-capable generation 2 systems would accelerate for a much longer distance at 2 gs the vehicles would enter the atmosphere at an altitude of 20km from an evacuated tunnel restrained by kevlar tethers and supported by magnetic repulsion between superconducting cables in the tunnel and on the ground for both gen 12 systems the mouth of the tube would be open during vehicle acceleration with air kept out by magnetohydrodynamic pumping chemical space gun a space gun is a proposed method of launching an object into outer space using a large gun or cannon science fiction writer jules verne proposed such a launch method in from the earth to the moon and in 1902 a movie a trip to the moon was adapted however even with a gun barrel through both the earths crust and troposphere the g-forces required to generate escape velocity would still be more than what a human tolerates therefore the space gun would be restricted to freight and ruggedized satellites also the projectile needs either an internal or external means to stabilize on orbit gun launch concepts do not always use combustion in pneumatic launch systems a projectile is accelerated in a long tube by air pressure produced by ground-based turbines or other means in a light-gas gun the pressurant is a gas of light molecular weight to maximize the speed of sound in the gas in the 1990s john hunter of quicklaunch proposed use of a hydrogen gun to launch unmanned payloads to orbit for less than the regular launch costs ram accelerator a ram accelerator also uses chemical energy like the space gun but it is entirely different in that it relies on a jet-engine-like propulsion cycle utilizing ramjet andor scramjet combustion processes to accelerate the projectile to extremely high speeds it is a long tube filled with a mixture of combustible gases with a frangible diaphragm at either end to contain the gases the projectile which is shaped like a ram jet core is fired by another means eg a space gun discussed above supersonically through the first diaphragm into the end of the tube it then burns the gases as fuel accelerating down the tube under jet propulsion other physics come into play at higher velocities blast wave accelerator a blast wave accelerator is similar to a space gun but it differs in that rings of explosive along the length of the barrel are detonated in sequence to keep the accelerations high also rather than just relying on the pressure behind the projectile the blast wave accelerator specifically times the explosions to squeeze on a tail cone on the projectile as one might shoot a pumpkin seed by squeezing the tapered end mechanical slingatron in a slingatron projectiles are accelerated along a rigid tube or track that typically has circular or spiral turns or combinations of these geometries in two or three dimensions a projectile is accelerated in the curved tube by propelling the entire tube in a small-amplitude circular motion of constant or increasing frequency without changing the orientation of the tube ie the entire tube gyrates but does not spin an everyday example of this motion is stirring a beverage by holding the container and moving it in small horizontal circles causing the contents to spin without spinning the container itself this gyration continually displaces the tube with a component along the direction of the centripetal force acting on the projectile so that work is continually done on the projectile as it advances through the machine the centripetal force experienced by the projectile is the accelerating force and is proportional to the projectile mass air launch in air launch a carrier aircraft carries the space vehicle to high altitude and speed before release this technique was used on the suborbital x-15 and spaceshipone vehicles and for the pegasus orbital launch vehicle the main disadvantages are that the carrier aircraft tends to be quite large and separation within the airflow at supersonic speeds has never been demonstrated thus the boost given is relatively modest spaceplanes a spaceplane is an aircraft designed to pass the edge of space it combines some features of an aircraft with some of a spacecraft typically it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with aerodynamic surfaces one or more rocket engines and sometimes additional airbreathing propulsion as well early spaceplanes were used to explore hypersonic flight eg x-15 some air-breathing engine-based designs cf x-30 such as aircraft based on scramjets or pulse detonation engines could potentially achieve orbital velocity or go some useful way to doing so however these designs still must perform a final rocket burn at their apogee to circularize their trajectory to avoid returning to the atmosphere other reusable turbojet-like designs like skylon which uses precooled jet engines up to mach55 before employing rockets to enter orbit appears to have a mass budget that permits a larger payload than pure rockets while achieving it in a single stage balloon balloons can raise the initial altitude of rockets however balloons have relatively low payload although see the sky cat project for an example of a heavy-lift balloon intended for use in the lower atmosphere and this decreases even more with increasing altitude the lifting gas could be helium or hydrogen helium is not only expensive in large quantities but is also a nonrenewable resource this makes balloons an expensive launch assist technique hydrogen could be used as it has the advantage of being cheaper and lighter than helium but the disadvantage of also being highly flammable rockets launched from balloons known as rockoons have been demonstrated but to date only for suborbital sounding rocket missions the size of balloon that would be required to lift an orbital launch vehicle would be extremely large one prototype of a balloon launch platform has been made by jp aerospace as project tandem although it has not been used as a rocket launch vehicle jp aerospace further proposes a hypersonic lighter than air upper stage a spanish company zero2infinity is officially developing a launcher system called bloostar based on the rockoon concept expected to be operational by 2018 gerard k oneill proposed that by using very large balloons it may be possible to construct a space port in the stratosphere rockets could launch from it or a mass driver could accelerate payloads into the orbit this has the advantage that most about 90 of the atmosphere is below the space port a spaceshaft is a proposed version of an atmospherically buoyant structure that would serve as a system to lift cargo to near-space altitudes with platforms distributed at several elevations that would provide habitation facilities for long term human operations throughout the mid-atmosphere and near-space altitudes for space launch it would serve as a non-rocket first stage for rockets launched from the top hybrid launch systems separate technologies may be combined in 2010 nasa suggested that a future scramjet aircraft might be accelerated to 300ms a solution to the problem of ramjet engines not being startable at zero airflow velocity by electromagnetic or other sled launch assist in turn air-launching a second-stage rocket delivering a satellite to orbit all forms of projectile launchers are at least partially hybrid systems if launching to low earth orbit due to the requirement for orbit circularization at a minimum entailing several percent of total delta-v to raise perigee eg a tiny rocket burn or in some concepts much more from a rocket thruster to ease ground accelerator development some technologies can have exponential scaling if used in isolation making the effect of combinations be of counter-intuitive magnitude for instance 270ms is under 4 of the velocity of low earth orbit but a nasa study estimated that maglifter sled launch at that velocity could increase the payload of a conventional elv rocket by 80 when also having the track go up a 3000meter mountain forms of ground launch limited to a given maximum acceleration such as due to human g-force tolerances if intended to carry passengers have the corresponding minimum launcher length scale not linearly but with velocity squared tethers can have even more non-linear exponential scaling the tether-to-payload mass ratio of a space tether would be around 11 at a tip velocity 60 of its characteristic velocity but becomes more than 10001 at a tip velocity 240 of its characteristic velocity for instance for anticipated practicality and a moderate mass ratio with current materials the hastol concept would have the first half 4kms of velocity to orbit be provided by other means than the tether itself a proposal to use a hybrid system combining a mass driver for initial lofting followed by additive thrust by a series of ground-based lasers sequenced according to wavelength was proposed by mashall savage in the book the millennial project as one of the core theses of the book but the idea has not been pursued to any notable degree savages specific proposals proved to be infeasible on both engineering and political grounds and while the difficulties could be overcome the group savage founded now called the living universe foundation has been unable to raise significant funds for research combining multiple technologies would in itself be an increase to complexity and development challenges but reducing the performance requirements of a given subsystem may allow reduction in its individual complexity or cost for instance the number of parts in a liquid-fueled rocket engine may be two orders of magnitude less if pressure-fed rather than pump-fed if its delta-v requirements are limited enough to make the weight penalty of such be a practical option or a high-velocity ground launcher may be able to use a relatively moderate performance and inexpensive solid fuel or hybrid small motor on its projectile assist by non-rocket methods may compensate against the weight penalty of making an orbital rocket reusable though suborbital the first private manned spaceship spaceshipone had reduced rocket performance requirements due to being a combined system with its air launch see also spaceflight portal science portal air launch to orbit
