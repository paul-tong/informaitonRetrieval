diffuse sky radiation is solar radiation reaching the earths surface after having been scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or particulates in the atmosphere also called sky radiation diffuse skylight or just skylight it is the reason for the color changes of the sky of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere approximately 25 of the incident radiation when and where the sun is high in the sky depending on the amount of dust haze and other particulates in the atmosphere about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation when the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky with 1361wm above the atmosphere direct sunlight is about 1050wm and total insolation about 1120wm this implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70wm out of the original 1361wm the dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere rayleigh scattering and mie scattering are elastic in nature by which light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and with no change in wavelength color the sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths since blue light is at the short-wavelength end of the visible spectrum it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long-wavelength red light the result is that when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun the human eye perceives them to be blue the color perceived is similar to that obtained by a monochromatic blue of a wavelength of 474476 nm mixed with white light ie an unsaturated blue light the explanation of the blue color by rayleigh in 1871 is one of the most famous examples of the application of dimensional analysis in solving a problem in physics near sunrise and sunset most of the sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to the earths surface thus the lights path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out along the way leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red therefore when looking at the sunset and sunrise we see the color red more than the other colors scattering and absorption are major causes of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation when this ratio is less than about one-tenth rayleigh scattering occurs in this case the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength at larger ratios scattering varies in a complex fashion described for spherical particles by the mie theory the laws of geometric optics begin to apply at a ratio of the order of 10 in the example of the sky at the zenith it is blue during broad daylight due to rayleigh scattering involving diatomic gases n 2 o 2 near sunset and especially during twilight ozone o 3 absorption significantly contributes to maintaining the skys blue color neutral points there are four commonly detectable points of zero polarization of diffuse sky radiation known as neutral points lying along the vertical circle through the sun the arago point named after its discoverer is customarily located at about 20 above the antisolar point but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air the latter property makes the arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric turbidity the babinet point discovered by jacques babinet in 1840 is located about 15 to 20 above the sun hence it is difficult to observe because of solar glare the brewster point discovered by david brewster in 1840 is located about 15 to 20 below the sun hence it is difficult to observe because of solar glare the fourth point located at about 20 below the antisolar point visible only at higher altitudes in the air or in space under an overcast sky there is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky so all light is then diffuse sky radiation the flux of light is not very wavelength-dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the lights wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally the light passes through the translucent clouds in a manner similar to frosted glass the intensity ranges roughly from 6 of direct sunlight for relatively thin clouds down to 1000 of direct sunlight under the extreme of thickest storm clouds as a part of total radiation one of the equations for total solar radiation is where hb is the beam radiation irradiance rb is the tilt factor for beam radiation hd is the diffuse radiation irradiance rd is the tilt factor for diffuse radiation and rr is the tilt factor for reflected radiation rb is given by where is the solar declination is the latitude is an angle from the horizontal and h is the solar hour angle rd is given by and rr by where is the reflectivity of the surface eruption of mt pinatubo and agriculture the eruption of the philippines volcano - mount pinatubo in june 1991 ejected roughly 10km 24cumi of magma and 17000000 metric tons17 teragrams of sulfur dioxide so2 into the air introducing ten times as much total so2 as the 1991 kuwaiti fires mostly during the explosive plinianultra-plinian event of june 15 1991 creating a global stratospheric so2 haze layer which persisted for years this resulted in the global average temperature dropping by about 05c 09f as volcanic ash falls out of the atmosphere rapidly the negative agricultural effects of the eruption were largely immediate and localized to a relatively small area in close proximity to the eruption as they were caused by the resulting thick ash cover that resulted globally however despite a several-month 5 drop in overall solar irradiation and a reduction in direct sunlight by 30 there was no negative impact to global agriculture surprisingly a 3-4 year increase in global agricultural productivity and forestry growth was observed excepting boreal forest regions the means by which this was discovered is that initially at the time a mysterious drop in the rate at which carbon dioxide co2 was filling the atmosphere was observed which is charted in what is known as the keeling curve this led numerous scientists to assume that this reduction was due to the lowering of the earths temperature and with that a slow down in plant and soil respiration indicating a deleterious impact to global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer however upon actual investigation the reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide filled the atmosphere did not match up with the hypothesis that plant respiration rates had declined instead the advantageous anomaly was relatively firmly linked to an unprecedented increase in the growthnet primary production of global plant life resulting in the increase of the carbon sink effect of global photosynthesis the mechanism by which the increase in plant growth was possible was that the 30 reduction of direct sunlight can also be expressed as an increase or enhancement in the amount of diffuse sunlight this diffuse light owing to its intrinsic nature can illuminate under-canopy leaves permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies and the direct sunlight that results from it which casts shadows onto understorey leaves strictly limiting plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer this increase in global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer also naturally results as a product of other aerosols that are not emitted by volcanoes such as man-made moderately thick smoke loading pollution as the same mechanism the aerosol direct radiative effect is behind both see also atmospheric diffraction aerial perspective cyanometer daylight nighttime airglow rayleigh scattering rayleigh sky model sunshine duration tyndall effect pesic peter 2005 sky in a bottle the mit press isbn978-0-262-16234-0 dr c v raman lecture why is the sky blue why is the sky blue blue sky and rayleigh scattering atmospheric optics pdf dr craig bohren
