been a part of modern russia since the 16th and 17th centuries the territory of siberia extends eastwards from the ural mountains to the watershed between the pacific and arctic drainage basins the yenisei river conditionally divides siberia into two parts western and eastern siberia stretches southwards from the arctic ocean to the hills of north-central kazakhstan and to the national borders of mongolia and china with an area of 131million square kilometres 5100000sqmi siberia accounts for 77 of russias land area but it is home to approximately 36 million people27 of the countrys population this is equivalent to an average population density of about 3 inhabitants per square kilometre 78sqmi approximately equal to that of australia making siberia one of the most sparsely populated regions on earth if it were a country by itself it would still be the largest country in area but in population it would be the worlds 35th-largest and asias 14th-largest worldwide siberia is well known primarily for its long harsh winters with a january average of 25c 13f as well as its extensive history of use by russian and soviet administrations as a place for prisons labor camps and exile etymology the origin of the name is unknown some sources say that siberia originates from the siberian tatar word for sleeping land sib ir another account sees the name as the ancient tribal ethnonym of the sirtyaru also syopyr spr an ethnic group which spoke a paleosiberian language the sirtya people were later assimilated into the siberian tatars the modern usage of the name was recorded in the russian language after the empires conquest of the siberian khanate a further variant claims that the region was named after the xibe people the polish historian chycliczkowski has proposed that the name derives from the proto-slavic word for north sever but anatole baikaloff has dismissed this explanation he said that the neighbouring chinese turks and mongolians who have similar names for the region would not have known russian he suggests that the name might be a combination of two words with turkic origin su water and bir wild land prehistory the region has paleontological significance as it contains bodies of prehistoric animals from the pleistocene epoch preserved in ice or in permafrost specimens of goldfuss cave lion cubs yuka mammoth and another woolly mammoth from oymyakon a woolly rhinoceros from the kolyma river and bison and horses from yukagir have been found the siberian traps were formed by one of the largest-known volcanic events of the last 500million years of earths geological history their activity continued for a million years and some scientists consider it a possible cause of the great dying about 250million years ago estimated to have killed 90 of species existing at the time at least three species of human lived in southern siberia around 40000 years ago h sapiens h neanderthalensis and the denisovans in 2010 dna evidence identified the last as a separate species history siberia was inhabited by different groups of nomads such as the enets the nenets the huns the scythians and the uyghurs the khan of sibir in the vicinity of modern tobolsk was known as a prominent figure who endorsed kubrat as khagan of old great bulgaria in 630 the mongols conquered a large part of this area early in the 13th century with the breakup of the golden horde the autonomous khanate of sibir was established in the late 15th century turkic-speaking yakut migrated north from the lake baikal region under pressure from the mongol tribes during the 13th to 15th century siberia remained a sparsely populated area historian john f richards wrote it is doubtful that the total early modern siberian population exceeded 300000 persons the growing power of russia in the west began to undermine the siberian khanate in the 16th century first groups of traders and cossacks began to enter the area the russian army was directed to establish forts farther and farther east to protect new settlers from european russia towns such as mangazeya tara yeniseysk and tobolsk were developed the last being declared the capital of siberia at this time sibir was the name of a fortress at qashlik near tobolsk gerardus mercator in a map published in 1595 marks sibier both as the name of a settlement and of the surrounding territory along a left tributary of the ob other sources contend that the xibe an indigenous tungusic people offered fierce resistance to russian expansion beyond the urals some suggest that the term siberia is a russification of their ethnonym by the mid-17th century russia had established areas of control that extended to the pacific some 230000 russians had settled in siberia by 1709 siberia was a destination for sending exiles the first great modern change in siberia was the trans-siberian railway constructed during 18911916 it linked siberia more closely to the rapidly industrialising russia of nicholas ii around seven million people moved to siberia from european russia between 1801 and 1914 from 1859 to 1917 more than half a million people migrated to the russian far east siberia has extensive natural resources during the 20th century large-scale exploitation of these was developed and industrial towns cropped up throughout the region at 715am on 30 june 1908 millions of trees were felled near the podkamennaya tunguska stony tunguska river in central siberia in the tunguska event most scientists believe this resulted from the air burst of a meteor or a comet even though no crater has ever been found the landscape in the sparsely inhabited area still bears the scars of this event in the early decades of the soviet union especially the 1930s and 1940s the government established the gulag state agency to administer a system of penal labour camps replacing the previous katorga system according to semi-official soviet estimates which were not made public until after the fall of the soviet government from 1929 to 1953 more than 14 million people passed through these camps and prisons many of which were in siberia another seven to eight million people were internally deported to remote areas of the soviet union including entire nationalities or ethnicities in several cases half a million 516841 prisoners died in camps from 1941 to 1943 due to food shortages caused by world war ii at other periods mortality was comparatively lower the size scope and scale of the gulag slave labour camps remains a subject of much research and debate many gulag camps were positioned in extremely remote areas of northeastern siberia the best known clusters are sevvostlag the north-east camps along the kolyma river and norillag near norilsk where 69000 prisoners were kept in 1952 major industrial cities of northern siberia such as norilsk and magadan developed from camps built by prisoners and run by former prisoners geography with an area of 131million square kilometres 5100000sqmi siberia makes up roughly 77 of russias total territory and almost 10 of earths land surface 148940000km 57510000sqmi while siberia falls entirely within asia many authorities such as the un geoscheme will not subdivide countries and will place all of russia as part of europe andor eastern europe major geographical zones include the west siberian plain and the central siberian plateau eastern and central sakha comprises numerous north-south mountain ranges of various ages these mountains extend up to almost 3000 metres 9800ft but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation the verkhoyansk range was extensively glaciated in the pleistocene but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations at these low elevations are numerous valleys many of them deep and covered with larch forest except in the extreme north where the tundra dominates soils are mainly turbels a type of gelisol the active layer tends to be less than one metre deep except near rivers the highest point in siberia is the active volcano klyuchevskaya sopka on the kamchatka peninsula its peak is at 4750 metres 15580ft mountain ranges altai mountains anadyr range baikal mountains chamar-daban chersky range dzhugdzhur mountains gydan mountains koryak mountains sayan mountains tannu-ola mountains ural mountains verkhoyansk mountains yablonoi mountains lakes and rivers anabar river angara river indigirka river irtysh river kolyma river lake baikal lena river lower tunguska river novosibirsk reservoir ob river popigay river stony tunguska river upper angara river uvs nuur yana river yenisei river grasslands ukok plateau part of a unesco world heritage site geology the west siberian plain consists mostly of cenozoic alluvial deposits and is somewhat flat many deposits on this plain result from ice dams which produced a large glacial lake this mid- to late-pleistocene lake blocked the northward flow of the ob and yenisei rivers resulting in a redirection southwest into the caspian and aral seas via the turgai valley the area is very swampy and soils are mostly peaty histosols and in the treeless northern part histels in the south of the plain where permafrost is largely absent rich grasslands that are an extension of the kazakh steppe formed the original vegetation most of which is no longer visible the central siberian plateau is an ancient craton sometimes named angaraland that formed an independent continent before the permian see the siberian continent it is exceptionally rich in minerals containing large deposits of gold diamonds and ores of manganese lead zinc nickel cobalt and molybdenum much of the area includes the siberian trapsa large igneous province this massive eruptive period was approximately coincident with the permiantriassic extinction event the volcanic event is said to be the largest known volcanic eruption in earths history only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the quaternary but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost and the only tree that can thrive despite the warm summers is the deciduous siberian larch larix sibirica with its very shallow roots outside the extreme northwest the taiga is dominant covering a significant fraction of the entirety of siberia soils here are mainly turbels giving way to spodosols where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice content lower the lena-tunguska petroleum province includes the central siberian platform some authors refer to it as the eastern siberian platform bounded on the northeast and east by the late carboniferous through jurassic verkhoyansk foldbelt on the northwest by the paleozoic taymr foldbelt and on the southeast south and southwest by the middle silurian to middle devonian baykalian foldbelt a regional geologic reconnaissance study begun in 1932 followed by surface and subsurface mapping revealed the markova-angara arch anticline this led to the discovery of the markovo oil field in 1962 with the markovo1 well which produced from the early cambrian osa horizon bar-sandstone at a depth of 2156 metres 7073ft the sredne-botuobin gas field was discovered in 1970 producing from the osa and the proterozoic parfenovo horizon the yaraktin oil field was discovered in 1971 producing from the vendian yaraktin horizon at depths of up to 1750 metres 5740ft which lies below permian to lower jurassic basalt traps climate the climate of siberia varies dramatically but it typically has short summers and long brutally cold winters on the north coast north of the arctic circle there is a very short about one-month-long summer almost all the population lives in the south along the trans-siberian railway the climate in this southernmost part is humid continental climate kppen dfb with cold winters but fairly warm summers lasting at least four months the annual average is about 05c 329f january averages about 20c 4f and july about 19c 66f while daytime temperatures in summer typically are above 20c 68f with a reliable growing season an abundance of sunshine and exceedingly fertile chernozem soils southern siberia is good enough for profitable agriculture as was proven in the early 20th century by far the most commonly occurring climate in siberia is continental subarctic koppen dfc or dwc with the annual average temperature about 5c 23f and an average for january of 25c 13f and an average for july of 17c 63f although this varies considerably with a july average about 10c 50f in the taigatundra ecotone the business oriented website and blog business insider lists verkhoyansk and oymyakon in siberias sakha republic as being in competition for the title of the northern hemispheres pole of cold oymyakon is a village which recorded a temperature of 677c 899f on 6 february 1933 verkhoyansk a town further north and further inland recorded a temperature of 698c 936f for 3 consecutive nights 5 6 and 7 february 1933 each town is alternately considered the northern hemispheres pole of cold meaning the coldest inhabited point in the northern hemisphere each town also frequently reaches 86f 30c in the summer giving them and much of the rest of russian siberia the worlds greatest temperature variation between summers highs and winters lows often being well over 170180 f 94100 c between the seasons the rural locality of delyankir also in the sakha republic is another candidate for the northern pole of cold as its average temperature throughout all winter months is lower than that of either oymyakon or verkhoyansk and it also has a lower yearly average temperature its record low of 65 c 85 f is slightly higher than the record lows set at oymyakon and verkhoyansk however southwesterly winds bring warm air from central asia and the middle east the climate in west siberia omsk novosibirsk is several degrees warmer than in the east irkutsk chita where in the north an extreme winter subarctic climate kppen dfd or dwd prevails but summer temperatures in other regions can reach 38c 100f in general sakha is the coldest siberian region and the basin of the yana river has the lowest temperatures of all with permafrost reaching 1493 metres 4898ft nevertheless as far as imperial russian plans of settlement were concerned cold was never viewed as an impediment in the winter southern siberia sits near the center of the semi-permanent siberian high so winds are usually light in the winter precipitation in siberia is generally low exceeding 500 millimetres 20in only in kamchatka where moist winds flow from the sea of okhotsk onto high mountains producing the regions only major glaciers though volcanic eruptions and low summer temperatures allow limited forests to grow precipitation is high also in most of primorye in the extreme south where monsoonal influences can produce quite heavy summer rainfall researchers including sergei kirpotin at tomsk state university and judith marquand at oxford university warn that western siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming the frozen peat bogs in this region may hold billions of tons of methane gas which may be released into the atmosphere methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in 2008 a research expedition for the american geophysical union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the atmosphere above the siberian arctic likely the result of methane clathrates being released through holes in a frozen lid of seabed permafrost around the outfall of the lena river and the area between the laptev sea and east siberian sea siberian ethnic faces there are at least three different types of faces in siberian tribes ethnicities similar to the slant eyes single-eyelids by east asians many siberians have slit-eyes single-eyelids however there are other distinct looking facial phenotypes in siberia many siberians have big eyes with double-eyelids as well as big lofty nasal bridge some siberians even show dark or red skin not observable from the other half of siberians nor from east asia in siberia there are typically eskimo face y-haplogroup c turkic face y-haplogroup n slavic face y-haplogroup r as well as many faces somewhere in between due to mendels laws siberian faces depend on the mixture ratio such variety of facial phenotypes are visible even in chukchi ethnicity which is located at the farthest eastern siberia near alaska some east asian ethnicities such as northern china korea are mixed with these siberians and show similar faces many siberian ethnicities show higher percentage of y-haplogroup n than mongol only about 1 out of 10 mongolians are turkic y-haplogroup n while the rest of them are mostly eskimo y-haplogroup c

flora picea obovata pinus pumila politics borders and administrative division the term siberia has a long history its meaning has gradually changed during ages historically siberia was defined as the whole part of russia to the east of ural mountains including the russian far east according to this definition siberia extended eastward from the ural mountains to the pacific coast and southward from the arctic ocean to the border of russian central asia and the national borders of both mongolia and china soviet-era sources great soviet encyclopedia and others and modern russian ones usually define siberia as a region extending eastward from the ural mountains to the watershed between pacific and arctic drainage basins and southward from the arctic ocean to the hills of north-central kazakhstan and the national borders of both mongolia and china by this definition siberia includes the federal subjects of the siberian federal district and some of the ural federal district as well as sakha yakutia republic which is a part of the far eastern federal district geographically this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of urals and far eastern federal districts but they are not included administratively this definition excludes sverdlovsk oblast and chelyabinsk oblast both of which are included in some wider definitions of siberia other sources may use either a somewhat wider definition that states the pacific coast not the watershed is the eastern boundary thus including the whole russian far east or a somewhat narrower one that limits siberia to the siberian federal district thus excluding all subjects of other districts in russian the word for siberia is used as a substitute for the name of the federal district by those who live in the district itself and less commonly used to denote the federal district by people residing outside of it major cities the most populous city of siberia as well as the third most populous city of russia is the city of novosibirsk other major cities include barnaul irkutsk kemerovo krasnoyarsk novokuznetsk omsk tomsk tyumen wider definitions of siberia also include chelyabinsk khabarovsk vladivostok yekaterinburg some sources such as encyclopdia britannica include this city as it lies in the ural mountains inhabitants have distanced themselves though saying that there is a difference between siberian and urals culture economy siberia is extraordinarily rich in minerals containing ores of almost all economically valuable metals it has some of the worlds largest deposits of nickel gold lead coal molybdenum gypsum diamonds diopside silver and zinc as well as extensive unexploited resources of oil and natural gas around 70 of russias developed oil fields are in the khanty-mansiysk region russia contains about 40 of the worlds known resources of nickel at the norilsk deposit in siberia norilsk nickel is the worlds biggest nickel and palladium producer siberian agriculture is severely restricted by the short growing season of most of the region however in the southwest where soils are exceedingly fertile black earths and the climate is a little more moderate there is extensive cropping of wheat barley rye and potatoes along with the grazing of large numbers of sheep and cattle elsewhere food production owing to the poor fertility of the podzolic soils and the extremely short growing seasons is restricted to the herding of reindeer in the tundrawhich has been practiced by natives for over 10000 years siberia has the worlds largest forests timber remains an important source of revenue even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover the sea of okhotsk is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large tidal ranges and thus siberia produces over 10 of the worlds annual fish catch although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the ussr while the development of renewable energy in russia is held back by the lack of a conducive government policy framework siberia still offers special opportunities for off-grid renewable energy developments remote parts of siberia are too costly to connect to central electricity and gas grids and have therefore historically been supplied with costly diesel sometimes flown in by helicopter in such cases renewable energy is often cheaper sport professional football teams include fc tom tomsk fc sibir novosibirsk and fk yenisey krasnoyarsk the yenisey krasnoyarsk basketball team has played in the vtb united league since 201112 russias third most popular sport bandy is important in siberia in the 201516 russian bandy super league season yenisey from krasnoyarsk became champions for the third year in a row by beating baykal-energiya from irkutsk in the final two or three more teams depending on the definition of siberia play in the super league the 2016-17 champions ska-neftyanik from khabarovsk as well as kuzbass from kemerovo and sibselmash from novosibirsk in 2007 kemerovo got russias first indoor arena specifically built for bandy now khabarovsk has the worlds biggest indoor arena specifically built for bandy arena yerofey it was venue for division a of the 2018 world championship the 2019 winter universiade will be hosted by krasnoyarsk demographics according to the russian census of 2010 the siberian and far eastern federal districts located entirely east of the ural mountains together have a population of about 256 million tyumen and kurgan oblasts which are geographically in siberia but administratively part of the urals federal district together have a population of about 43 million thus the whole region of asian russia or siberia in the broadest usage of the term is home to approximately 30 million people it has a population density of about three people per square kilometre all siberians are russian citizens and of these russian citizens of siberia most are slavic-origin russians and russified ukrainians the remaining russian citizens of siberia consists of other groups of non-indigenous ethnic origins and those of indigenous siberian origin among the largest non-slavic group of russian citizens of siberia are the approximately 400000 ethnic volga germans russified romanians with ancestral origins from bessarabia present-day moldova also live in siberia the original indigenous groups of siberia including mongol and turkic groups such as buryats tuvinians yakuts and siberian tatars still mostly reside in siberia though they are minorities outnumbered by all other non-indigenous siberians indeed slavic-origin russians by themselves outnumber all of the indigenous peoples combined both in siberia as a whole and its cities except in the republic of tuva slavic-origin russians make up the majority in the buryat sakha and altai republics outnumbering the indigenous buryats sakha and altai the buryat make up only 25 of their own republic and the sakha and altai each are only one-third and the chukchi evenk khanti mansi and nenets are outnumbered by non-indigenous peoples by 90 of the population according to the 2002 census there are 500000 tatars in siberia but of these 300000 are volga tatars who also settled in siberia during periods of colonization and are thus also non-indigenous siberians in contrast to the 200000 siberian tatars which are indigenous to siberia of the indigenous siberians the buryats numbering approximately 500000 are the most numerous group in siberia and they are mainly concentrated in their homeland the buryat republic according to the 2002 census there were 443852 indigenous yakuts other ethnic groups indigenous to siberia include kets evenks chukchis koryaks yupiks and yukaghirs about seventy percent of siberias people live in cities mainly in apartments many people also live in rural areas in simple spacious log houses novosibirsk is the largest city in siberia with a population of about 15 million tobolsk tomsk tyumen krasnoyarsk irkutsk and omsk are the older historical centers religion there are a variety of beliefs throughout siberia including orthodox christianity other denominations of christianity tibetan buddhism and islam the siberian federal district alone has an estimation of 250000 muslims an estimated 70000 jews live in siberia some in the jewish autonomous region the predominant religious group is the russian orthodox church tradition regards siberia the archetypal home of shamanism and polytheism is popular these native sacred practices are considered by the tribes to be very ancient there are records of siberian tribal healing practices dating back to the 13th century the vast territory of siberia has many different local traditions of gods these include ak ana anapel bugady musun kara khan khaltesh-anki kinije kuurkil nga nutenut numi-torem numi-turum pon pugu todote tokoyoto tomam xaya iccita zonget places with sacred areas include olkhon an island in lake baikal transport many cities in northern siberia such as petropavlovsk-kamchatsky cannot be reached by road as there are virtually none connecting from other major cities in russia or asia the best way to tour siberia is through the trans-siberian railway the trans-siberian railway operates from moscow in the west to vladivostok in the east cities that are located far from the railway are best reached by air or by the separate baikal-amur-railway bam culture cuisine stroganina is a raw fish dish of the indigenous people of northern arctic
