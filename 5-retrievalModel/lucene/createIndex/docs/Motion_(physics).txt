in physics motion is a change in position of an object over time motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement distance velocity acceleration time and speed motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame if the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference reference point the body is said to be at rest motionless immobile stationary or to have constant time-invariant position an objects motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force as described momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring the motion of an object an objects momentum is directly related to the objects mass and velocity and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system one not affected by external forces does not change with time as described by the law of conservation of momentum as there is no absolute frame of reference absolute motion cannot be determined thus everything in the universe can be considered to be moving motion applies to objects bodies and matter particles to radiation radiation fields and radiation particles and to space its curvature and space-time one can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries so the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system for example one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions laws of motion in physics motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics motions of all large-scale and familiar objects in the universe such as projectiles planets cells and humans are described by classical mechanics whereas the motion of very small atomic and sub-atomic objects is described by quantum mechanics classical mechanics classical mechanics is used for describing the motion of macroscopic objects from projectiles to parts of machinery as well as astronomical objects such as spacecraft planets stars and galaxies it produces very accurate results within these domains and is one of the oldest and largest in science engineering and technology classical mechanics is fundamentally based on newtons laws of motion these laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body they were first compiled by sir isaac newton in his work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica first published on july 5 1687 newtons three laws are a body either is at rest or moves with constant velocity until and unless an outer force is applied to it an object will travel in one direction only until an outer force changes its direction whenever one body exerts a force f onto a second body in some cases which is standing still the second body exerts the force f on the first body f and f are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense so the body which exerts f will go backwards newtons three laws of motion were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding orbiting bodies in outer space this explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth classical mechanics was further enhanced by albert einsteins special relativity and general relativity special relativity is concerned with the motion of objects with a high velocity approaching the speed of light general relativity is employed to handle gravitational motion at a deeper level uniform motion when an object moves with a constant speed at a particular direction at regular intervals of time its known as the uniform motion for example a bike moving in a straight line with a constant speed equations of uniform motion if v final velocity u initial velocity a acceleration t time s displacement then quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is a set of principles describing physical reality at the atomic level of matter molecules and atoms and the subatomic particles electrons protons neutrons and even smaller elementary particles such as quarks these descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both matter and radiation energy as described in the waveparticle duality in classical mechanics accurate measurements and predictions of the state of objects can be calculated such as location and velocity in the quantum mechanics due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle the complete state of a subatomic particle such as its location and velocity cannot be simultaneously determined in addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large-scale phenomenon such as superfluidity superconductivity and biological systems including the function of smell receptors and the structures of proteins list of imperceptible human motions humans like all known things in the universe are in constant motion however aside from obvious movements of the various external body parts and locomotion humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to perceive many of these imperceptible motions are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation the larger scales of imperceptible motions are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons newtons laws of motion particularly the third which prevents the feeling of motion on a mass to which the observer is connected and the lack of an obvious frame of reference which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving the smaller scales of these motions are too small to be detected conventionally with human senses universe spacetime the fabric of the universe is expanding meaning everything in the universe is stretching like a rubber band this motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such but rather a change in the very nature of the universe the primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by edwin hubble who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from earth known as hubbles law predicted by a universal expansion galaxy the milky way galaxy is moving through space and many astronomers believe the velocity of this motion to be approximately 600 kilometres per second 1340000mph relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background this frame of reference indicates that the milky way is moving at around 582 kilometres per second 1300000mph sun and solar system the milky way is rotating around its dense galactic center thus the sun is moving in a circle within the galaxys gravity away from the central bulge or outer rim the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240 kilometres per second 470000 and 540000mph all planets and their moons move with the sun thus the solar system is moving earth the earth is rotating or spinning around its axis this is evidenced by day and night at the equator the earth has an eastward velocity of 04651 kilometres per second 1040mph the earth is also orbiting around the sun in an orbital revolution a complete orbit around the sun takes one year or about 365 days it averages a speed of about 30 kilometres per second 67000mph continents the theory of plate tectonics tells us that the continents are drifting on convection currents within the mantle causing them to move across the surface of the planet at the slow speed of approximately 254 centimetres 1in per year however the velocities of plates range widely the fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of 75 millimetres 30in per year and the pacific plate moving 5269 millimetres 2027in per year at the other extreme the slowest-moving plate is the eurasian plate progressing at a typical rate of about 21 millimetres 083in per year internal body the human heart is constantly contracting to move blood throughout the body through larger veins and arteries in the body blood has been found to travel at approximately 033ms though considerable variation exists and peak flows in the venae cavae have been found between 01 and 045 metres per second 033 and 148fts additionally the smooth muscles of hollow internal organs are moving the most familiar would be the occurrence of peristalsis which is where digested food is forced throughout the digestive tract though different foods travel through the body at different rates an average speed through the human small intestine is 348 kilometres per hour 216mph the human lymphatic system is also constantly causing movements of excess fluids lipids and immune system related products around the body the lymph fluid has been found to move through a lymph capillary of the skin at approximately 00000097ms cells the cells of the human body have many structures which move throughout them cytoplasmic streaming is a way which cells move molecular substances throughout the cytoplasm various motor proteins work as molecular motors within a cell and move along the surface of various cellular substrates such as microtubules and motor proteins are typically powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate atp and convert chemical energy into mechanical work vesicles propelled by motor proteins have been found to have a velocity of approximately 000000152ms particles according to the laws of thermodynamics all particles of matter are in constant random motion as long as the temperature is above absolute zero thus the molecules and atoms which make up the human body are vibrating colliding and moving this motion can be detected as temperature higher temperatures which represent greater kinetic energy in the particles feel warm to humans who sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves similarly when lower temperature objects are touched the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold subatomic particles within each atom electrons exist in an area around the nucleus this area is called the electron cloud according to bohrs model of the atom electrons have a high velocity and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move if electrons move about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light however there is no reason that one must confine ones self to this strict conceptualization that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do rather one can conceptualize electrons to be particles that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud inside the atomic nucleus the protons and neutrons are also probably moving around due to the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of angular momentum of both particles light light propagates at 299792458ms often approximated as 299792 kilometres per second 186282mis in a vacuum the speed of light or c is also the speed of all massless particles and associated fields in a vacuum and it is the upper limit on the speed at which energy matter information or causation can travel the speed of light is the limit of speed for all physical systems in addition the speed of light is an invariant quantity it has the same value irrespective of the position or speed of the observer this property makes the speed of light c a natural measurement unit for speed types of motion simple harmonic motion eg that of a pendulum linear motion motion which follows a straight linear path and whose displacement is exactly the same as its trajectory reciprocal motion eg vibration random motion eg vibration brownian motion ie the random movement of particles circular motion eg the orbits of planets rotary motion a motion about a fixed point eg ferris wheel curvilinear motion it is defined as the motion along a curved path that may be planar or in three dimensions rotational motion rolling motion as of the wheel of a bicycle oscillatory swinging from side to side vibratory motion combination or simultaneous motions combination of two or more above listed motions projectile motion uniform horizontal motion vertical accelerated motion fundamental
