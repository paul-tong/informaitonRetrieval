republic of the equator quechua ikwadur ripuwlika is a country in northwestern south america bordered by colombia on the north peru on the east and south and the pacific ocean to the west ecuador also includes the galpagos islands in the pacific about 1000 kilometres 620mi west of the mainland the capital city is quito and the largest city as well what is now ecuador was home to a variety of amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the inca empire during the 15th century the territory was colonized by spain during the 16th century achieving independence in 1820 as part of gran colombia from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 the legacy of both empires is reflected in ecuadors ethnically diverse population with most of its 164 million people being mestizos followed by large minorities of european amerindian and african descendants spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population though 13 amerindian languages are also recognized including quichua and shuar the sovereign state of ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities namely petroleum and agricultural products it is governed as a democratic presidential republic one of 17 megadiverse countries in the world ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals such as those of the galpagos islands in recognition of its unique ecological heritage the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable rights of nature or ecosystem rights history pre-inca era various peoples had settled in the area of the future ecuador before the arrival of the incas the archeological evidence suggests that the paleo-indians first dispersal into the americas occurred near the end of the last glacial period around 1650013000 years ago the first indians who reached ecuador may have journeyed by land from north and central america or by boat down the pacific ocean coastline much later migrations to ecuador may have come via the amazon tributaries others descended from northern south america and others ascended from the southern part of south america through the andes they developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups even though their languages were unrelated these groups developed similar groups of cultures each based in different environments the people of the coast developed a fishing hunting and gathering culture the people of the highland andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life and the people of the amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe with a similar language and culture many civilizations arose in ecuador such as the valdivia culture and machalilla culture on the coast the quitus near present-day quito and the caari near present-day cuenca each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture pottery and religious interests in the highland andes mountains where life was more sedentary groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed eventually through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders a group of nations formed confederations one region consolidated under a confederation called the shyris which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions its political and military power came under the rule of the duchicela blood-line inca era when the incas arrived they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the incas two generations of rulerstopa inca yupanqui and huayna capacto absorb them into the inca empire the native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of peru bolivia and north argentina similarly a number of loyal inca subjects from peru and bolivia were brought to ecuador to prevent rebellion thus the region of highland ecuador became part of the inca empire in 1463 sharing the same language in contrast when the incas made incursions into coastal ecuador and the eastern amazon jungles of ecuador they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile moreover when the incas tried to subdue them these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics as a result inca expansion into the amazon basin and the pacific coast of ecuador was hampered the indigenous people of the amazon jungle and coastal ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force the amazonian people and the cayapas of coastal ecuador were the only groups to resist inca and spanish domination maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century before the arrival of the spaniards the inca empire was involved in a civil war the untimely death of both the heir ninan cuchi and the emperor huayna capac from a european disease that spread into ecuador created a power vacuum between two factions the northern faction headed by atahualpa claims that huayna capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided he gave the territories pertaining to present-day ecuador and northern peru to his favorite son atahualpa who was to rule from quito and he gave the rest to huscar who was to rule from cuzco he willed that his heart be buried in quito his favorite city and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in cuzco huscar did not recognize his fathers will since it did not follow inca traditions of naming an inca through the priests huscar ordered atahualpa to attend their fathers burial in cuzco and pay homage to him as the new inca ruler atahualpa with a large number of his fathers veteran soldiers decided to ignore huscar and a civil war ensued a number of bloody battles took place until finally huscar was captured atahualpa marched south to cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother a small band of spaniards headed by francisco pizarro landed in tumbez and marched over the andes mountains until they reached cajamarca where the new inca atahualpa was to hold an interview with them valverde the priest tried to convince atahualpa that he should join the catholic church and declare himself a vassal of spain this infuriated atahualpa so much that he threw the bible to the ground at this point the enraged spaniards with orders from valverde attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the inca and captured atahualpa pizarro promised to release atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold but after a mock trial the spaniards executed atahualpa by strangulation spanish rule new infectious diseases endemic to the europeans caused high fatalities among the amerindian population during the first decades of spanish rule as they had no immunity at the same time the natives were forced into the encomienda labor system for the spanish in 1563 quito became the seat of a real audiencia administrative district of spain and part of the viceroyalty of peru and later the viceroyalty of new granada after nearly 300 years of spanish rule quito was still a small city numbering 10000 inhabitants on august 10 1809 the citys criollos called for independence from spain first among the peoples of latin america they were led by juan po montfar quiroga salinas and bishop cuero y caicedo quitos nickname luz de amrica light of america is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent local government although the new government lasted no more than two months it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of spanish america august 10 is now celebrated as independence day a national holiday independence on october 9 1820 guayaquil became the first city in ecuador to gain its independence from spain the people were very happy about the independence and celebrated which is now ecuadors independence day officially on may 24 1822 the rest of ecuador gained its independence after antonio jos de sucre defeated the spanish royalist forces at the battle of pichincha near quito following the battle ecuador joined simn bolvars republic of gran colombia also including modern-day colombia venezuela and panama in 1830 ecuador separated from gran colombia and became an independent republic the 19th century was marked by instability for ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers the first president of ecuador was the venezuelan-born juan jos flores who was ultimately deposed followed by several authoritarian leaders such as vicente rocafuerte jos joaqun de olmedo jos mara urbina diego noboa pedro jos de arteta manuel de ascsubi and floress own son antonio flores jijn among others the conservative gabriel garcia moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the roman catholic church in the late 19th century world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast ecuador abolished slavery and freed its black slaves in 1851 liberal revolution the liberal revolution of 1895 under eloy alfaro reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners this liberal wing retained power until the military julian revolution of 1925 the 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians such as five-time president jos mara velasco ibarra loss of claimed territories since 1830 president juan jos flores de jure territorial claims since ecuadors separation from colombia in may 13 1830 its first president general juan jos flores laid claim to the territory that was called the real audiencia of quito also referred to as the presidencia of quito he supported his claims with spanish royal decrees or real cedulas that delineated the borders of spains former overseas colonies in the case of ecuador flores-based ecuadors de jure claims on the following cedulas - real cedula of 1563 1739 and 1740 with modifications in the amazon basin and andes mountains that were introduced through the treaty of guayaquil 1829 which peru reluctantly signed after the overwhelmingly outnumbered gran colombian force led by antonio jos de sucre defeated president and general la mars peruvian invasion force in the battle of tarqui in addition ecuadors eastern border with the portuguese colony of brazil in the amazon basin was modified before the wars of independence by the first treaty of san ildefonso 1777 between the spanish empire and the portuguese empire moreover to add legitimacy to his claims on february 16 1840 flores signed a treaty with spain whereby flores convinced spain to officially recognize ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over spains former colonial territory known anciently to spain as the kingdom and presidency of quito ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors such as colombia in 1832 and 1916 brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties and peru after a short war in which the protocol of rio de janeiro was signed in 1942 struggle for independence during the struggle for independence before peru or ecuador became independent nations a few areas of the former vice royalty of new granada - guayaquil tumbez and jan - declared themselves independent from spain a few months later a part of the peruvian liberation army of san martin decided to occupy the independent cities of tumbez and jan with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the audiencia de quito ecuador it was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader san martin wished to liberate present-day ecuador and add it to the future republic of peru since it had been part of the inca empire before the spaniards conquered it however bolvars intention was to form a new republic known as the gran colombia out of the liberated spanish territory of new granada which consisted of colombia venezuela and ecuador san martins plans were thwarted when bolvar with the help of marshal antonio jos de sucre and the gran colombian liberation force descended from the andes mountains and occupied guayaquil they also annexed the newly liberated audiencia de quito to the republic of gran colombia this happened a few days before san martins peruvian forces could arrive and occupy guayaquil with the intention of annexing guayaquil to the rest of audiencia of quito ecuador and to the future republic of peru historic documents repeatedly stated that san martin told bolivar he came to guayaquil to liberate the land of the incas from spain bolivar countered by sending a message from guayaquil welcoming san martin and his troops to colombian soil peruvian occupation of jan tumbes and guayaquil in the south ecuador had de jure claims to a small piece of land beside the pacific ocean known as tumbes which lay between the zarumilla and tumbes rivers in ecuadors southern andes mountain region where the maraon cuts across ecuador had de jure claims to an area it called jan de bracamoros these areas were included as part of the territory of gran colombia by bolivar in december 17 1819 during the congress of angostura when the republic of gran colombia was created tumbes declared itself independent from spain on january 17 1821 and jaen de bracamoros on june 17 1821 without any outside help from revolutionary armies however that same year 1821 peruvian forces participating in the trujillo revolution occupied both jaen and tumbes some peruvian generals without any legal titles backing them up and with ecuador still federated with the gran colombia had the desire to annex ecuador to the republic of peru at the expense of the gran colombia feeling that ecuador was once part of the inca empire on july 28 1821 peruvian independence was proclaimed in lima by the liberator san martin and tumbes and jaen which were included as part of the revolution of trujillo by the peruvian occupying force had the whole region swear allegiance to the new peruvian flag and incorporated itself into peru even though peru was not completely liberated from spain after peru was completely liberated from spain by the patriot armies led by bolivar and antonio jose de sucre at the battle of ayacucho dated december 9 1824 there was a strong desire by some peruvians to resurrect the inca empire and to include bolivia and ecuador one of these peruvian generals was the ecuadorian-born jos de la mar who became one of perus presidents after bolivar resigned as dictator of peru and returned to colombia gran colombia had always protested peru for the return of jaen and tumbes for almost a decade then finally bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of jaen tumbes and part of mainas declared war president and general jos de la mar who was born in ecuador believing his opportunity had come to annex the district of ecuador to peru personally with a peruvian force invaded and occupied guayaquil and a few cities in the loja region of southern ecuador on november 28 1828 the war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern gran colombian army at battle of tarqui dated february 27 1829 led by antonio jos de sucre defeated the peruvian invasion force led by president la mar this defeat led to the signing of the treaty of guayaquil dated september 22 1829 whereby peru and its congress recognized gran colombian rights over tumbes jaen and maynas through protocolized meetings between representatives of peru and gran colombia the border was set as tumbes river in the west and in the east the maranon and amazon rivers were to be followed toward brazil as the most natural borders between them however what was pending was whether the new border around the jaen region should follow the chinchipe river or the huancabamba river according to the peace negotiations peru agreed to return guayaquil tumbez and jan despite this peru returned guayaquil but failed to return tumbes and jan alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements since the gran colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - ecuador colombia and venezuela the dissolution of gran colombia the central district of the gran colombia known as cundinamarca or new granada modern colombia with its capital in bogota did not recognize the separation of the southern district of the gran colombia with its capital in quito from the gran colombian federation on may 13 1830 after ecuadors separation the department of cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with ecuador due to instability in the central government of bogota president juan jos flores with the approval of the ecuadorian congress annexed the department of cauca on december 20 1830 since the government of cauca had called for union with the district of the south as far back as april 1830 moreover the cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of ecuador also the cauca region which included such cities as pasto popayn and buenaventura had always been dependent on the presidencia or audiencia of quito fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of bogot and quito where the government of bogot did not recognize the separation of ecuador or that of cauca from the gran colombia until war broke out in may 1832 in five months new granada defeated ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the ecuadorian armed forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from venezuela and colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen seeing that his officers were rebelling mutinying and changing sides president flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with new granada the treaty of pasto of 1832 was signed by which the department of cauca was turned over to new granada modern colombia the government of bogot recognized ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the ley de divisin territorial de la repblica de colombia law of the division of territory of the gran colombia passed on june 25 1824 this law set the border at the river carchi and the eastern border that stretched to brazil at the caquet river later ecuador contended that the republic of colombia while reorganizing its government unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that colombia extended its claims south to the napo river because it said that the government of popayn extended its control all the way to the napo river struggle for possession of the amazon basin when ecuador seceded from the gran colombia peru decided not to follow the treaty of guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made peru contested ecuadors claims with the newly discovered real cedula of 1802 by which peru claims the king of spain had transferred these lands from the viceroyalty of new granada to the viceroyalty of peru during colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding portuguese settlements into spanish domains which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of jesuit missionaries from their bases along the amazon basin ecuador countered by labeling the cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument which had nothing to do with political borders peru began its de facto occupation of disputed amazonian territories after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of brazil this treaty disregarded spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a spanish-portuguese treaty over the amazon regarding territories held by illegal portuguese settlers peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the mainas or maynas region which it began calling loreto with its capital in iquitos during its negotiations with brazil peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802 it claimed amazonian basin territories up to caqueta river in the north and toward the andes mountain range depriving ecuador and colombia of all their claims to the amazon basin colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the napo and amazon rivers ecuador protested that it claimed the amazon basin between the caqueta river and the maraon-amazon river peru ignored these protests and created the department of loreto in 1853 with its capital in iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both colombia and ecuador peru briefly occupied guayaquil again in 1860 since peru thought that ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to british bond holders but returned guayaquil after a few months the border dispute was then submitted to spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910 but to no avail in the early part of the 20th century ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation on may 6 1904 ecuador signed the tobar-rio branco treaty recognizing brazils claims to the amazon in recognition of ecuadors claim to be an amazonian country to counter perus earlier treaty with brazil back in october 23 1851 then after a few meetings with the colombian governments representatives an agreement was reached and the muoz vernaza-suarez treaty was signed july 15 1916 in which colombian rights to the putumayo river were recognized as well as ecuadors rights to the napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers in this way ecuador gave up the claims it had to the amazonian territories between the caquet river and napo river to colombia thus cutting itself off from brazil later a brief war erupted between colombia and peru over perus claims to the caquet region which ended with the peru reluctantly signing the salomon-lozano treaty on march 24 1922 ecuador protested this secret treaty since colombia gave away ecuadorian claimed land to peru that ecuador had given to colombia in 1916 in july 21 1924 the ponce-castro oyanguren protocol was signed between ecuador and peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the united states for arbitration negotiations between the ecuadorian and peruvian representatives began in washington on september 30 1935 these negotiations were long and tiresome both sides logically presented their cases but no one seemed to give up their claims then on february 6 1937 ecuador presented a transactional line which peru rejected the next day the negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on september 29 1937 the peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere four years later in 1941 amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the zarumilla river war broke out with peru peru claimed that ecuadors military presence in peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion ecuador for its part claimed that peru had recently invaded ecuador around the zarumilla river and that peru since ecuadors independence from spain has systematically occupied tumbez jaen and most of the disputed territories in the amazonian basin between the putomayo and maraon rivers in july 1941 troops were mobilized in both countries peru had an army of 11681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed ecuadorian force of 2300 of which only 1300 were deployed in the southern provinces hostilities erupted on july 5 1941 when peruvian forces crossed the zarumilla river at several locations testing the strength and resolve of the ecuadorian border troops finally on july 23 1941 the peruvians launched a major invasion crossing the zarumilla river in force and advancing into the ecuadorian province of el oro during the course of the ecuadorianperuvian war peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of el oro and some parts of the province of loja demanding that the ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims the peruvian navy blocked the port of guayaquil almost cutting all supplies to the ecuadorian troops after a few weeks of war and under pressure by the united states and several latin american nations all fighting came to a stop ecuador and peru came to an accord formalized in the rio protocol signed on january 29 1942 in favor of hemispheric unity against the axis powers in world war ii favouring peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end the 1944 glorious may revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed carlos arroyo del ro as a dictator from ecuadors government however a post-second world war recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s while foreign companies developed oil resources in the ecuadorian amazon in 1972 construction of the andean pipeline was completed the pipeline brought oil from the east side of the andes to the coast making ecuador south americas second largest oil exporter the pipeline in southern ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between ecuador and peru however the rio protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote cordillera del cndor region in southern ecuador this caused a long-simmering dispute between ecuador and peru which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries first a border skirmish in januaryfebruary 1981 known as the paquisha incident and ultimately full-scale warfare in january 1995 where the ecuadorian military shot down peruvian aircraft and helicopters and peruvian infantry marched into southern ecuador each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities known as the cenepa war sixto durn balln the ecuadorian president famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of ecuador popular sentiment in ecuador became strongly nationalistic against peru graffiti could be seen on the walls of quito referring to peru as the cain de latinoamrica a reference to the murder of abel by his brother cain in the book of genesis ecuador and peru signed the brasilia presidential act peace agreement on october 26 1998 which ended hostilities and effectively put an end to the western hemispheres longest running territorial dispute the guarantors of the rio protocol argentina brazil chile and the united states of america ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the cordillera del cndor while ecuador had to give up its decades-old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the cordillera as well as to the entire western area of cenepa headwaters peru was compelled to give to ecuador in perpetual lease but without sovereignty 1km 039sqmi of its territory in the area where the ecuadorian base of tiwinza focal point of the war had been located within peruvian soil and which the ecuadorian army held during the conflict the final border demarcation came into effect on may 13 1999 and the multi-national momep military observer mission for ecuador and peru troop deployment withdrew on june 17 1999 military governments 197279 in 1972 a revolutionary and nationalist military junta overthrew the government of velasco ibarra the coup dtat was led by general guillermo rodrguez and executed by navy commander jorge queirolo g the new president exiled jos mara velasco to argentina he remained in power until 1976 when he was removed by another military government that military junta was led by admiral alfredo poveda who was declared chairman of the supreme council the supreme council included two other members general guillermo durn arcentales and general luis leoro franco the civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections colonel richelieu levoyer government minister proposed and implemented a plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections this plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office return to democracy elections were held on april 29 1979 under a new constitution jaime rolds aguilera was elected president garnering over one million votes the most in ecuadorian history he took office on august 10 as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships in 1980 he founded the partido pueblo cambio y democracia people change and democracy party after withdrawing from the concentracin de fuerzas populares popular forces concentration and governed until may 24 1981 when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense marco subia martinez when his air force plane crashed in heavy rain near the peruvian border many people believe that he was assassinated by the cia given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident roldos was immediately succeeded by vice president osvaldo hurtado who was followed in 1984 by len febres cordero from the social christian party rodrigo borja cevallos of the democratic left izquierda democrtica or id party won the presidency in 1988 running in the runoff election against abdal bucaram brother in law of jaime roldos and founder of the ecuadorian roldosist party his government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms notably an opening of ecuador to foreign trade the borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group alfaro vive carajo alfaro lives dammit named after eloy alfaro however continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the id and opposition parties gained control of congress in 1999 the emergence of the amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years the population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform lower unemployment and provision of social services and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite their movement along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements has led to a deterioration of the executive office the populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital as illustrated by the most recent removal of president lucio gutirrez from office by congress in april 2005 vice president alfredo palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential election of 2006 in which rafael correa gained the presidency in december 2008 president correa declared ecuadors national debt illegitimate based on the argument that it was odious debt contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes he announced that the country would default on over 3 billion worth of bonds he then pledged to fight creditors in international courts and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60 he brought ecuador into the bolivarian alliance for the americas in june 2009 to date correas administration has succeeded in reducing the high levels of

preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory the military tradition starts in gran colombia where a sizable army was stationed in ecuador due to border disputes with peru which claimed territories under its political control when it was a spanish vice-royalty once gran colombia was dissolved after the death of simn bolvar in 1830 ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force so influential was the military in ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of general juan jose flores first president of ecuador of venezuelan origin general jose ma urbina and general robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early

of the andean range esmeraldas guayas los ros manab el oro santa elena it is the countrys most fertile and productive land and is the seat of the large banana exportation plantations of the companies dole and chiquita this region is also where most of ecuadors rice crop is grown the truly coastal provinces have active fisheries the largest coastal city is guayaquil la sierra or the highlands the sierra consists of the andean and interandean highland provinces azuay caar carchi chimborazo imbabura loja pichincha and tungurahua this land contains most of ecuadors volcanoes and all of its

known as el oriente or the east the oriente consists of the amazon jungle provinces morona santiago napo orellana pastaza sucumbos and zamora-chinchipe this region is primarily made up of the huge amazon national parks and amerindian untouchable zones which are vast stretches of land set aside for the amazon amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally it is also the area with the largest reserves of petroleum in ecuador and parts of the upper amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies the population is primarily mixed amerindian shuar huaorani and kichua although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted the largest city in the oriente is probably lago agrio in sucumbos although macas in morona santiago runs a close

20560ft above sea level ecuadors tallest mountain is the most distant point from the center of the earth on the earths surface because of the ellipsoid shape of the planet climate there is great variety in the climate largely determined by altitude it is mild year-round in the mountain valleys with a humid subtropical climate in coastal areas and rainforest in lowlands the pacific coastal area has a tropical climate with a severe rainy season the climate in the andean highlands is temperate and relatively dry and the amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones because of its location at the equator ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six oclock hours hydrology the andes is the watershed divisor between the amazon watershed which runs to the east and the pacific including the northsouth rivers mataje santiago esmeraldas chone guayas jubones and puyango-tumbes almost all of the rivers in ecuador form in the la sierra region and flow east toward the amazon river or west toward the pacific ocean the rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations in the la sierra region the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the andes to the lower elevations of the other regions the highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the costa and the oriente in the costa the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from december through may and become empty riverbeds during the dry season the few exceptions are the longer perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and la sierra on their way to the pacific ocean the internal coast by contrast is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season sometimes forming swamps major rivers in the oriente include the pastaza napo and putumayo the pastaza is formed by the confluence of the chambo and the patate rivers both of which rise in the sierra the pastaza includes the agoyan waterfall which at sixty-one meters 200 feet is the highest waterfall in ecuador the napo rises near mount cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands the napo ranges in width from 500 to 1800m 1600 to 5900ft in its upper reaches the napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries the coca river where it slows and levels off the putumayo forms part of the border with colombia all of these rivers flow into the amazon river the galpagos islands have no significant rivers several of the larger islands however have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the pacific ocean biodiversity ecuador is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world according to conservation international and it has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation ecuador has 1600 bird species 15 of the worlds known bird species in the continental area and 38 more endemic in the galpagos in addition to over 16000 species of plants the country has 106 endemic reptiles 138 endemic amphibians and 6000

first constitution to recognize the rights of nature the protection of the nations biodiversity is an explicit national priority as stated in the national plan of buen vivir or good living objective 4 guarantee the rights of nature policy 1 sustainably conserve and manage the natural heritage including its land and marine biodiversity which is considered a strategic sector as of the writing of the plan in 2008 19 of ecuadors land area was in a protected area however the plan also states that 32 of the land must be protected in order to truly preserve the nations biodiversity current protected areas include 11 national parks 10 wildlife refuges 9 ecological reserves and other areas a program begun in 2008 sociobosque is preserving another 23 of total land area 6295km or 629500 ha by paying private landowners or community landowners such as amerindian tribes incentives to maintain their land as native ecosystems such as native forests or grasslands eligibility and subsidy rates for this program are determined based on the poverty in the region the number of hectares that will be protected and the type of ecosystem of the land to be protected among other factors despite being on the unesco list the galpagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental effects threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem additionally oil exploitation of the amazon rainforest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes gas and crude oil into the environment contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to amerindian peoples economy ecuador has a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities namely petroleum and agricultural products the country is classified as an upper-middle-income country ecuadors economy is the eighth largest in latin america and experienced an average growth of 46 between 2000 and 2006 from 2007 to 2012 ecuadors gdp grew at an annual average of 43 percent above the average for latin america and the caribbean which was 35 according to the united nations economic commission for latin american and the caribbean eclac ecuador was able to maintain relatively superior growth during the crisis in january 2009 the central bank of ecuador bce put the 2010 growth forecast at 688 in 2011 its gdp grew at 8 and ranked 3rd highest in latin america behind argentina 2nd and panama 1st between 1999 and

of the total population this is explained to an extent by emigration and the economic stability achieved after adopting the us dollar as official means of transaction prior to 2000 the ecuadorian sucre was prone to rampant inflation however starting in 2008 with the bad economic performance of the nations where most ecuadorian emigrants work the reduction of poverty has been realized through social spending mainly in education and health oil accounts for 40 of exports and contributes to maintaining a positive trade balance since the late 1960s the exploitation of oil increased production and proven reserves are estimated at 651 billion barrels as of 2011 the overall trade balance for august 2012 was a surplus of almost 390 million for the first six months of 2012 a huge figure compared with that of 2007 which reached only 57 million the surplus had risen by about 425 million compared to 2006 the oil trade balance positive had revenues of 3295 million in 2008 while non-oil was negative amounting to 2842 million the trade balance with the united states chile the european union bolivia peru brazil and mexico is positive the trade balance with argentina colombia and asia

industrial production is directed primarily to the domestic market despite this there is limited export of products produced or processed industrially these include canned foods liquor jewelry furniture and more a minor industrial activity is also concentrated in cuenca the incomes due to the tourism have been increasing during the last years because of the efforts of the government of

durn balln who viewed tourism as a fundamental activity for the economic and social development of the peoples faced with the growth of the tourism sector in june 1994 the decision was taken to

given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna it has around 1640 kinds of birds the species of butterflies border the 4500 the reptiles 345 the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258 among others

means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy the country has two cities unesco world heritage sites quito and cuenca as well as two natural unesco world heritage sites the galapagos islands and sangay national park in addition to one world biosphere reserve such as the cajas massif culturally the toquilla straw hat and the culture of the zapara indigenous people are

volcanoes beaches crucita atacames baha de carquez esmeraldas manta salinas montaita transport the rehabilitation and reopening of the ecuadorian railroad and use of it as a tourist attraction is one of the recent developments in transportation matters the roads of ecuador in recent years have undergone important improvement the major routes are pan american under enhancement from four to six lanes from rumichaca to ambato the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of ambato and riobamba and running via riobamba to loja in the absence of the section between loja and the border with peru there are the route espondilus andor ruta del sol oriented to travel along the ecuadorian coastline and the amazon backbone which crosses from north to south along the ecuadorian amazon linking most and more major cities of it another major project is developing the road manta tena the highway guayaquil salinas highway aloag santo domingo riobamba macas which crosses sangay national park other new developments include the national unity bridge complex in guayaquil the bridge over the napo river in francisco de orellana the esmeraldas river bridge in the city of the same name and perhaps the most remarkable of all the bahia san vincente bridge being the largest on the latin american pacific coast the mariscal sucre international airport in quito and the jos joaqun de olmedo international airport in guayaquil have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization in the case of guayaquil it involved a new air terminal once considered the best in south america and the best in latin america and in quito where an entire new airport has been built in tababela and was inaugurated in february 2013 with canadian assistance however the main road leading from quito city centre to the new airport will only be finished in late 2014 making current travelling from the airport to downtown quito as long as two hours during rush hour quitos old city-centre airport is being turned into parkland with some light industrial use demographics ecuadors population is ethnically diverse and the 2016 estimates put ecuadors population at 16385068 the largest ethnic group as of 2010 is the mestizos who are the descendants of spanish colonists that interbred with amerindian peoples and constitute about 71 of the population the white ecuadorians white latin american account for 61 of the population of ecuador and can be found throughout all of ecuador primarily around the urban areas even though ecuadors white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from spain today ecuadors white population is a result of a mixture of european immigrants predominantly from spain with people from italy france germany and switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority these include economically well off immigrants of lebanese and palestinian descent who are either christian or muslim islam in ecuador in addition there is a small european jewish ecuadorian jews population which is based mainly in quito and to a lesser extent in guayaquil amerindians account for 7 of the current population the mostly rural montubio population of the coastal provinces of ecuador who might be classified as pardo account for 74 of the population the afro-ecuadorians is a minority population 7 in ecuador that includes the mulattos and zambos and are largely based in the esmeraldas province and to a lesser degree in the predominantly mestizo provinces of coastal ecuador - guayas and manabi in the highland andes where a predominantly mestizo white and amerindian population exist the african presence is almost non-existent except for a small community in the province of imbabura called chota valley religion according to the ecuadorian national institute of statistics and census 9195 of the countrys population have a religion 794 are atheists and 011 are agnostics among the people that have a religion 8044 are roman catholic latin rite see list of roman catholic dioceses in ecuador 1130 are evangelical protestants 129 are jehovahs witnesses and 697 other mainly jewish buddhists and latter-day saints in the rural parts of ecuador amerindian beliefs and catholicism are sometimes syncretized most festivals and annual parades are based on religious celebrations many incorporating a mixture of rites and icons there is a small number of eastern orthodox christians amerindian religions muslims see islam in ecuador buddhists and bah according to their own estimates the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints accounts for about 14 of the population or 211165 members at the end of 2012 according to their own sources in 2017 there were 92752 jehovahs witnesses in the country the first jews arrived in ecuador in the 16th and 17th centuries most of them are sephardic anusim crypto-jews and many still speak judaeo-spanish ladino language today the jewish community of ecuador comunidad juda del ecuador has its seat in quito and has approximately 200 members nevertheless this number is declining because young people leave the country for the united states or israel the community has a jewish center with a synagogue a country club and a cemetery it supports the albert einstein school where jewish history religion and hebrew classes are offered there are very small communities in cuenca the comunidad de culto israelita reunites the jews of guayaquil this community works independently from the jewish community of ecuador and is composed of only 30 people nations the ecuadorian constitution recognizes the pluri-nationality of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups thus in addition to criollos mestizos and afro-ecuadorians some people belong to the amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast quechua andean villages and the amazonian jungle population genetics according to a 2015 genealogical dna testing the average ecuadorian is estimated to be 5296 native american 4177 european and 526 sub-saharan african overall population density the majority of ecuadorians live in the central provinces the andes mountains or along the pacific coast the tropical forest region to the east of the mountains el oriente remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3 of the population birth rate is 2-1 for each death marriages are usually from 14 and above using parental consent about 124 of the population is married in the ages 1519 divorce rates are moderate population cities 2010 status according to the 2010 census immigration and emigration a small east asian latino community estimated at 2500 mainly consists of those of japanese and chinese descent whose ancestors arrived as miners farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century in the early years of world war ii ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants and in 1939 when several south american countries refused to accept 165 jewish refugees from germany aboard the ship koenigstein ecuador granted them entry permits in recent years ecuador has grown in popularity among north american expatriates theyre drawn there by the authentic cultural experience and beautiful natural surroundings also ecuadors favorable residency options make for an easy transition for those who decide to settle there indefinitely another perk that draws many expats to ecuador is its low cost of living since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in north america its a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget even real estate in ecuador is much less than its tropical counterparts however as more and more north americans are discovering ecuadors potential property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists culture ecuadors mainstream culture is defined by its hispanic mestizo majority and like their ancestry it is traditionally of spanish heritage influenced in different degrees by amerindian traditions and in some cases by african elements the first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to ecuador consisted of spanish colonists following the arrival of europeans in 1499 a lower number of other europeans and north americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and in smaller numbers poles lithuanians english irish and croats during and after the second world war since african slavery was not the workforce of the spanish colonies in the andes mountains given the subjugation of the amerindian people through proselytization and encomiendas the minority population of african descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of esmeraldas this is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of ecuador the few black african survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of anton the chief of the group where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the andean region a little later freed slaves from colombia known as cimarrones joined them in the small chota valley of the province of imbabura exists a small community of africans among the provinces predominantly mestizo population these blacks are descendants of africans who were brought over from colombia by jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves as a general rule small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in loja zaruma and zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of guayaquil today you can find a small community of africans in the catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of loja ecuadors amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees but some may also practice their own native cultures particularly the more remote amerindian communities of the amazon basin spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90 of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98 part of ecuadors population can speak amerindian languages in some cases as a second language two percent of the population speak only amerindian languages language most ecuadorians speak spanish though many speak amerindian language such as kichwa also spelt quichua which is one of the quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 25 million people in ecuador bolivia colombia and peru other amerindian languages spoken in ecuador include awapit spoken by the aw aingae spoken by the cofan shuar chicham spoken by the shuar achuar-shiwiar spoken by the achuar and the shiwiar chapalaachi spoken by the chachi tsafiki spoken by the tschila paicoca spoken by the siona and secoya and wao tededeo spoken by the waorani though most features of ecuadorian spanish are those universal to the spanish-speaking world there are several idiosyncrasies music the music of ecuador has a long history pasillo is a genre of indigenous latin music in ecuador it is the national genre of music through the years many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music there are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo pasacalle fox incaico tonada capishca bomba highly established in afro-ecuadorian societies and so on tecnocumbia and rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures one of the most traditional forms of dancing in ecuador is sanjuanito its originally from northern ecuador otavalo-imbabura sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and amerindian communities according to the ecuadorian musicologist segundo luis moreno sanjuanito was danced by amerindian people during san juan bautistas birthday this important date was established by the spaniards on june 24 coincidentally the same date when amerindian people celebrated their rituals of inti raymi cuisine ecuadorian cuisine is diverse varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions most regions in ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup a course that includes rice and a protein and then dessert and coffee to finish supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread in the highland region pork chicken beef and cuy guinea pig are popular and are served with a variety of grains especially rice and corn or potatoes in the coastal region seafood is very popular with fish shrimp and ceviche being key parts of the diet generally ceviches are served with fried plantain chifles y patacones popcorn or tostado plantain- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals encocados dishes that contain a coconut sauce are also very popular churrasco is a staple food of the coastal region especially guayaquil arroz

bananas cocoa beans to make chocolate shrimp tilapia mango and passion fruit among other products in the amazon region a dietary staple is the yuca elsewhere called cassava many fruits are available in this region including bananas tree grapes and peach palms literature early literature in colonial ecuador as in the rest of spanish america was influenced by the spanish golden age one of the earliest examples is jacinto collahuazo an amerindian chief of a northern village in todays ibarra born in the late 1600s despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the spanish collahuazo learned to read and write in castilian but his work was written in quechua the use of quipu was banned by the spanish and in order to preserve their work many inca poets had to resort to the use of the latin alphabet to write in their native quechua language the history behind the inca drama ollantay the oldest literary piece in existence for any amerindian language in america shares some similarities with the work of collahuazo collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned the existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in quito and found a hidden manuscript the salvaged fragment is a spanish translation from quechua of the elegy to the dead of atahualpa a poem written by collahuazo which describes the sadness and impotence of the inca people of having lost their king atahualpa other early ecuadorian writers include the jesuits juan bautista aguirre born in daule in 1725 and father juan de velasco born in riobamba in 1727 de velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the kingdom of quito today ecuador before the arrival of the

family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics gynecology clinical medicine and surgery community health care centers centros de salud are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas these are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours the doctors assigned to rural communities where the amerindian population can be substantial have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities the treatment in this case respects the culture of the community the public healthcare system should not be confused with the ecuadorian social security healthcare service which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers citizens with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system the ecuadorian institute of social security iess has several major hospitals and medical sub-centers under its administration across the nation ecuador currently ranks 20 in most efficient health care countries compared to 111 back in the year 2000 ecuadorians have a life expectancy of 756 years the infant mortality rate is 13 per 1000 live births a major improvement from approximately 76 in the early 1980s and 140 in 1950 23 of children under five are chronically malnourished population in some rural areas have no access to potable water and its supply is provided by mean of water tankers there are 686 malaria cases per 100000 people basic health care including doctors visits basic surgeries and basic medications has been provided free since 2008 however some public hospitals are in poor condition and often lack necessary supplies to attend the high demand of patients private hospitals and clinics are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population education the ecuadorian constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a basic level of education which is estimated at nine school years in 1996 the net primary enrollment rate was 969 and 718 of children stayed in school until the fifth grade the cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs provision of public schools falls far below the levels needed and class sizes are often very large and families of limited means often find it necessary to pay for education in rural areas only 10 of the children go on to high school the ministry of education states that the mean number of years completed is 67 ecuador has 61 universities many of which still confer terminal degrees according to the traditional spanish education system honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the americas university of san fulgencio founded in 1586 by the augustines san gregorio magno university founded in 1651 by the jesuits and university of santo toms of aquino founded in 1681 by the dominican order among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering physics chemistry or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes these terminal degrees as in the case of the phd in other countries were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher in the professional realm a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual however in 2004 the national council of higher education conesup started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts the new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects credits or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas the terminal degree in law previously known as jd juris doctor doctor en jurisprudencia was replaced by the one of abogado attorney with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree in the same fashion for medical school the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years the minimum needed to obtain the title of md in medicine and surgery to almost five with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore and it is given with the title of mdico medic therefore an md or phd in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts nonetheless a mdico can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician this new reorganization although very ambitious lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions one of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians as today a masters degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign phd to attain or retain the status of rector president of a university or dcano dean for ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country these regulations sounded illogical disappointing and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement a debate to modify this and other reforms especially the one which granted control of the higher education system by the government was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan national assembly on august 4 2010 but vetoed by president rafael correa who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and senplades national secretary of planning and development due to this change there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87 of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a masters degree and fewer than 5 have a phd although many of them already have ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees about 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training sciences and research ecuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology the most notable icons in ecuadorian sciences are the mathematician and cartographer pedro vicente maldonado born in riobamba in 1707 and the printer independence precursor and medical pioneer eugenio espejo born in 1747 in quito among other notable ecuadorian scientists and engineers are lieutenant jose rodriguez lavandera a pioneer who built the first submarine in latin america in 1837 reinaldo espinosa aguilar 18981950 a botanist and biologist of andean flora and jos aurelio dueas 18801961 a chemist and inventor of a method of textile serigraphy the major areas of scientific research in ecuador have been in the medical fields tropical and infectious diseases treatments agricultural engineering pharmaceutical research and bioengineering being a small country and a consumer of foreign technology ecuador has favored research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology the antivirus program checkprogram banking protection system mdlock and core banking software cobis are products of ecuadorian development the scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around physics statistics and partial differential equations in mathematics in the case of engineering fields the majority of scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions escuela superior politcnica del litoral - espol universidad de las fuerzas armadas - espe and escuela politcnica nacional epn the center for research and technology development in ecuador is an autonomous center for research and technology development funded by senecyt epn is known for research and education in the applied science astronomy atmospheric physics engineering and physical sciences the geophysics institute monitors over the countrys volcanoes in the andes mountains of ecuador and in the galpagos islands all of which is part of the ring of fire epn adopted the polytechnic university model that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering the oldest observatory in south america is the quito astronomical observatory and is located in quito ecuador the quito astronomical observatory which gives the global community of a virtual telescope system that is connected via the internet and allows the world to watch by streaming is managed by epn contemporary ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are eugenia del pino born 1945 the first ecuadorian to be elected to the united states national academy of science and arturo villavicencio who was part of the working group of the ipcc which shared the 2007 nobel peace prize with al gore for their dissemination of the effects of climate change currently the politics of research and investigation are managed by the national secretary of higher education science and technology
