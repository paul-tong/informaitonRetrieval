helium from greek translithelios litsun is a chemical element with symbol he and atomic number 2 it is a colorless odorless tasteless non-toxic inert monatomic gas the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements after hydrogen helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe being present at about 24 of the total elemental mass which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined its abundance is similar to this figure in the sun and in jupiter this is due to the very high nuclear binding energy per nucleon of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium this helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay most helium in the universe is helium-4 the vast majority of which was formed during the big bang large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars helium is named for the greek titan of the sun helios it was first detected as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by georges rayet captain c t haig norman r pogson and lieutenant john herschel and was subsequently confirmed by french astronomer jules janssen janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element along with norman lockyer janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868 while lockyer observed it from britain lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element which he named the formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by two swedish chemists per teodor cleve and nils abraham langlet who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite in 1903 large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the united states which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today liquid helium is used in cryogenics its largest single use absorbing about a quarter of production particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets with the main commercial application being in mri scanners heliums other industrial usesas a pressurizing and purge gas as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafersaccount for half of the gas produced a well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships as with any gas whose density differs from that of air inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice in scientific research the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 heliumi and heliumii is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics in particular the property of superfluidity and to those looking at the phenomena such as superconductivity produced in matter near absolute zero on earth it is relatively rare52 ppm by volume in the atmosphere most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements thorium and uranium although there are other examples as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei this radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7 by volume from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation previously terrestrial heliuma non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into spacewas thought to be in increasingly short supply however recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities in some cases having been released by volcanic activity history scientific discoveries the first evidence of helium was observed on august 18 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 58749 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the sun the line was detected by french astronomer jules janssen during a total solar eclipse in guntur india this line was initially assumed to be sodium on october 20 of the same year english astronomer norman lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum which he named the d3 because it was near the known d1 and d2 fraunhofer line lines of sodium he concluded that it was caused by an element in the sun unknown on earth lockyer and english chemist edward frankland named the element with the greek word for the sun helios in 1881 italian physicist luigi palmieri detected helium on earth for the first time through its d3 spectral line when he analyzed a material that had been sublimated during a recent eruption of mount vesuvius on march 26 1895 scottish chemist sir william ramsay isolated helium on earth by treating the mineral cleveite a variety of uraninite with at least 10 rare earth elements with mineral acids ramsay was looking for argon but after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the d3 line observed in the spectrum of the sun these samples were identified as helium by lockyer and british physicist william crookes it was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists per teodor cleve and abraham langlet in uppsala sweden who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight helium was also isolated by the american geochemist william francis hillebrand prior to ramsays discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite hillebrand however attributed the lines to nitrogen his letter of congratulations to ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science in 1907 ernest rutherford and thomas royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectrum of the new gas inside in 1908 helium was first liquefied by dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin he tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure onnes student willem hendrik keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure in 1913 niels bohr published his trilogy on atomic structure that included a reconsideration of the pickeringfowler series as central evidence in support of his model of the atom this series is named for edward charles pickering who in 1896 published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectrum of the star puppis these are now known to occur with wolfrayet and other hot stars pickering attributed the observation lines at 4551 5411 and 10123 to a new form of hydrogen with half-integer transition levels in 1912 alfred fowler managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen-helium mixture and supported pickerings conclusion as to their origin bohrs model does not allow for half-integer transitions nor does quantum mechanics and bohr concluded that pickering and fowler were wrong and instead assigned these spectral lines to ionised helium he fowler was initially skeptical but was ultimately convinced that bohr was correct and by 1915 spectroscopists had transferred the pickeringfowler series definitively from hydrogen to helium bohrs theoretical work on the pickering series had demonstrated the need for a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory in 1938 russian physicist pyotr leonidovich kapitsa discovered that helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero a phenomenon now called superfluidity this phenomenon is related to boseeinstein condensation in 1972 the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3 but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero by american physicists douglas d osheroff david m lee and robert c richardson the phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons in analogy to cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity extraction and use after an oil drilling operation in 1903 in dexter kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn kansas state geologist erasmus haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the university of kansas at lawrence where with the help of chemists hamilton cady and david mcfarland he discovered that the gas consisted of by volume 72 nitrogen 15 methane a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen 1 hydrogen and 12 an unidentifiable gas with further analysis cady and mcfarland discovered that 184 of the gas sample was helium this showed that despite its overall rarity on earth helium was concentrated in large quantities under the american great plains available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas this enabled the united states to become the worlds leading supplier of helium following a suggestion by sir richard threlfall the united states navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during world war i the goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable lighter-than-air gas a total of 5700m 200000cuft of 92 helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained some of this gas was used in the worlds first helium-filled airship the us navys c-7 which flew its maiden voyage from hampton roads virginia to bolling field in washington dc on december 1 1921 nearly two years before the navys first rigid helium-filled airship the naval aircraft factory-built uss shenandoah flew in september 1923 although the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during world war i production continued helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft during world war ii the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding the helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb manhattan project the government of the united states set up the national helium reserve in 1925 at amarillo texas with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime because of the helium act of 1925 which banned the export of scarce helium on which the us then had a production monopoly together with the prohibitive cost of the gas the hindenburg like all german zeppelins was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas the helium market after world war ii was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygenhydrogen rocket fuel among other uses during the space race and cold war helium use in the united states in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption after the helium acts amendments of 1960 public law 86777 the us bureau of mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas for this helium conservation program the bureau built a 425-mile 684km pipeline from bushton kansas to connect those plants with the governments partially depleted cliffside gas field near amarillo texas this helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the cliffside gas field until needed at which time it was further purified by 1995 a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was us14billion in debt prompting the congress of the united states in 1996 to phase out the reserve the resulting helium privatization act of 1996 public law 104273 directed the united states department of the interior to empty the reserve with sales starting by 2005 helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 983 pure 2 nitrogen which was adequate for airships in 1945 a small amount of 999 helium was produced for welding use by 1949 commercial quantities of grade a 9995 helium were available for many years the united states produced more than 90 of commercially usable helium in the world while extraction plants in canada poland russia and other nations produced the remainder in the mid-1990s a new plant in arzew algeria producing 17 million cubic meters 600 million cubic feet began operation with enough production to cover all of europes demand meanwhile by 2000 the consumption of helium within the us had risen to more than 15 million kg per year in 20042006 additional plants in ras laffan qatar and skikda algeria were built algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium through this time both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased from 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled as of 2012 the united states national helium reserve accounted for 30 percent of the worlds helium the reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018 despite that a proposed bill in the united states senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas other large reserves were in the hugoton in kansas united states and nearby gas fields of kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma new helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in qatar russia and the us state of wyoming but they were not expected to ease the shortage in 2013 qatar started up the worlds largest helium unit although the 2017 qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business following years of renowned shortages nasdaq reported 2015 that for air products an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints characteristics the helium atom helium in quantum mechanics in the perspective of quantum mechanics helium is the second simplest atom to model following the hydrogen atom helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and usually two neutrons as in newtonian mechanics no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach see 3-body problem and helium is no exception thus numerical mathematical methods are required even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within 2 of the correct value in a few computational steps such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other so that the effective nuclear charge z which each electron sees is about 169 units not the 2 charges of a classic bare helium nucleus the related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell the nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle high-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point exactly as does the charge density of heliums own electron cloud this symmetry reflects similar underlying physics the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in heliums nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do heliums pair of electrons although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs none of them possessing orbital angular momentum and each cancelling the others intrinsic spin adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy in fact no nucleus with five nucleons is stable this arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature for example the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the elements chemical inertness and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements in a similar way the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus produced by similar effects accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion some stable helium-3 2 protons and 1 neutron is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4 the unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the big bang as the soup of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 61 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei so tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes before they could beta-decay and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium beryllium or boron helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements see nucleogenesis and binding energy and thus once helium had been formed no energetic drive was available to make elements 3 4 and 5 it was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon carbon however due to lack of intermediate elements this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously see triple alpha process there was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the big bang before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible this left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogenhelium as is observed today 3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4 all heavier elements including those necessary for rocky planets like the earth and for carbon-based or other life have thus been created since the big bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself all elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2 of the mass of atomic matter in the universe helium-4 by contrast makes up about 23 of the universes ordinary matternearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen gas and plasma phases helium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon and thus the second least reactive of all elements it is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions because of heliums relatively low molar atomic mass its thermal conductivity specific heat and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen for these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65 that of hydrogen helium is the least water-soluble monatomic gas and one of the least water-soluble of any gas cf4 sf6 and c4f8 have lower mole fraction solubilities 03802 04394 and 02372 x210 respectively versus heliums 070797 x210 and heliums index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas helium has a negative joulethomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand only below its joulethomson inversion temperature of about 32 to 50k at 1 atmosphere does it cool upon free expansion once precooled below this temperature helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling most extraterrestrial helium is found in a plasma state with properties quite different from those of atomic helium in a plasma heliums electrons are not bound to its nucleus resulting in very high electrical conductivity even when the gas is only partially ionized the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen the particles interact with the earths magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora liquid helium unlike any other element helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures this is a direct effect of quantum mechanics specifically the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing solid helium requires a temperature of 115k about 272c or 457f at about 25 bar 25mpa of pressure it is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same the solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure but it is highly compressible applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30 with a bulk modulus of about 27 mpa it is 100 times more compressible than water solid helium has a density of 699921400000000000002140006gcm at 115k and 66atm the projected density at 0k and 25 bar 25 mpa is 699918700000000000001870009gcm at higher temperatures helium will solidify with sufficient pressure at room temperature this requires about 114000 atm helium i below its boiling point of 422 kelvins and above the lambda point of 21768 kelvins the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state called heliumi like other cryogenic liquids heliumi boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered below the lambda point however helium does not boil and it expands as the temperature is lowered further heliumi has a gas-like index of refraction of 1026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is this colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 01450125 gml between about 0 and 4 k which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium helium i and helium ii are called quantum fluids meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale this may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero preventing random molecular motion thermal energy from masking the atomic properties helium ii liquid helium below its lambda point called heliumii exhibits very unusual characteristics due to its high thermal conductivity when it boils it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface helium-3 also has a superfluid phase but only at much lower temperatures as a result less is known about the properties of the isotope heliumii is a superfluid a quantum mechanical state see macroscopic quantum phenomena of matter with strange properties for example when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 to 10m it has no measurable viscosity however when measurements were done between two moving discs a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium ii in this model liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state which behave more like an ordinary fluid in the fountain effect a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of heliumii by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass if the interior of the container is heated the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium in order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure causing liquid to fountain out of the container the thermal conductivity of heliumii is greater than that of any other known substance a million times that of heliumi and several hundred times that of copper this is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat heliumii has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well the flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air when heat is introduced it moves at 20 meters per second at 18k through heliumii as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound heliumii also exhibits a creeping effect when a surface extends past the level of heliumii the heliumii moves along the surface against the force of gravity heliumii will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates it moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material this film is called a rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait bernard v rollin as a result of this creeping behavior and heliumiis ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings it is very difficult to confine liquid helium unless the container is carefully constructed the heliumii will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer where it will evaporate waves propagating across a rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water but rather than gravity the restoring force is the van der waals force these waves are known as third sound isotopes there are nine known isotopes of helium but only helium-3 and helium-4 are stable in the earths atmosphere one atom is he for every million that are he unlike most elements heliums isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin due to the different formation processes the most common isotope helium-4 is produced on earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells it was also formed in enormous quantities during big bang nucleosynthesis helium-3 is present on earth only in trace amounts most of it has been present since earths formation though some falls to earth trapped in cosmic dust trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium rocks from the earths crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the earths mantle he is much more abundant in stars as a product of nuclear fusion thus in the interstellar medium the proportion of he to he is about 100 times higher than on earth extraplanetary material such as lunar and asteroid regolith have trace amounts of helium-3 from being bombarded by solar winds the moons surface contains helium-3 at concentrations on the order of 10 ppb much higher than the approximately 5 ppt found in the earths atmosphere a number of people starting with gerald kulcinski in 1986 have proposed to explore the moon mine lunar regolith and use the helium-3 for fusion liquid helium-4 can be cooled to about 1 kelvin using evaporative cooling in a 1-k pot similar cooling of helium-3 which has a lower boiling point can achieve about 699920000000000000002kelvin in a helium-3 refrigerator equal mixtures of liquid he and he below 699980000000000000008k separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity they follow different quantum statistics helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins it is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes which rapidly decay into other substances the shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is helium-5 with a half-life of 69787600000000000007610s helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half-life of 08 second helium-7 also emits a beta particle as well as a gamma ray helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo compounds helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions it is an electrical insulator unless ionized as with the other noble gases helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential helium can form unstable compounds known as excimers with tungsten iodine fluorine sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge to electron bombardment or reduced to plasma by other means the molecular compounds hene hghe10 and whe2 and the molecular ions he 2 he 2 heh and hed have been created this way heh is also stable in its ground state but is extremely reactiveit is the strongest brnsted acid known and therefore can exist only in isolation as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts this technique has also produced the neutral molecule he2 which has a large number of band systems and hghe which is apparently held together only by polarization forces van der waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance such as lihe and he2 theoretically other true compounds may be possible such as helium fluorohydride hhef which would be analogous to harf discovered in 2000 calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable two new molecular species predicted using theory csfheo and nch34fheo are derivatives of a metastable fheo anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from taiwan if confirmed by experiment the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon helium atoms have been inserted into the hollow carbon cage molecules the fullerenes by heating under high pressure the endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures when chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed the helium stays inside if helium-3 is used it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition like all stoichiometric chemical compounds under high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements helium-nitrogen clathrate hen211 crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca 10 gpa in a diamond anvil cell the insulating electride na2he has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 gpa it has a fluorite structure occurrence and production natural abundance although it is rare on earth helium is the second most abundant element in the known universe after hydrogen constituting 23 of its baryonic mass the vast majority of helium was formed by big bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the big bang as such measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models in stars it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the cno cycle part of stellar nucleosynthesis in the earths atmosphere the concentration of helium by volume is only 52 parts per million the concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the earths atmosphere escapes into space by several processes in the earths heterosphere a part of the upper atmosphere helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements most helium on earth is a result of radioactive decay helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium including cleveite pitchblende carnotite and monazite because they emit alpha particles helium nuclei he to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock in this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere in the earths crust the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion in seawater the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion there are also small amounts in mineral springs volcanic gas and meteoric iron because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas from which most commercial helium is extracted the concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7 in a small gas field in san juan county new mexico as of 2011 the worlds helium reserves were estimated at 40 billion cubic meters with a quarter of that being in the south pars north dome gas-condensate field owned jointly by qatar and iran in 2015 and 2016 more probable reserves were announced to be under the rocky mountains in north america and in east africa modern extraction and distribution for large-scale use helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas which can contain as much as 7 helium since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases mostly nitrogen and methane the resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture activated charcoal is used as a final purification step usually resulting in 99995 pure grade-a helium the principal impurity in grade-a helium is neon in a final production step most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process this is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers in 2008 approximately 169 million standard cubic meters scm of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately 78 from the united states 10 from algeria and most of the remainder from russia poland and qatar by 2013 increases in helium production in qatar under the company rasgas managed by air liquide had increased qatars fraction of world helium production to 25 and made it the second largest exporter after the united states an estimated 54billion cubic feet 1510m deposit of helium was found in tanzania in 2016 in the united states most helium is extracted from natural gas of the hugoton and nearby gas fields in kansas oklahoma and the panhandle field in texas much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the national helium reserve but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off and is expected to be largely depleted by 2021 under the october 2013 responsible helium administration and stewardship act hr 527 diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium in 1996 the us had proven helium reserves in such gas well complexes of about 147 billion standard cubic feet 42 billion scm at rates of use at that time 72 million scm per year in the us see pie chart below this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of us use and less than this perhaps 80 of the time at world use rates although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers helium must be extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon yet the demand for it is far higher it is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium that 01 of the worlds helium demands would be satisfied similarly only 1 of the worlds helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form as a liquid it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1000 liters of helium or in large iso containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m around 11000 us gallons in gaseous form small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m approx 282 standard cubic feet while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of as much as 4860m approx 172000 standard cubic feet conservation advocates according to helium conservationists like nobel laureate physicist robert coleman richardson writing in 2010 the free market price of helium has contributed to wasteful usage eg for helium balloons prices in the 2000s had been lowered by the decision of the us congress to sell off the countrys large helium stockpile by 2015 according to richardson the price needed to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium in their book the future of helium as a natural resource routledge 2012 nuttall clarke glowacki 2012 also proposed to create an international helium agency iha to build a sustainable market for this precious commodity applications estimated 2014 us fractional helium use by category total use is 34 million cubic meters while balloons are perhaps the best known use of helium they are a minor part of all helium use helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties such as its low boiling point low density low solubility high thermal conductivity or inertness of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg 180 million standard cubic meters helium per year the largest use about 32 of the total in 2014 is in cryogenic applications most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical mri scanners and nmr spectrometers other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems welding maintenance of controlled atmospheres and leak detection other uses by category were relatively minor fractions controlled atmospheres helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals in titanium and zirconium production and in gas chromatography because it is inert because of its inertness thermally and calorically perfect nature high speed of sound and high value of the heat capacity ratio it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities gas tungsten arc welding helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen a number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity like aluminium or copper minor uses industrial leak detection one industrial application for helium is leak detection because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment such as cryogenic tanks and high-pressure containers the tested object is placed in a chamber which is then evacuated and filled with helium the helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device helium mass spectrometer even at the leak rates as small as 10 mbarls 10 pams the measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test a simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material while helium has documented permeation constants thus a calculable permeation rate through glasses ceramics and synthetic materials inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals flight because it is lighter than air airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift while hydrogen gas is more buoyant and escapes permeating through a membrane at a lower rate helium has the advantage of being non-flammable and indeed fire-retardant another minor use is in rocketry where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel it is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles for example the saturn v rocket used in the apollo program needed about 370000m 13 million cubic feet of helium to launch minor commercial and recreational uses helium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties so helium mixtures such as trimix heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis which worsen with increasing depth as pressure increases with depth the density of the breathing gas also increases and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture this reduces the reynolds number of flow leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow which requires less work of breathing at depths below 150 metres 490ft divers breathing heliumoxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome this effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a heliumoxygen mixture heliumneon lasers a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers for its inertness and high thermal conductivity neutron transparency and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear reactors helium mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon is useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low prandtl number the inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming helium is also used in some hard disk drives scientific uses the use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes due to its extremely low index of refraction this method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography the age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics and in certain cryogenics applications as examples of applications liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for superconductivity such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging the large hadron collider at cern uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 19 kelvin as a contaminant while chemically inert helium contamination will impair the operation of microelectromechanical systems such that iphones may fail inhalation and safety effects neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood the speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air because the fundamental frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract the fundamental frequency sometimes called pitch does not change since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds which is unchanged however the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre resulting in a reedy duck-like vocal quality the opposite effect lowering resonant frequencies can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon hazards inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration fatalities have been recorded including a youth who suffocated in vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in south florida in 2006 in 1998 an australian girl her age is not known from victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous as high flow rate and pressure can result in barotrauma fatally rupturing lung tissue death caused by helium is rare the first media-recorded case was that of a 15-year-old girl from texas who died in 1998 from helium inhalation at a friends party the exact type of helium death is unidentified in the united states only two fatalities were reported between 2000 and 2004 including a man who died in north carolina of barotrauma in 2002 a youth asphyxiated in vancouver during 2003 and a 27-year-old man in australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000 since then two adults asphyxiated in south florida in 2006 and there were cases in 2009 and 2010 one a californian youth who was found with a bag over his head attached to a helium tank and another teenager in northern ireland died of asphyxiation at eagle point oregon a teenage girl died in 2012 from barotrauma at a party a girl from michigan died from hypoxia later in the year on february 4 2015 it was revealed that during the recording of their main tv show on january 28 a 12-year-old member name withheld of japanese all-girl singing group 3b junior suffered from air embolism losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game the incident was not made public until a week later the staff of tv asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures on july 13 2017 cbs news reported that a political operative who reportedly attempted to recover e-mails missing from the clinton server peter w smith apparently committed suicide in may at a hotel room in rochester minnesota and that his death was recorded as asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium more details followed in the chicago tribune the safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid nitrogen its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 k should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 k is warmed to room temperature at high pressures more than about 20atm or twompa a mixture of helium and oxygen heliox can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can
