historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence in science of multiple independent discovery robert k merton defined such multiples as instances in which similar discoveries are made by scientists working independently of each other sometimes writes merton the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which unknown to him somebody else has made years before commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of calculus by isaac newton gottfried wilhelm leibniz and others described by a rupert hall the 18th-century discovery of oxygen by carl wilhelm scheele joseph priestley antoine lavoisier and others and the theory of the evolution of species independently advanced in the 19th century by charles darwin and alfred russel wallace multiple independent discovery however is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research merton believed that it is multiple discoveries rather than unique ones that represent the common pattern in science merton contrasted a multiple with a singletona discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together a distinction is drawn between a discovery and an invention as discussed for example by bolesaw prus however since the same phenomenon of multiplicity occurs in relation to both discoveries and inventions this article lists both multiple discoveries and multiple inventions 3rd century bce aristarchos of samos c 310 c 230 bce was the first known

between the product pressure and volume within a closed system as constant when temperature remains at a fixed measure the law was named for chemist and physicist robert boyle who published the original law in 1662 the french physicist edme mariotte discovered the same law independently of boyle in 1676 newtonraphson method joseph raphson 1690 isaac newton newtons work was written in 1671

the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the sun in the proportion of five hundred to one and by supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its mass with other

electrically driven mechanical calculator with limited programability however zuses machine was never fully functional the atanasoffberry computer abc designed by john vincent atanasoff and clifford berry was the first fully electronic digital computing device while not programmable it pioneered important elements of modern computing including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements though its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable stored program distinguish it from modern computers the atom bomb was independently thought of by le szilrd jzef rotblat and others the jet

vine-matthews-morley hypothesis was independently proposed by lawrence morley and by fred vine and drummond matthews linking seafloor spreading and the symmetric zebra pattern of magnetic reversals in the basalt rocks on either side of mid-ocean ridges cosmic background radiation as a signature of the big bang was confirmed by arno penzias and robert wilson of bell labs penzias and wilson had been testing a very sensitive microwave detector when they noticed that their equipment was picking up a strange noise that was independent of the orientation direction of their instrument at first they thought the noise was generated due to pigeon droppings in the detector but even after they removed the droppings the noise was still detected meanwhile at nearby princeton university two physicists robert dicke and jim peebles were working on a suggestion of george gamows that the early universe had been hot and dense they believed its hot glow could still be detected but would be so red-shifted that it would manifest as microwaves when penzias and wilson learned about this they realized that they had already detected the red-shifted microwaves and to the disappointment of dicke and peebles were awarded the 1978 nobel prize in physics 1964 the relativistic model for the higgs mechanism was developed by three independent groups robert brout and franois englert peter higgs and gerald

document by clifford cocks a british mathematician working for the uk intelligence agency gchq but his work was not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification asymptotic freedom which states that the strong nuclear interaction between quarks decreases with decreasing distance was discovered in 1973 by david gross and frank wilczek and by david politzer and was published in the same edition of the journal physical review letters for their work the three received the nobel prize in physics in 2004 the j meson was independently discovered by a group at the stanford linear accelerator center headed by burton richter and by a group at brookhaven national laboratory headed by samuel ting of mit both announced their discoveries on november 11 1974 for their shared

emotional stresses has an important part in controlling gene expression this concept has become foundational for the field of epigenetics with its multifarious implications for physical and mental health and for sociopolitics quantum cryptographythe first cryptographic method to rely not on mathematical complexity but on the laws of physicswas first postulated in 1984 by charles bennett and gilles brassard working together and later independently in 1991 by artur ekert the earlier scheme has proven the more practical comet levy-rudenko was discovered independently by david h levy on 13

amplifiers that eventually led to emdrive was actually observed by roger shawyer in 1997 and later explained by dr mike mcculloch as well as a third researcher working for darpa in the us as this
