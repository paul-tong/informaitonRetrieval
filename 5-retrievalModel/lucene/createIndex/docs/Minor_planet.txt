a minor planet is an astronomical object in direct orbit around the sun or more broadly any star with a planetary system that is neither a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet before 2006 the international astronomical union iau officially used the term minor planet but during that years meeting it reclassified minor planets and comets into dwarf planets and small solar system bodies sssbs minor planets can be dwarf planets asteroids trojans centaurs kuiper belt objects and other trans-neptunian objects as of 2018 the orbits of 757626 minor planets were archived at the minor planet center 516386 of which had received permanent numbers for the complete list see index the first minor planet to be discovered was ceres in 1801 the term minor planet has been used since the 19th century to describe these objects the term planetoid has also been used especially for larger planetary objects such as those the international astronomical union iau has called dwarf planets since 2006 historically the terms asteroid minor planet and planetoid have been more or less synonymous this terminology has become more complicated by the discovery of numerous minor planets beyond the orbit of jupiter especially trans-neptunian objects that are generally not considered asteroids a minor planet seen releasing gas may be dually classified as a comet objects are called dwarf planets if their own gravity is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium and form an ellipsoidal shape all other minor planets and comets are called small solar system bodies the iau stated that the term minor planet may still be used but the term small solar system body will be preferred however for purposes of numbering and naming the traditional distinction between minor planet and comet is still used populations hundreds of thousands of minor planets have been discovered within the solar system and thousands more are discovered each month the minor planet center has documented over 188 million observations and 757626 minor planets of which 516386 have orbits known well enough to be assigned permanent official numbers of these 21787 have official names as of 30december2018 the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet is 3708 1974 fv1 and the highest-numbered named minor planet is 516560 annapolisroyal there are various broad minor-planet populations asteroids traditionally most have been bodies in the inner solar system near-earth asteroids those whose orbits take them inside the orbit of mars further subclassification of these based on orbital distance is used apohele asteroids orbit inside of earths perihelion distance and thus are contained entirely within the orbit of earth aten asteroids those that have semi-major axes of less than earths and aphelion furthest distance from the sun greater than 0983 au apollo asteroids are those asteroids with a semimajor axis greater than earths while having a perihelion distance of 1017 au or less like aten asteroids apollo asteroids are earth-crossers amor asteroids are those near-earth asteroids that approach the orbit of earth from beyond but do not cross it amor asteroids are further subdivided into four subgroups depending on where their semimajor axis falls between earths orbit and the asteroid belt earth trojans asteroids sharing earths orbit and gravitationally locked to it as of 2011 the only one known is 2010 tk7 mars trojans asteroids sharing marss orbit and gravitationally locked to it as of 2007 eight such asteroids are known asteroid belt whose members follow roughly circular orbits between mars and jupiter these are the original and best-known group of asteroids jupiter trojans asteroids sharing jupiters orbit and gravitationally locked to it numerically they are estimated to equal the main-belt asteroids near-earth asteroids those whose orbits take them inside the orbit of mars further subclassification of these based on orbital distance is used apohele asteroids orbit

centaurs bodies in the outer solar system between jupiter and neptune they have unstable orbits due to the gravitational influence of the giant planets and therefore must have come from elsewhere probably outside neptune neptune trojans bodies sharing neptunes orbit and gravitationally locked to it although only a handful are known there is evidence that neptune trojans are more numerous than either the asteroids in the asteroid belt or the jupiter trojans trans-neptunian objects bodies at or beyond the orbit of neptune the outermost planet the kuiper belt objects inside an apparent population drop-off approximately 55 au from the sun classical kuiper belt objects like makemake also known as cubewanos are in primordial relatively circular orbits that are not in resonance with neptune resonant kuiper belt objects plutinos bodies like pluto that are in a 23 resonance with neptune scattered disc objects like eris with aphelia outside the kuiper belt these are thought to have been scattered by neptune resonant scattered disc objects detached objects such as sedna with both aphelia and perihelia outside the kuiper belt sednoids detached objects with perihelia greater than

in the solar system need a distinct designation the naming of minor planets runs through a three-step process first a provisional designation is given upon discoverybecause the object still may turn out to be a false positive or become lost later oncalled a provisionally designated minor planet after the observation arc is accurate enough to predict its future location a minor planet is formally designated and receives a number it is then a numbered minor planet finally in the third step it may be named by its discoverers however only a small fraction of all minor planets have been named the vast majority is either numbered or has still only a provisional designation example of the naming process 1932 ha provisional designation upon discovery on 24 april 1932 1862 1932 ha formal designation receives an official number 1862 apollo named minor planet receives a name the alphanumeric code is dropped provisional designation a newly discovered minor planet is given a provisional designation for example the provisional designation 2002 at4 consists of the year of discovery 2002 and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name eg 433 eros the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number but dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text minor planets that have been given a number but not a name keep their provisional designation eg 29075 1950 da because modern discovery techniques are finding vast numbers of new asteroids they are increasingly being left unnamed the earliest discovered to be left unnamed was for a long time 3360 1981 va now 3360 syrinx as of september 2008 this distinction is held by 3708 1974 fv1 on rare occasions a small objects provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the then unnamed 15760 1992 qb1 gave its name to a group of objects that became known as classical kuiper belt objects cubewanos before it was finally named 15760 albion in january 2018 a few objects are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids such as 4015 wilsonharrington which is also listed as 107pwilsonharrington numbering minor planets are awarded an official number once their orbits are confirmed with the increasing rapidity of discovery these are now six-figure numbers the switch from five figures to six figures arrived with the publication of the minor planet circular mpc of october 19 2005 which saw the highest numbered minor planet jump from 99947 to 118161 naming the first few asteroids were named after figures from greek and roman mythology but as such names started to dwindle the names of famous people literary characters discoverers wives children and even television characters were used gender eccentric discoverers

physical properties of comets and minor planets are found in the pds asteroiddust archive this includes standard asteroid physical characteristics such as the properties of binary systems occultation timings and diameters masses densities rotation periods surface temperatures albedoes spin vectors taxonomy and absolute magnitudes and slopes in addition european asteroid research node earn an
