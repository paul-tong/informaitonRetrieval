konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovsky russian ipaknstntin dardvt tslkofskj listen polish konstantin eduardowicz ciokowski 17 septemberos 5 september1857 19 september 1935 was a russian and soviet rocket scientist and pioneer of the astronautic theory along with the french robert esnault-pelterie the german-romanian hermann oberth and the american robert h goddard he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry and astronautics his works later inspired leading soviet rocket engineers such as sergei korolev and valentin glushko and contributed to the success of the soviet space program tsiolkovsky spent most of his life in a log house on the outskirts of kaluga about 200km 120mi southwest of moscow a recluse by nature his unusual habits made him seem bizarre to his fellow townsfolk early life tsiolkovsky was born in izhevskoye now in spassky district ryazan oblast in the russian empire to a middle-class family his father edward tsiolkovsky was a polish forester of russian orthodox faith who was exiled to russia his mother was of mixed volga tatar and russian origin his father was successively a forester teacher and minor government official at the age of 10 konstantin caught scarlet fever and became hard of hearing when he was 13 his mother died he was not admitted to elementary schools because of his hearing problem so he was self-taught as a reclusive home-schooled child he passed much of his time by reading books and became interested in mathematics and physics as a teenager he began to contemplate the possibility of space travel tsiolkovsky spent three years attending a moscow library where russian cosmism proponent nikolai fyodorov worked he later came to believe that colonizing space would lead to the perfection of the human race with immortality and a carefree existence additionally inspired by the fiction of jules verne tsiolkovsky theorized many aspects of space travel and rocket propulsion he is considered the father of spaceflight and the first person to conceive the space elevator becoming inspired in 1895 by the newly constructed eiffel tower in paris despite the youths growing knowledge of physics his father was concerned that he would not be able to provide for himself financially as an adult and brought him back home at the age of 19 after learning that he was overworking himself and going hungry afterwards tsiolkovsky passed the teachers exam and went to work at a school in borovsk near moscow he also met and married his wife varvara sokolova during this time despite being stuck in kaluga a small town far from major learning centers tsiolkovsky managed to make scientific discoveries on his own the first two decades of the 20th century were marred by personal tragedy tsiolkovskys son ignaty committed suicide in 1902 and in 1908 many of his accumulated papers were lost in a flood in 1911 his daughter lyubov was arrested for engaging in revolutionary activities scientific achievements tsiolkovsky stated that he developed the theory of rocketry only as a supplement to philosophical research on the subject he wrote more than 400 works including approximately 90 published pieces on space travel and related subjects among his works are designs for rockets with steering thrusters multistage boosters space stations airlocks for exiting a spaceship into the vacuum of space and closed-cycle biological systems to provide food and oxygen for space colonies tsiolkovskys first scientific study dates back to 18801881 he wrote a paper called theory of gases in which he outlined the basis of the kinetic theory of gases but after submitting it to the russian physico-chemical society rpcs he was informed that his discoveries had already been made 25 years earlier undaunted he pressed ahead with his second work the mechanics of the animal organism it received favorable feedback and tsiolkovsky was made a member of the society tsiolkovskys main works after 1884 dealt with four major areas the scientific rationale for the all-metal balloon airship streamlined airplanes and trains hovercraft and rockets for interplanetary travel in 1892 he was transferred to a new teaching post in kaluga where he continued to experiment during this period tsiolkovsky began working on a problem that would occupy much of his time during the coming years an attempt to build an all-metal dirigible that could be expanded or shrunk in size tsiolkovsky developed the first aerodynamics laboratory in russia in his apartment in 1897 he built the first russian wind tunnel with an open test section and developed a method of experimentation using it in 1900 with a grant from the academy of sciences he made a survey using models of the simplest shapes and determined the drag coefficients of the sphere flat plates cylinders cones and other bodies tsiolkovskys work in the field of aerodynamics was a source of ideas for russian scientist nikolay zhukovsky the father of modern aerodynamics and hydrodynamics tsiolkovsky described the airflow around bodies of different geometric shapes but because the rpcs did not provide any financial support for this project he was forced to pay for it largely out of his own pocket tsiolkovsky studied the mechanics of powered flying machines which were designated dirigibles the word airship had not yet been invented tsiolkovsky first proposed the idea of an all-metal dirigible and built a model of it the first printed work on the airship was a controllable metallic balloon 1892 in which he gave the scientific and technical rationale for the design of an airship with a metal sheath progressive for his time tsiolkovsky was not supported on the airship project and the author was refused a grant to build the model an appeal to the general aviation staff of the russian army also had no success in 1892 he turned to the new and unexplored field of heavier-than-air aircraft tsiolkovskys idea was to build an airplane with a metal frame in the article an airplane or a birdlike aircraft flying machine 1894 are descriptions and drawings of a monoplane which in its appearance and aerodynamics anticipated the design of aircraft that would be constructed 15 to 18 years later in an aviation airplane the wings have a thick profile with a rounded front edge and the fuselage is faired but work on the airplane as well as on the airship did not receive recognition from the official representatives of russian science and tsiolkovskys further research had neither monetary nor moral support in 1914 he displayed his models of all-metal dirigibles at the aeronautics congress in st petersburg but met with a lukewarm response disappointed at this tsiolkovsky gave up on space and aeronautical problems with the onset of world war i and instead turned his attention to the problem of alleviating poverty this occupied his time during the war years until the russian revolution in 1917 starting in 1896 tsiolkovsky systematically studied the theory of motion of rocket apparatus thoughts on the use of the rocket principle in the cosmos were expressed by him as early as 1883 and a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion was developed in 1896 tsiolkovsky derived the formula which he called the formula of aviation establishing the relationship between change in the rockets speed v displaystyle delta v exhaust velocity of the engine v e displaystyle ve initial m0 and final m1 mass of the rocket after writing out this equation tsiolkovsky recorded the date 10 may 1897 in the same year the formula for the motion of a body of variable mass was published in the thesis of the russian mathematician i v meshchersky dynamics of a point of variable mass i v meshchersky st petersburg 1897 his most important work published in may 1903 was exploration of outer space by means of rocket devices russian tsiolkovsky calculated using the tsiolkovsky equation that the horizontal speed required for a minimal orbit around the earth is 8000ms 5 miles per second and that this could be achieved by means of a multistage rocket fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen in the article exploration of outer space by means of rocket devices it was proved for the first time that a rocket could perform space flight in this article and its subsequent sequels 1911 and 1914 he developed some ideas of missiles and considered the use of liquid rocket engines the outward appearance of tsiolkovskys spacecraft design published in 1903 was a basis for modern spaceship design the design had a hull divided into three main sections the pilot and copilot were in the first section the second and third sections held the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen needed to fuel the spacecraft however the result of the first publication was not what tsiolkovsky expected no foreign scientists appreciated his research which today is a major scientific discipline in 1911 he published the second part of the work exploration of outer space by means of rocket devices here tsiolkovsky evaluated the work needed to overcome the force of gravity determined the speed needed to propel the device into the solar system escape velocity and examined calculation of flight time the publication of this article made a splash in the scientific world tsiolkovsky found many friends among his fellow scientists in 19261929 tsiolkovsky solved the practical problem regarding the role played by rocket fuel in getting to escape velocity and leaving the earth he showed that the final speed of the rocket depends on the rate of gas flowing from it and on how the weight of the fuel relates to the weight of the empty rocket tsiolkovsky conceived a number of ideas that have been later used in rockets they include gas rudders graphite for controlling a rockets flight and changing the trajectory of its center of mass the use of components of the fuel to cool the outer shell of the spacecraft during re-entry to earth and the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle a pump system for feeding the fuel components the optimal descent trajectory of the spacecraft while returning from space etc in the field of rocket propellants tsiolkovsky studied a large number of different oxidizers and combustible fuels and recommended specific pairings liquid oxygen and hydrogen and oxygen with hydrocarbons tsiolkovsky did much fruitful work on the creation of the theory of jet aircraft and invented his chart gas turbine engine in 1927 he published the theory and design of a train on an air cushion he first proposed a bottom of the retractable body chassis however space flight and the airship were the main problems to which he devoted his life tsiolkovsky had been developing the idea of the hovercraft since 1921 publishing a fundamental paper on it in 1927 entitled air resistance and the express train russian in 1929 tsiolkovsky proposed the construction of multistage rockets in his book space rocket trains russian tsiolkovsky championed the idea of the diversity of life in the universe and was the first theorist and advocate of human spaceflight tsiolkovsky never built a rocket he apparently did not expect many of his theories to ever be implemented hearing problems did not prevent the scientist from having a good understanding of music as outlined in his work the origin of music and its essence later life although tsiolkovsky supported the bolshevik revolution he did not particularly flourish under a communist system eager to promote science and technology the new soviet government elected him a member of the socialist academy in 1918 he worked as a high school mathematics teacher until retiring in 1920 at the age of 63 in 1921 he received a lifetime pension only late in his lifetime was tsiolkovsky honored for his pioneering work in particular his support of eugenics made him politically unpopular however from the mid 1920s onwards the importance of his other work was acknowledged and he was honoured for it and the soviet state provided financial backing for his research he was initially popularized in soviet russia in 19311932 mainly by two writers iakov perelman and nikolai rynin tsiolkovsky died in kaluga on 19 september 1935 after undergoing an operation for stomach cancer he bequeathed his lifes work to the soviet state legacy although many called his ideas impractical tsiolkovsky influenced later rocket scientists throughout europe like wernher von braun russian search teams at peenemnde found a german translation of a book by tsiolkovsky of which almost every pagewas embellished by von brauns comments and notes leading soviet rocket-engine designer valentin glushko and rocket designer sergey korolev studied tsiolkovskys works as youths and both sought to turn tsiolkovskys theories into reality in particular korolev saw traveling to mars as the more important priority until in 1964 he decided to compete with the american project apollo for the moon in 1989 tsiolkovsky was inducted into the international air space hall of fame at the san diego air space museum philosophical work tsiolkovsky wrote a book called the will of the universe the unknown intelligence in 1928 in which he propounded a philosophy of panpsychism he believed humans would eventually colonize the milky way galaxy his thought preceded the space age by several decades and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death tsiolkovsky also did not believe in traditional religious cosmology but instead and to the chagrin of the soviet authorities he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans as marionettes mechanical puppets machines movie characters thereby adhering to a mechanical view of the universe which he believed would be controlled in the millennia to come through the power of human science and industry tributes in 1964 the monument to the conquerors of space was erected to celebrate the achievements of the soviet people in space exploration located in moscow the monument is 107 meters 350 feet tall and covered with titanium cladding the main part of the monument is a giant obelisk topped by a rocket and resembling in shape the exhaust plume of the rocket a statue of konstantin tsiolkovsky the precursor of astronautics is located in front of the obelisk the state museum of the history of cosmonautics in kaluga now bears his name the town uglegorsk in amur oblast was renamed tsiolkovsky by russian president vladimir putin in 2015 the crater tsiolkovskiy the most prominent crater on the far side of the moon was named after him while asteroid 1590 tsiolkovskaja was named after his wife the soviet union obtained naming rights by operating luna 3 the first space device to successfully transmit images of the side of the moon not seen from earth there is a statue of konstantin tsiolkovsky directly outside the sir thomas brisbane planetarium in brisbane queensland australia there is a
