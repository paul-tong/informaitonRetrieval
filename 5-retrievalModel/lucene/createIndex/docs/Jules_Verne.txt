jules gabriel verne vrn frenchyl vn 8 february 1828 24 march 1905 was a french novelist poet and playwright jules verne was born in the seaport of nantes he was trained to follow in his fathers footsteps as a lawyer but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage his collaboration with the publisher pierre-jules hetzel led to the creation of the voyages extraordinaires a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including journey to the center of the earth 1864 twenty thousand leagues under the sea 1870 and around the world in eighty days 1873 verne is generally considered a major literary author in france and most of europe where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism his reputation is markedly different in anglophone regions where he has often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or childrens books largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels are often reprinted verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979 ranking between agatha christie and william shakespeare he has sometimes been called the father of science fiction a title that has also been given to h g wells mary shelley and hugo gernsback life early life jules gabriel verne was born on 8 february 1828 on le feydeau a small artificial island on the loire river within the town of nantes in no 4 rue olivier-de-clisson the house of his maternal grandmother dame sophie allotte de la fue his parents were pierre verne an attorney originally from provins and sophie allote de la fue a nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners of distant scottish descent in 1829 the verne family moved some hundred meters away to no 2 quai jean-bart where vernes brother paul was born the same year three sisters anna 1836 mathilde 1839 and marie 1842 would follow in 1834 at the age of six verne was sent to boarding school at 5 place du bouffay in nantes the teacher mme sambin was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before mme sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like robinson crusoe from his desert island paradise the theme of the robinsonade would stay with verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels including the mysterious island 1874 second fatherland 1900 and the school for robinsons 1882 in 1836 verne went on to cole saintstanislas a catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father verne quickly distinguished himself in mmoire recitation from memory geography greek latin and singing in the same year 1836 pierre verne bought a vacation house at 29 rue des rforms in the village of chantenay now part of nantes on the loire river in his brief memoir souvenirs denfance et de jeunesse memories of childhood and youth 1890 verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it he also took vacations at brains in the house of his uncle prudent allotte a retired shipowner who had gone around the world and served as mayor of brains from 1828 to 1837 verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the game of the goose with his uncle and both the game and his uncles name would be memorialized in two late novels the will of an eccentric 1900 and robur the conqueror 1886 respectively legend has it that in 1839 at the age of 11 verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship coralie with the intention of traveling to the indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin caroline the evening the ship set out for the indies it stopped first at paimboeuf where pierre verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel only in his imagination it is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by vernes first biographer his niece marguerite allotte de la fye though it may have been inspired by a real incident in 1840 the vernes moved again to a large apartment at no 6 rue jean-jacques-rousseau where the familys youngest child marie was born in 1842 in the same year verne entered another religious school the petit sminaire de saint-donatien as a lay student his unfinished novel un prtre en 1839 a priest in 1839 written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive describes the seminary in disparaging terms from 1844 to 1846 verne and his brother were enrolled in the lyce royal now the lyce georges-clemenceau in nantes after finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy he took the baccalaurat at rennes and received the grade fairly good on 29 july 1846 by 1847 when verne was 19 he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of victor hugo beginning un prtre en 1839 and seeing two verse tragedies alexandre vi and la conspiration des poudres the gunpowder plot to completion however his father took it for granted that verne being the firstborn son of the family would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice in 1847 vernes father sent him to paris primarily to begin his studies in law school and secondarily according to family legend to distance him temporarily from nantes his cousin caroline with whom he was in love was married on 27 april 1847 to mile dezaunay a man of 40 with whom she would have five children after a short stay in paris where he passed first-year law exams verne returned to nantes for his fathers help in preparing for the second year provincial law students were in that era required to go to paris to take exams while in nantes he met rose herminie arnaud grossetire a young woman one year his senior and fell intensely in love with her he wrote and dedicated some 30 poems to her including la fille de lair the daughter of air which describes her as blonde and enchanting winged and transparent his passion seems to have been reciprocated at least for a short time but grossetires parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future they married her instead to armand terrien de la haye a rich landowner 10 years her senior on 19 july 1848 the sudden marriage sent verne into deep frustration he wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery this requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will grande in master zacharius 1854 sava in mathias sandorf 1885 ellen in a floating city 1871 etc to such an extent that the scholar christian chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a herminie complex the incident also led verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and nantes society which he criticized in his poem la sixime ville de france the sixth city of france studies in paris in july 1848 verne left nantes again for paris where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession he obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 rue de lancienne-comdie which he shared with douard bonamy another student of nantes origin on his 1847 paris visit verne had stayed at 2 rue thrse the house of his aunt charuel on the butte saint-roch verne arrived in paris during a time of political upheaval the french revolution of 1848 in february louis philippe i had been overthrown and had fled on 24 february a provisional government of the french second republic took power but political demonstrations continued and social tension remained in june barricades went up in paris and the government sent louis-eugne cavaignac to crush the insurrection verne entered the city shortly before the election of louis-napolon bonaparte as the first president of the republic a state of affairs that would last until the french coup of 1851 in a letter to his family verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent june days uprising but assured them that the anniversary of bastille day had gone by without any significant conflict verne used his family connections to make an entrance into paris society his uncle francisque de chataubourg introduced him into literary salons and verne particularly frequented those of mme de barrre a friend of his mothers while continuing his law studies he fed his passion for the theatre writing numerous plays verne later recalled i was greatly under the influence of victor hugo indeed very excited by reading and re-reading his works at that time i could have recited by heart whole pages of notre dame de paris but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor living on the same floor in the rue de lancienne-comdie apartment house was a young composer aristide hignard with whom verne soon became good friends and verne wrote several texts for hignard to set as chansons during this period vernes letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps the first of many he would suffer from during his life modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mothers side rumors of an outbreak of cholera in march 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns yet another health problem would strike in 1851 when verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis these attacks rather than being psychosomatic were due to an inflammation in the middle ear though this cause remained unknown to verne during his life in the same year verne was required to enlist in the french military but the sortition process spared him to his great relief he wrote to his father you should already know dear papa what i think of the military life and of these domestic servants in livery you have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions vernes strong antiwar sentiments to the dismay of his father would remain steadfast throughout his life though writing profusely and frequenting the salons verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a licence en droit in january 1851 literary debut thanks to his visits to salons verne came into contact in 1849 with alexandre dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time the chevalier darpentigny verne became close friends with dumas son alexandre dumas fils and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy les pailles rompues the broken straws the two young men revised the play together and dumas through arrangements with his father had it produced by the opra-national at the thtre historique in paris opening on 12 june 1850 in 1851 verne met with a fellow writer from nantes pierre-michel-franois chevalier known as pitre-chevalier the editor-in-chief of the magazine muse des familles the family museum pitre-chevalier was looking for articles about geography history science and technology and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story verne with his delight in diligent research especially in geography was a natural for the job verne first offered him a short historical adventure story the first ships of the mexican navy written in the style of james fenimore cooper whose novels had deeply influenced him pitre-chevalier published it in july 1851 and in the same year published a second short story a voyage in a balloonaugust 1851 the latter story with its combination of adventurous narrative travel themes and detailed historical research would later be described by verne as the first indication of the line of novel that i was destined to follow dumas fils put verne in contact with jules seveste a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the thtre-historique and renamed it the thtre lyrique seveste offered verne the job of secretary of the theatre with little or no salary attached verne accepted using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with hignard and the prolific librettist michel carr to celebrate his employment at the thtre lyrique verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors dining club the onze-sans-femme eleven bachelors for some time vernes father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer however verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature the pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in january 1852 when his father offered verne his own nantes law practice faced with this ultimatum verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job writing am i not right to follow my own instincts its because i know who i am that i realize what i can be one day meanwhile verne was spending much time at the bibliothque nationale de france conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries especially in geography it was in this period that verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer jacques arago who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness he had lost his sight completely in 1837 the two men became good friends and aragos innovative and witty accounts of his travels led verne toward a newly developing genre of literature that of travel writing in 1852 two new pieces from verne appeared in the muse des familles martin paz a novella set in lima which verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 july through 11 august 1852 and les chteaux en californie ou pierre qui roule namasse pas mousse the castles in california or a rolling stone gathers no moss a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres in april and may 1854 the magazine published vernes short story master zacharius an e t a hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition followed soon afterward by a winter amid the ice a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of vernes novels the muse also published some nonfiction popular science articles which though unsigned are generally attributed to verne vernes work for the magazine was cut short in 1856 when he had a serious quarrel with pitre-chevalier and refused to continue contributing a refusal he would maintain until 1863 when pitre-chevalier died and the magazine went to new editorship while writing stories and articles for pitre-chevalier verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel a roman de la science novel of science which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the bibliothque he is said to have discussed the project with the elder alexandre dumas who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel isaac laquedem and who enthusiastically encouraged vernes project at the end of 1854 another outbreak of cholera led to the death of jules seveste vernes employer at the thtre lyrique and by then a good friend though his contract only held him to a further year of service verne remained connected to the theatre for several years after sevestes death seeing additional productions to fruition he also continued to write plays and musical comedies most of which were not performed family in may 1856 verne traveled to amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a nantes friend auguste lelarge to an amiens woman named aime du fraysse de viane verne invited to stay with the brides family took to them warmly befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the brides sister honorine de viane morel a widow aged 26 with two young children hoping to find a secure source of income as well as a chance to court morel in earnest he jumped at her brothers offer to go into business with a brokerage vernes father was initially dubious but gave in to his sons requests for approval in november 1856 with his financial situation finally looking promising verne won the favor of morel and her family and the couple were married on 10 january 1857 verne plunged into his new business obligations leaving his work at the thtre lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an agent de change on the paris bourse where he became the associate of the broker fernand eggly verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write before going to the bourse for the days work in the rest of his spare time he continued to consort with the onze-sans-femme club all eleven of its bachelors had by this time gotten married he also continued to frequent the bibliothque to do scientific and historical research much of which he copied onto notecards for future usea system he would continue for the rest of his life according to the recollections of a colleague verne did better in repartee than in business in july 1858 verne and aristide hignard seized an opportunity offered by hignards brother a sea voyage at no charge from bordeaux to liverpool and scotland the journey vernes first trip outside france deeply impressed him and upon his return to paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel backwards to britain written in the autumn and winter of 18591860 and not published until 1989 a second complementary voyage in 1861 took hignard and verne to stockholm from where they traveled to christiania and through telemark verne left hignard in denmark to return in haste to paris but missed the birth on 3 august 1861 of his only biological son michel meanwhile verne continued work on the idea of a roman de la science which he developed in a rough draft inspired according to his recollections by his love for maps and the great explorers of the world it took shape as a story of travel across africa and would eventually become his first published novel five weeks in a balloon hetzel in 1862 through their mutual acquaintance alfred de brhat verne came into contact with the publisher pierre-jules hetzel and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel then called voyage en ballon hetzel already the publisher of balzac george sand victor hugo and other well-known authors had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education he saw verne with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories as an ideal contributor for such a magazine and accepted the novel giving verne suggestions for improvement verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to hetzel with the final draft now titled five weeks in a balloon it was published by hetzel on 31 january 1863 to secure his services for the planned magazine to be called the magasin dducation et de rcration magazine of education and recreation hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which verne would give him three volumes of text per year each of which hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee verne finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last accepted immediately for the rest of his lifetime most of his novels would be serialized in hetzels magasin before their appearance in book form beginning with his second novel for hetzel the adventures of captain hatteras 186465 when the adventures of captain hatteras was published in book form in 1866 hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for vernes novels by saying in a preface that vernes works would form a novel sequence called the voyages extraordinaires extraordinary voyages or extraordinary journeys and that vernes aim was to outline all the geographical geological physical and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own the history of the universe late in life verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels my object has been to depict the earth and not the earth alone but the universe and i have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style it is said that there cant be any style in a novel of adventure but it isnt true however he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious yes but the earth is very large and life is very short in order to leave a completed work behind one would need to live to be at least 100 years old hetzel influenced many of vernes novels directly especially in the first few years of their collaboration for verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes hetzel suggested for example when hetzel disapproved of the original climax of captain hatteras including the death of the title character verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which hatteras survived hetzel also rejected vernes next submission paris in the twentieth century believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine the manuscript believed lost for some time after vernes death was finally published in 1994 the relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869 when verne and hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for twenty thousand leagues under the sea verne had initially conceived of the submariner captain nemo as a polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the russians who had killed his family during the january uprising hetzel not wanting to alienate the lucrative russian market for vernes books demanded that nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero verne after fighting vehemently against the change finally invented a compromise in which nemos past is left mysterious after this disagreement verne became notably cooler in his dealings with hetzel taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright from that point verne published two or more volumes a year the most successful of these are voyage au centre de la terre journey to the center of the earth 1864 de la terre la lune from the earth to the moon 1865 vingt mille lieues sous les mers twenty thousand leagues under the sea 1869 and le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours around the world in eighty days which first appeared in le temps in 1872 verne could now live on his writings but most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours 1874 and michel strogoff 1876 which he wrote with adolphe dennery in 1867 verne bought a small ship the saint-michel which he successively replaced with the saint-michel ii and the saint-michel iii as his financial situation improved on board the saint-michel iii he sailed around europe after his first novel most of his stories were first serialised in the magazine dducation et de rcration a hetzel biweekly publication before being published in book form his brother paul contributed to 40th french climbing of the mont-blanc and a collection of short stories doctor ox in 1874 verne became wealthy and famous meanwhile michel verne married an actress against his fathers wishes had two children by an underage mistress and buried himself in debts the relationship between father and son improved as michel grew older later years though he was raised catholic verne became a deist in his later years from about 1870 onward some scholars believe his deist philosophy is reflected in his novels as they often involve the notion of god or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of christ on 9 march 1886 as verne was coming home his twenty-six-year-old nephew gaston shot at him twice with a pistol the first bullet missed but the second one entered vernes left leg giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome this incident was hushed up in the media but gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum after the death of both his mother and hetzel jules verne began publishing darker works in 1888 verne entered politics and was elected town councilor of amiens where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years verne was made a chevalier de la lgion dhonneur in 1870 he was promoted to an officier de la lgion dhonneur in 1892 death and posthumous publications on 24 march 1905 while ill with diabetes verne died at his home in amiens 44 boulevard longueville now boulevard jules-verne his son michel verne oversaw publication of the novels invasion of the sea and the lighthouse at the end of the world after juless death the voyages extraordinaires series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year it was later discovered that michel verne had made extensive changes in these stories and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the jules verne society socit jules verne in 1919 michel verne published the barsac mission french ltonnante aventure de la mission barsac which original drafts contained references to esperanto language about which his father had great interest in 1989 vernes great-grandson discovered his ancestors as yet unpublished novel paris in the twentieth century which was subsequently published in 1994 works vernes largest body of work is the voyages extraordinaires series which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts paris in the twentieth century and backwards to britain published posthumously in 1994 and 1989 respectively and for projects left unfinished at his death many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son michel verne also wrote many plays poems song texts operetta libretti and short stories as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction literary reception after his debut under hetzel verne was enthusiastically received in france by writers and scientists alike with george sand and thophile gautier among his earliest admirers several notable contemporary figures from the geographer vivien de saint-martin to the critic jules claretie spoke highly of verne and his works in critical and biographical notes however vernes growing popularity among readers and playgoers due especially to the highly successful stage version of around the world in eighty days led to a gradual change in his literary reputation as the novels and stage productions continued to sell many contemporary critics felt that vernes status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller rather than a serious author worthy of academic study this denial of formal literary status took various forms including dismissive criticism by such writers as mile zola and the lack of nomination to verne for membership in the acadmie franaise and was recognized by verne himself who said in a late interview the great regret of my life is that i have never taken any place in french literature to verne who considered himself a man of letters and an artist living in the pursuit of the ideal this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub this bifurcation of verne as a popular genre writer but a critical persona non grata continued after his death with early biographies including one by vernes own niece marguerite allotte de la fue focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of verne as a popular figure rather than on vernes actual working methods or his output meanwhile sales of vernes novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in vernes home country with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place however the decades after vernes death also saw the rise in france of the jules verne cult a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took vernes works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works some of the cult founded the socit jules verne the first academic society for verne scholars many others became highly respected avant garde and surrealist literary figures in their own right their praise and analyses emphasizing vernes stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes proved highly influential for literary studies to come in the 1960s and 1970s thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known french scholars and writers vernes reputation skyrocketed in france roland barthes seminal essay nautilus et bateau ivre the nautilus and the drunken boat was influential in its exegesis of the voyages extraordinares as a purely literary text while book-length studies by such figures as marcel mor and jean chesneaux considered verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points french literary journals devoted entire issues to verne and his work with essays by such imposing literary figures as michel butor georges borgeaud marcel brion pierre versins michel foucault ren barjavel marcel lecomte francis lacassin and michel serres meanwhile vernes entire published opus returned to print with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by livre de poche and ditions rencontre the wave reached its climax in vernes sesquicentennial year 1978 when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the centre culturel international de cerisy-la-salle and journey to the center of the earth was accepted for the french university systems agrgation reading list since these events verne has been consistently recognized in europe as a legitimate member of the french literary canon with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing vernes reputation in english-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing throughout the 20th century most anglophone scholars dismissed verne as a genre writer for children and a nave proponent of science and technology despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts thus finding him more interesting as a technological prophet or as a subject of comparison to english-language writers such as edgar allan poe and h g wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right this narrow view of verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality english translations and very loosely adapted hollywood film versions through which most american and british readers have discovered verne however since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious english-language studies and translations have appeared suggesting that a rehabilitation of vernes anglophone reputation may currently be underway english translations translation of verne into english began in 1852 when vernes short story a voyage in a balloon 1851 was published in the american journal sartains union magazine of literature and art in a translation by anne t wilbur translation of his novels began in 1869 with william lacklands translation of five weeks in a balloon originally published in 1863 and continued steadily throughout vernes lifetime with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into english-language print unlike hetzel who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the voyages extraordinaires the british and american publishers of verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences this business move with its implication that verne could be treated purely as a childrens author had a long-lasting effect on vernes reputation in english-speaking countries these early english-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions errors and alterations and are not considered adequate representations of vernes actual novels the british writer adam roberts in an essay for the guardian titled jules verne deserves a better translation service commented id always liked reading jules verne and ive read most of his novels but it wasnt until recently that i really understood i hadnt been reading jules verne at all its a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in indeed i cant think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation similarly the american novelist michael crichton observed vernes prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way but verne has been particularly ill-served by his english translators at best they have provided us with clunky choppy tone-deaf prose at worstas in the notorious 1872 translation of journey to the center of the earth published by griffith farranthey have blithely altered the text giving vernes characters new names and adding whole pages of their own invention thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of vernes original since 1965 a considerable number of more accurate english translations of verne have appeared however the highly criticized older translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status and in many cases their easy availability in online sources relationship with science fiction the relationship between vernes voyages extraordinaires and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one verne like h g wells is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre and his profound influence on its development is indisputable however many earlier writers such as lucian of samosata voltaire and mary shelley have also been cited as creators of science fiction an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre a primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether vernes works count as science fiction to begin with maurice renard claimed that verne never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific saying i have invented nothing his own goal was rather to depict the earth and at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style as he pointed out in an example i wrote five weeks in a balloon not as a story about ballooning but as a story about africa i always was greatly interested in geography and travel and i wanted to give a romantic description of africa now there was no means of taking my travellers through africa otherwise than in a balloon and that is why a balloon is introduced i may say that at the time i wrote the novel as now i had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons closely related to vernes science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a prophet of scientific progress and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace these claims have a long history especially in america but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated in a 1961 article critical of twenty thousand leagues under the seas scientific accuracy theodore l thomas speculated that vernes storytelling skill and readers misremembering a book they read as children caused people to remember things from it that are not there the impression that the novel contains valid scientific prediction seems to grow as the years roll by as with science fiction verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was mere coincidence and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research even before i began writing stories i always took numerous notes out of every book newspaper magazine or scientific report that i came across legacy vernes novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works writers known to have been influenced by verne include marcel aym roland barthes ren barjavel michel butor blaise cendrars paul claudel jean cocteau franois mauriac raymond roussel claude roy julio cortzar antoine saint-exupry and jean-paul sartre while scientists and explorers who acknowledged vernes inspiration have included richard e byrd yuri gagarin simon lake hubert lyautey guglielmo marconi fridtjof nansen konstantin tsiolkovsky wernher von braun and jack parsons he is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology ray bradbury summed up vernes influence on literature and science the world over by saying we are all in one way or another the children of jules verne notes footnotes citations media from wikimedia
