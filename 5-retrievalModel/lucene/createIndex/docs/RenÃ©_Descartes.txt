ren descartes dekrt uk also dekrt frenchne dekat latinized renatus cartesius adjectival form cartesian 31 march 1596 11 february 1650 was a french philosopher mathematician and scientist a native of the kingdom of france he spent about 20 years 162949 of his life in the dutch republic after serving for a while in the dutch states army of maurice of nassau prince of orange and the stadtholder of the united provinces he is generally considered one of the most notable intellectual figures of the dutch golden age descartes meditations on first philosophy 1641 continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments descartes influence in mathematics is equally apparent the cartesian coordinate system see below was named after him he is credited as the father of analytical geometry the bridge between algebra and geometry used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis descartes was also one of the key figures in the scientific revolution descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers he frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors in the opening section of the passions of the soul an early modern treatise on emotions descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic as if no one had written on these matters before his best known philosophical statement is i think therefore i am french je pense donc je suis latin ego cogito ergo sum found in discourse on the method 1637 written in french and latin and principles of philosophy 1644 written in latin many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late aristotelianism the revived stoicism of the 16th century or in earlier philosophers like augustine in his natural philosophy he differed from the schools on two major points first he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form second he rejected any appeal to final ends divine or natural in explaining natural phenomena in his theology he insists on the absolute freedom of gods act of creation descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism later advocated by spinoza and leibniz and opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of hobbes locke berkeley and hume leibniz spinoza and descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy and descartes and leibniz contributed greatly to science as well life early life ren descartes was born in la haye en touraine now descartes indre-et-loire france on 31 march 1596 his mother jeanne brochard died soon after giving birth to him and so he was not expected to survive descartes father joachim was a member of the parlement of brittany at rennes ren lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle although the descartes family was roman catholic the poitou region was controlled by the protestant huguenots in 1607 late because of his fragile health he entered the jesuit collge royal henry-le-grand at la flche where he was introduced to mathematics and physics including galileos work after graduation in 1614 he studied for two years 161516 at the university of poitiers earning a baccalaurat and licence in canon and civil law in 1616 in accordance with his fathers wishes that he should become a lawyer from there he moved to paris in discourse on the method descartes recalls i entirely abandoned the study of letters resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world i spent the rest of my youth traveling visiting courts and armies mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it given his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618 descartes joined as a mercenary the protestant dutch states army in breda under the command of maurice of nassau and undertook a formal study of military engineering as established by simon stevin descartes therefore received much encouragement in breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics in this way he became acquainted with isaac beeckman the principal of a dordrecht school for whom he wrote the compendium of music written 1618 published 1650 together they worked on free fall catenary conic section and fluid statics both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics while in the service of the catholic duke maximilian of bavaria since 1619 descartes was present at the battle of the white mountain outside prague in november 1620 visions according to adrien baillet on the night of 1011 november 1619 st martins day while stationed in neuburg an der donau descartes shut himself in a room with an oven probably a kachelofen or masonry heater to escape the cold while within he had three dreams and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy however it is likely that what descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome upon exiting he had formulated analytical geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy he concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be for him the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his lifes work descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon his famous i think therefore i am france in 1620 descartes left the army he visited basilica della santa casa in loreto then visited various countries before returning to france and during the next few years spent time in paris it was there that he composed his first essay on method regulae ad directionem ingenii rules for the direction of the mind he arrived in la haye in 1623 selling all of his property to invest in bonds which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life descartes was present at the siege of la rochelle by cardinal richelieu in 1627 in the fall of the same year in the residence of the papal nuncio guidi di bagno where he came with mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist nicolas de villiers sieur de chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy cardinal brulle urged him to write an exposition of his own new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the inquisition netherlands descartes returned to the dutch republic in 1628 in april 1629 he joined the university of franeker studying under adriaan metius living either with a catholic family or renting the sjaerdemaslot where he invited in vain a french cook and an optician the next year under the name poitevin he enrolled at the leiden university to study mathematics with jacobus golius who confronted him with pappuss hexagon theorem and astronomy with martin hortensius in october 1630 he had a falling-out with beeckman whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas in amsterdam he had a relationship with a servant girl helena jans van der strom with whom he had a daughter francine who was born in 1635 in deventer she died of scarlet fever at the age of 5 unlike many moralists of the time descartes was not devoid of passions but rather defended them he wept upon francines death in 1640 descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man russell shorto postulated that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in descartes work changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers despite frequent moves he wrote all his major work during his 20-plus years in the netherlands where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy in 1633 galileo was condemned by the italian inquisition and descartes abandoned plans to publish treatise on the world his work of the previous four years nevertheless in 1637 he published part of this work in three essays les mtores the meteors la dioptrique dioptrics and la gomtrie geometry preceded by an introduction his famous discours de la mthode discourse on the method in it descartes lays out four rules of thought meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation the first was never to accept anything for true which i did not clearly know to be such that is to say carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt in la gomtrie descartes exploited the discoveries he made with pierre de fermat having been able to do so because his paper introduction to loci was published posthumously in 1679 this later became known as cartesian geometry descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life in 1641 he published a metaphysics work meditationes de prima philosophia meditations on first philosophy written in latin and thus addressed to the learned it was followed in 1644 by principia philosophi principles of philosophy a kind of synthesis of the discourse on the method and meditations on first philosophy in 1643 cartesian philosophy was condemned at the university of utrecht and descartes was obliged to flee to the hague and settled in egmond-binnen descartes began through alfonso polloti an italian general in dutch service a long correspondence with princess elisabeth of bohemia devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects connected with this correspondence in 1649 he published les passions de lme passions of the soul that he dedicated to the princess in 1647 he was awarded a pension by king louis xiv of france though it was never paid a french translation of principia philosophi prepared by abbot claude picot was published in 1647 this edition descartes also dedicated to princess elisabeth in the preface to the french edition descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom he identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth better and more secure consisting in the search for first causes sweden by 1649 descartes had become famous throughout europe for being one of the continents greatest philosophers and scientists that year queen christina of sweden invited descartes to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love she was interested in and stimulated descartes to publish the passions of the soul a work based on his correspondence with princess elisabeth descartes accepted and moved to sweden in the middle of winter he was a guest at the house of pierre chanut living on vsterlnggatan less than 500 meters from tre kronor in stockholm there chanut and descartes made observations with a torricellian barometer a tube with mercury challenging blaise pascal descartes took the first set of barometric readings in stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather death descartes apparently started giving lessons to queen christina after her birthday three times a week at 5 am in her cold and draughty castle soon it became clear they did not like each other she did not like his mechanical philosophy nor did he appreciate her interest in ancient greek by 15 january 1650 descartes had seen christina only four or five times on 1 february he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 february the cause of death was pneumonia according to chanut but peripneumonia according to the doctor van wullen who was not allowed to bleed him the winter seems to have been mild except for the second half of january which was harsh as described by descartes himself however this remark was probably intended to be as much descartes take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather in 1996 e pies a german scholar published a book questioning this account based on a letter by johann van wullen who had been sent by christina to treat him something descartes refused and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since descartes might have been assassinated as he asked for an emetic wine mixed with tobacco as a catholic in a protestant nation he was interred in a graveyard used mainly for orphans in adolf fredriks kyrka in stockholm his manuscripts came into the possession of claude clerselier chanuts brother-in-law and a devout catholic who has begun the process of turning descartes into a saint by cutting adding and publishing his letters selectively in 1663 the pope placed his works on the index of prohibited books in 1666 his remains were taken to france and buried in the saint-tienne-du-mont in 1671 louis xiv prohibited all the lectures in cartesianism although the national convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the panthon he was reburied in the abbey of saint-germain-des-prs in 1819 missing a finger and the skull his skull is on display in the muse de lhomme in paris philosophical work initially descartes arrives at only a single first principle i think thought cannot be separated from me therefore i exist discourse on the method and principles of philosophy most famously this is known as cogito ergo sum english i think therefore i am therefore descartes concluded if he doubted then something or someone must be doing the doubting therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence the simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence that is in and of itself proof that he does exist these two first principlesi think and i existwere later confirmed by descartess clear and distinct perception delineated in his third meditation that i clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles descartes reasoned ensures their indubitability descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks but in what form he perceives his body through the use of the senses however these have previously been unreliable so descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a thinking thing thinking is what he does and his power must come from his essence descartes defines thought cogitatio as what happens in me such that i am immediately conscious of it insofar as i am conscious of it thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious he gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams and that ones mind cannot have been hijacked by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before ones senses and so something that i thought i was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind in this manner descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge discarding perception as unreliable and instead admitting only deduction as a method dualism descartes influenced by the automatons on display throughout the city of paris began to investigate the connection between the mind and body and how the two interact his main influences for dualism were theology and physics the theory on the dualism of mind and body is descartes signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced known as cartesian dualism or mind-body dualism his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent western philosophies in meditations on first philosophy descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of god and the distinction between the human soul and the body humans are a union of mind and body thus descartes dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined while many contemporary readers of descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp he thought it was entirely straightforward descartes employed the concept of modes which are the ways in which substances exist in principles of philosophy descartes explained we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it whereas we cannot conversely understand the mode apart from the substance to perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction which descartes explained as follows the intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention thus when i consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is i make a mental abstraction according to descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other thus descartes reasoned that god is distinct from humans and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another he argued that the great differences between body an extended thing and mind an un-extended immaterial thing make the two ontologically distinct but that the mind was utterly indivisible because when i consider the mind or myself in so far as i am merely a thinking thing i am unable to distinguish any part within myself i understand myself to be something quite single and complete in meditations descartes discussed a piece of wax and exposed the single most characteristic doctrine of cartesian dualism that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substancesthe mind or soul defined as thinking and the body defined as matter and unthinking the aristotelian philosophy of descartes days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or theological everything that happened be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose goal or end that worked its way out within nature aristotle called this the final cause and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated with his theory on dualism descartes fired the opening shot for the battle between the traditional aristotelian science and the new science of kepler and galileo which denied the final cause for explaining nature descartes dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter and he expelled the final cause from the physical universe or res extensa for descartes the only place left for the final cause was the mind or res cogitans therefore while cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul descartes dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings a human was according to descartes a composite entity of mind and body descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body but the body could not exist without the mind in meditations descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance the body is composed only of accidents but he did argue that mind and body are closely joined nature also teaches me by the sensations of pain hunger thirst and so on that i am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship but that i am very closely joined and as it were intermingled with it so that i and the body form a unit if this were not so i who am nothing but a thinking thing would not feel pain when the body was hurt but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken descartes discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy what exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person therefore cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mindbody problem for many years after descartes death descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of god it was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher john locke 16321704 to combat the theory of empiricism which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience descartes on physiology and psychology in the passions of the soul written between 1645 and 1646 descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits these animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles and served as a metaphor for feelings like being in high or bad spirit these animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul or passions of the soul descartes distinguished six basic passions wonder love hatred desire joy and sadness all of these passions he argued represented different combinations of the original spirit and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions he argued for example that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body in line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland through animal spirits thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits he argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on gods will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them but he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland thus humans had to learn how to control their passions descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century reflex theory he argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation he challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous descartes writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind in the 20th century alan turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by descartes his theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories more than 200 years after his death the physiologist ivan pavlov was a great admirer of descartes descartes moral philosophy for descartes ethics was a science the highest and most perfect of them like the rest of the sciences ethics had its roots in metaphysics in this way he argues for the existence of god investigates the place of man in nature formulates the theory of mind-body dualism and defends free will however as he was a convinced rationalist descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions nevertheless the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good choices and it also depends on mental condition for this reason he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body he discussed this subject in the correspondence with princess elisabeth of bohemia and as a result wrote his work the passions of the soul that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man with an emphasis on emotions or passions his works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers see cartesianism and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be specifically how it should invoke emotion humans should seek the sovereign good that descartes following zeno identifies with virtue as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure for epicurus the sovereign good was pleasure and descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with zenos teaching because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure regarding aristotles opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside ones own control whereas ones mind is under ones complete control the moral writings of descartes came at the last part of his life but earlier in his discourse on the method he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt this is known as his provisional morals descartes on religious beliefs in the third and fifth meditation he offers an ontological proof of a benevolent god through both the ontological argument and trademark argument because god is benevolent he can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him for god has provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him from this supposition however he finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception regarding epistemology therefore he can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge he nevertheless was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories in his meditations on first philosophy descartes sets forth two proofs for gods existence one of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite and suggests that of all the ideas that are in me the idea that i have of god is the most true the most clear and distinct descartes considered himself to be a devout catholic and one of the purposes of the meditations was to defend the catholic faith his attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time however pascal regarded descartes views as rationalist and mechanist and accused him of deism i cannot forgive descartes in all his philosophy descartes did his best to dispense with god but descartes could not avoid prodding god to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers after that he had no more use for god while a powerful contemporary martin schoock accused him of atheist beliefs though descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his meditations the catholic church prohibited his books in 1663 descartes also wrote a response to external world scepticism through this method of scepticism he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information in other words certainty he argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily and are not willed by him they are external to his senses and according to descartes this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind and thus an external world descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that god would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted and that god has given him the propensity to believe that such ideas are caused by material things descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist descartes further explains how only god can be a true substance but minds are substances meaning they need only god for it to function the mind is a thinking substance the means for a thinking substance stem from ideas descartes and natural science descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences for him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge and expressed it in this way thus all philosophy is like a tree of which metaphysics is the root physics the trunk and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk which are reduced to three principals namely medicine mechanics and ethics by the science of morals i understand the highest and most perfect which presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences is the last degree of wisdom in his discourse on the method he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt to achieve this he employs a method called hyperbolicalmetaphysical doubt also sometimes referred to as methodological scepticism he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge descartes built his ideas from scratch he relates this to architecture the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings to descartes aristotles foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism descartes on animals descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence he argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions but these could be explained mechanistically whereas humans had a soul or mind and were able to feel pain and anxiety animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety if animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent although descartes views were not universally accepted they became prominent in europe and north america allowing humans to treat animals with impunity the view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century the publications of charles darwin would eventually erode the cartesian view of animals darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer historical impact emancipation from church doctrine descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern western philosophy the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of western philosophy and set the basis for modernity the first two of his meditations on first philosophy those that formulate the famous methodic doubt represent the portion of descartes writings that most influenced modern thinking it has been argued that descartes himself didnt realize the extent of this revolutionary move in shifting the debate from what is true to of what can i be certain descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from god to humanity even though descartes himself claimed he received his visions from godwhile the traditional concept of truth implies an external authority certainty instead relies on the judgment of the individual in an anthropocentric revolution the human being is now raised to the level of a subject an agent an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason this was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity the repercussions of which are still being felt the emancipation of humanity from christian revelational truth and church doctrine humanity making its own law and taking its own stand in modernity the guarantor of truth is not god anymore but human beings each of whom is a self-conscious shaper and guarantor of their own reality in that way each person is turned into a reasoning adult a subject and agent as opposed to a child obedient to god this change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the christian medieval period to the modern period a shift that had been anticipated in other fields and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by descartes this anthropocentric perspective of descartes work establishing human reason as autonomous provided the basis for the enlightenments emancipation from god and the church according to martin heidegger the perspective of descartes work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology descartes philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism mathematical legacy one of descartes most enduring legacies was his development of cartesian or analytic geometry which uses algebra to describe geometry he invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x y and z and knowns by a b and c he also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents for example the 2 used in x to indicate x squared he was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning particularly about abstract unknown quantities european mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics serving as the foundation of algebra algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as pacioli cardan tartaglia and ferrari equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal because a three-dimensional form such as a cube occupied the largest dimension of reality descartes professed that the abstract quantity a could represent length as well as an area this was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as vieta who argued that it could represent only area although descartes did not pursue the subject he preceded gottfried wilhelm leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or universal mathematics as a precursor to symbolic logic that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically and mechanize general reasoning descartes work provided the basis for the calculus developed by newton and leibniz who applied infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics his rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial the beginning to descartes interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician isaac beeckman who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy with this foundation of reasoning descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometrical physics descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical momentum a measure of the motion of an object and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line as opposed to perfect circular motion as galileo had envisioned it he outlined his views on the universe in his principles of philosophy descartes also made contributions to the field of optics he showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction also known as descartes law or more commonly snells law that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees ie the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbows centre is 42 he also independently discovered the law of reflection and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law influence on newtons mathematics current opinion is that descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young newton and this is arguably one of descartes most important contributions newton continued descartes work on cubic equations which will free the subject from fetters of the greek perspectives the most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables contemporary reception although descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life the teaching of his works in schools was controversial henri de roy henricus regius 15981679 professor of medicine at the university of utrecht was condemned by the rector of the university gijsbert voet voetius for teaching descartes physics legacy cartesian circle cartesian coordinate system cartesian diagram cartesian diver cartesian morphism cartesian plane cartesian product cartesian product of
