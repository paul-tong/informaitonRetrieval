in the context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earths moon on 4 october 1957 the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 since then about 8100 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2018 estimate some 4900 remain in orbit of those about 1900 were operational while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit at 20000km and the rest are in geostationary orbit at 36000km a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids a comet and the sun satellites are used for many purposes among several other applications they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces and also take pictures of planets they are launched into common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit a launch vehicle is a rocket that places a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbit satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control history early conceptions newtons cannonball presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon the idea surfaced again in jules vernes the begums fortune 1879 in 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky 18571935 published exploring space using jet propulsion devices in russian which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this in 1928 herman potonik 18921929 published his sole book the problem of space travel the rocket motor german das problem der befahrung des weltraums der raketen-motor he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments in a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke 19172008 described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services artificial satellites the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1s success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war sputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika in may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air forces project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle written by rr carhart this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by hk kallmann and ww kellogg in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year 195758 the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the us intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957 following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the armys which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civiliannavy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958 in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites early satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous geo satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972 currently the largest artificial satellite ever is the international space station space surveillance network the united states space surveillance network ssn a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earths orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8000-man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earths atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites ie 560 satellites the rest are space debris the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles non-military satellite services there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services fixed satellite services fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earths surface mobile satellite systems mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world andor other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems scientific research satellites commercial and noncommercial scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data eg remote sensing amateur ham radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research types astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation communication satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits molniya orbits or low earth orbits earth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc see especially earth observing system navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time killer satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assets crewed spacecraft spaceships are large satellites able to put humans into and beyond an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations miniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes new classifications are used to categorize these satellites minisatellite 500100kg microsatellite below 100kg nanosatellite below 10kg reconnaissance satellites are earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earth space-based solar power satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on earth or other places space stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space a space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit for periods of weeks months or even years tether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether weather satellites are primarily used to monitor earths weather and climate orbit types the first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1886 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit leo medium earth orbit meo and high earth orbit heo low earth orbit is any orbit below 2000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2000 and 35786km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35786km centric classifications geocentric orbit an orbit around the planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites currently there are approximately 1886 artificial satellites orbiting the earth heliocentric orbit an orbit around the sun in our solar system all planets comets and asteroids are in such orbits as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet areocentric orbit an orbit around the planet mars such as by moons or artificial satellites the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links altitude classifications low earth orbit leo geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180km 2000km 1200mi medium earth orbit meo geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2000km

transfer orbit an orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit usually the orbit of a planet to another using two engine impulses the perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the sun as the radius of one planets orbit and the aphelion is at the other the two rocket burns change the spacecrafts path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit and later to the other circular orbit this maneuver was named after walter hohmann hohmann transfer orbit an orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit usually the orbit of a planet to another using two engine impulses the perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the sun as the radius of one planets orbit and the aphelion is at the other the two rocket burns

designated areas of the planet specifically russia and the united states tundra orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 634 and orbital period of one sidereal day roughly 24 hours such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet synchronous classifications synchronous orbit an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period earths is 23 hours 56 minutes 4091 seconds of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma

a synonym for exo-orbit suborbital spaceflight a synonym for exo-orbit lunar transfer orbit lto prograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of less than 90 or rather an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary retrograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of more than 90 or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude halo orbit and lissajous orbit orbits around lagrangian points satellite subsystems the satellites functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy spacecraft bus or service module the bus module consists of the following subsystems structural subsystem the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage telemetry subsystem the telemetry subsystem aka command and data handling cdh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustments power subsystem the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earths shadow nuclear power sources radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program 19641978 thermal control subsystem the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body eg optical solar reflector attitude and orbit control subsystem the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators reaction wheels thrusters these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions communication payload the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations antennas amplifying received radio signals sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through inputoutput signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations antennas end of life when satellites reach the end of their mission this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of march2015 as well as the upper stage of its launch rocket instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78km with a range between 72 and 84km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95km launch-capable countries this list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list does not include the european space agency a multi-national state organization nor private consortiums attempted first launches the united states tried in 1957 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1958 japan tried four times in 19661969 to launch a satellite with its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970 china tried in 1969 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970 india after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1975 tried in 1979 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before succeeding in 1980 iraq have claimed an orbital launch of a warhead in 1989 but this claim was later disproved brazil after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985 tried to launch a satellite using its own vls 1 launcher three times in 1997 1999 and 2003 but all attempts were unsuccessful north korea claimed a launch of kwangmyngsng-1 and kwangmyngsng-2 satellites in 1998 and 2009 but us russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit if that was the goal the united states japan and south korea believe this was actually a ballistic missile test which was a claim also made after north koreas 1998 satellite launch and later rejected the first april 2012 launch of kwangmyngsng-3 was unsuccessful a fact publicly recognized by the dprk however the december 2012 launch of the second version of kwangmyngsng-3 was successful putting the dprks first confirmed satellite into orbit south korea korea aerospace research institute after launching their first national satellite by foreign launcher in 1992 unsuccessfully tried to launch its own launcher the kslv naro-1 created with the assistance of russia in 2009 and 2010 until success was achieved in 2013 by naro-3 the first european multi-national state organization eldo tried to make the orbital launches at europa i and europa ii rockets in 19681970 and 1971 but stopped operation after failures other notes russia and the ukraine were parts of the soviet union and thus inherited their launch capability without the need to develop it indigenously through the soviet union they are also on the number one position in this list of accomplishments france the united kingdom and ukraine launched their first satellites by own launchers from foreign spaceports some countries such as south africa spain italy germany canada australia argentina egypt and private companies such as otrag have developed their own launchers but have not had a successful launch only twelve countries from the list below ussr usa france japan china uk india russia ukraine israel iran and north korea and one regional organization the european space agency esa have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles several other countries including brazil argentina pakistan romania taiwan indonesia australia malaysia turkey and switzerland are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities launch capable private entities private firm orbital sciences corporation with launches since 1982 continues very successful launches of its minotaur pegasus taurus and antares rocket programs on 28 september 2008 late comer and private aerospace firm spacex successfully launched its falcon 1 rocket into orbit this marked the first time that a privately built liquid-fueled booster was able to reach orbit the rocket carried a prism shaped 15m 5ft long payload mass simulator that was set into orbit the dummy satellite known as ratsat will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere a few other private companies are capable of sub-orbital launches first satellites of countries while canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space it was launched aboard an american rocket from an american spaceport the same goes for australia who launched first satellite involved a donated us redstone rocket and american support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the united kingdom the first italian satellite san marco 1 launched on 15 december 1964 on a us scout rocket from wallops island virginia united states with an italian launch team trained by nasa by similar occasions almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets attempted first satellites united states tried unsuccessfully to launch its first satellite in 1957 they were successful in 1958 china tried unsuccessfully to launch its first satellite in 1969 they were successful in 1970 iraq under saddam hussein fulfilled in 1989 an unconfirmed launch of warhead on orbit by developed iraqi vehicle that intended to put later the 75kg first national satellite al-tair also developed chile tried unsuccessfully in 1995 to launch its first satellite fasat-alfa by foreign rocket in 1998 they were successful north korea has tried in 1998 2009 2012 to launch satellites first successful launch on 12 december 2012 libya since 1996 developed its own national libsat satellite project with the goal of providing telecommunication and remote sensing services that was postponed after the fall of gaddafi belarus tried unsuccessfully in 2006 to launch its first satellite belka by foreign rocket -note both chile and belarus used russian companies as principal contractors to build their satellites they used russian-ukrainian manufactured rockets and launched either from russia or kazakhstan planned first satellites afghanistan announced in april 2012 that it is planning to launch its first communications satellite to the orbital slot it has been awarded the satellite afghansat 1 was expected to be obtained by a eutelsat commercial company in 2014 armenia in 2012 founded armcosmos

launch in 2002 first remote sensing satellite later in 2004 was stated that two satellites remote sensing and telecommunication will be built by russia for 6070million each attacks on satellites in recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008 jamming due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitters range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellites transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively earth observation using satellites during the last five decades space agencies have sent thousands of space crafts space capsules or satellites to the universe in fact weathermen make forecasts on the weather and natural calamities based on observations from these satellites the national aeronautics and space administration nasa requested the national academies to publish a report entitled earth observations from space the first 50 years of scientific achievements in 2008 it described how the capability to view the whole globe simultaneously from satellite observations revolutionized studies about the planet earth this development brought about a new age of combined earth sciences the national academies report concluded that continuing earth observations from the galaxy are necessary to resolve scientific and social challenges in the future nasa the nasa introduced an earth observing system eos composed of several satellites science component and data system described as the earth observing system data and information system eosdis it disseminates numerous science data products as well as services designed for interdisciplinary education eosdis data can be accessed online and accessed through file transfer protocol ftp and hyper text transfer protocol secure https scientists and researchers perform eosdis science operations within a distributed platform of multiple interconnected nodes or science investigator-led processing systems sips and discipline-specific distributed active archive centers daccs esa the european space agency has plans to launch a satellite for earth observation this will be equipped with an artificial intelligence ai processor that will allow the spacecraft to make decisions on images to capture and data to transmit to the earth brainsat will use the intel myriad x vision processing unit vpu the launching will be scheduled in 2019 esa director for earth observation programs josef aschbaher made the announcement during the phiweek in november 2018 this is the five-day meet that focused on the future of earth observation the conference was held at the esa center for earth observation in frascati italy esa also launched the philab referring to the future-focused team that works to harness the potentials of ai and other disruptive innovations meanwhile the esa also announced that it expects to commence the qualification flight of the space rider space plane in 2021 this will come after several demonstration missions space rider is the sequel of the agencys intermediate experimental vehicle ixv which was launched in 2015 it has the capacity payload of 800 kilograms for orbital missions that will last a maximum of two months spacex spacex was scheduled to launch a multiple satellite mission on november 28 2018 from the united states vandenberg air force base after an initial november 19 schedule the launch is expected to be visible once the rocket heads toward the south into an earth observation trajectory traveling over the opposites however the second supposed launched was delayed again because of poor weather conditions and set for another date which is not yet definite the mission is known as the sso-a smallsat express is another landmark for elon musk founder of spacex which had 19 rocket launches in 2018 alone the estimated cost of this falcon 9 rocket is approximately 62million the rocket has 64
