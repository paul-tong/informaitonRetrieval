vasco nez de balboa spanish pronunciationbasko nue e aloa c 1475 around january 1221 1519 was a spanish explorer governor and conquistador he is best known for having crossed the isthmus of panama to the pacific ocean in 1513 becoming the first european to lead an expedition to have seen or reached the pacific from the new world he traveled to the new world in 1500 and after some exploration settled on the island of hispaniola he founded the settlement of santa mara la antigua del darin in present-day panama in 1510 which was the first permanent european settlement on the mainland of the americas a settlement by alonso de ojeda the previous year at san sebastin de urab had already been abandoned early life balboa was born in jerez de los caballeros spain he was a descendant of the lord mason of the castle of balboa on the borders of len and galicia his mother was the lady de badajoz and his father was the hidalgo nobleman nuo arias de balboa little is known of vascos early childhood except that he was the third of four boys in his family during his adolescence he served as a page and squire to don pedro de portocarrero lord of moguer early career in 1500 motivated by his master after the news of christopher columbuss voyages to the new world became known he decided to embark on his first voyage to the americas along with juan de la cosa on rodrigo de bastidas expedition bastidas had a license to bring back treasure for the king and queen while keeping four-fifths for himself under a policy known as the quinto real or royal fifth in 1501 he crossed the caribbean coasts from the east of panama along the colombian coast through the gulf of urab toward cabo de la vela the expedition continued to explore the north east of south america until they realized they did not have enough men and sailed to hispaniola with his share of the earnings from this campaign balboa settled in hispaniola in 1505 where he resided for several years as a planter and pig farmer he was not successful in this enterprise however and ended up in debt finally he was forced to abandon life on the island in 1508 the king of spain ferdinand ii the catholic launched the conquest of tierra firme the area roughly corresponding to the isthmus of panama he created two new territories in the region between el cabo de la vela near the eastern border of colombia and el cabo de gracias a dios the border between honduras and nicaragua the gulf of urab became the border between the two territories nueva andaluca to the east governed by alonso de ojeda and veragua to the west governed by diego de nicuesa in 1509 wishing to escape his creditors in santo domingo balboa set sail as a stowaway hiding inside a barrel together with his dog leoncico in the expedition commanded by the alcalde mayor of nueva andaluca martn fernndez de enciso whose mission it was to aid alonso de ojeda his superior ojeda together with seventy men had founded the settlement of san sebastin de urab in nueva andaluca on the location where the city of cartagena de indias would later be built however the settlers encountered resistance from natives living in the area who used poisoned weapons and ojeda was injured in the leg a short time later ojeda sailed for hispaniola leaving the colony under the supervision of francisco pizarro who at that time was only a soldier waiting for encisos expedition to arrive ojeda asked pizarro to leave some men in the settlement for fifty days and if no help arrived at the end of that time to use all possible means to get back to hispaniola before the expedition arrived at san sebastin de urab fernndez de enciso discovered balboa aboard the ship and threatened to leave him at the first uninhabited island they encountered he later thought better of this and decided that balboas knowledge of that region which he had explored eight years before would be of great utility this in addition to the crews pleas for his life left fernndez de enciso with no choice but to spare balboa and keep him aboard moreover both agreed on removing nicuesa as governor of veragua after the fifty days had passed pizarro started preparations for the return to hispaniola when encisos ship arrived balboa had gained popularity among the crew because of his charisma and his knowledge of the region by contrast fernndez de enciso was not well liked by the men many disapproved of his order to return to san sebastin especially after discovering once they had arrived that the settlement had been completely destroyed and that the natives were already waiting for them leading to a series of relentless attacks the founding of santa mara balboa suggested that the settlement of san sebastin be moved to the region of darin to the west of the gulf of urab where the soil was more fertile and the natives presented less resistance fernndez de enciso gave serious consideration to this suggestion and the regiment later went to darin where the native cacique chieftain cmaco had 500 warriors waiting ready for battle the spanish fearful of the large number of enemy combatants made a vow to the virgen de la antigua venerated in seville that they would name a settlement in the region after her should they prevail it was a difficult battle for both sides but by a stroke of luck the spanish came out victorious cmaco together with his warriors abandoned the town and headed for the jungle the spanish plundered the houses and gathered a treasure-trove of golden ornaments balboa kept his vow and in september 1510 founded the first permanent settlement on mainland american soil and called it santa mara la antigua del darin mayor of santa mara the victory of the spanish over the natives and the founding of santa mara la antigua del darin now located in a relatively calm region earned balboa authority and respect among his companions they were increasingly hostile toward alcalde mayor fernndez de enciso whom they considered a greedy despot because of the restrictions he imposed on their appropriation of the natives gold balboa took advantage of the situation acting as the spokesman for the disgruntled settlers he removed fernndez de enciso from the position of alcalde mayor using the following legal manoeuvre fernndez de enciso was now controlling an area in veragua to the west of the gulf of urab since he was substituting for alonso de ojeda his mandate was illegitimate because the governor of veragua was diego de nicuesa not ojeda therefore fernndez de enciso should be deposed and arrested after fernndez de encisos ouster a more open government was established and a municipal council was elected the first in the americas two alcaldes were appointed martn samudio and vasco nez de balboa shortly after this a flotilla led by rodrigo enrique de colmenares arrived in santa mara his objective was to find nicuesa who was also facing some difficulties in the north of panam when de colmenares learned about the recent events he convinced the towns settlers that they should submit to the authority of nicuesa since their land was under his jurisdiction enrique de colmenares invited two representatives to be named by the local government to travel with his flotilla and offer nicuesa authority over the city the two representatives were diego de albites and diego del corral governor of veragua enrique de colmenares found nicuesa near the town of nombre de dios badly wounded and with few men remaining on account of a skirmish with local natives after his rescue governor nicuesa heard about balboas exploits the chieftain cmacos bounty and santa maras prosperity he vowed that he would punish balboa as soon as he gained control of the city since he regarded his actions as a challenge to his authority in veragua a certain lope de olano who was jailed together with other malcontents persuaded santa maras representatives that they would make a serious error in handing control over to nicuesa whom he described as cruel greedy and able to singlehandedly destroy the citys prosperity with this evidence albites and del corral fled to darin ahead of nicuesa and informed balboa and the municipal authorities of the governors intentions when nicuesa arrived at the citys port a mob appeared and the ensuing disturbance prevented the governor from disembarking into the city nicuesa insisted on being received no longer as governor but as a simple soldier but still the colonists did not allow him to disembark he and 17 others were forced to board an unseaworthy boat with few supplies and were put out to sea on march 1 1511 the ship disappeared leaving no trace of nicuesa and his men in this way balboa became governor gobernador of veragua conquistador with the title of governor came absolute authority in santa mara and all of veragua one of balboas first acts as governor was the trial of fernndez de enciso accused of usurping the governors authority fernndez de enciso was sentenced to prison and his possessions were confiscated however he was to remain imprisoned only for a short time balboa set him free under the condition that he return immediately to hispaniola and from there to spain with him on the same ship were two representatives from balboa who were to inform the colonial authorities of the situation and request more men and supplies to continue the conquest of veragua balboa continued defeating various tribes and befriending others exploring rivers mountains and sickly swamps while always searching for gold and slaves and enlarging his territory he was also able to quell revolts among those of his men who challenged this authority and through force diplomacy and negotiation he earned a certain respect and fear among the natives in a letter addressed to the king of spain he expressed somewhat ironically that he had to act as a conciliatory force during the course of his expeditions he succeeded in planting corn received fresh supplies from hispaniola and spain and got his men used to life as explorers in the new territories balboa managed to collect a great deal of gold much of it from the ornaments worn by the native women and the rest obtained by violence peter martyr danghiera in his de orbe novo decades wrote how balboa had fed forty local homosexual men to his dogs balboa upset with a brother of the king and other young men obliging men who dressed effeminately with womens clothing of those which the brother of the king went too far with unnatural temerity threw forty of them as food to the dogs danghiera continues his story saying that the indigenous peoples natural hate for unnatural sin drove them so that spontaneously and violently they searched for all the rest that they would know who were infected after all danghiera mentions that only the nobles and the gentlemen practiced that kind of desire the indigenous people knew that sodomy gravely offended god and that these acts provoked the tempests that with thunder and lightning so frequently afflicted them or the floods that drowned their fruits that had caused hunger and sickness at the end of 1512 and the first months of 1513 he arrived in a region dominated by the cacique careta whom he easily defeated and then befriended careta was baptized and became one of balboas chief allies he ensured the survival of the settlers by promising to supply the spaniards with food balboa then proceeded on his journey arriving in the lands of caretas neighbour and rival cacique ponca who fled to the mountains with his people leaving his village open to the plundering of the spaniards and caretas men days later the expedition arrived in the lands of cacique comagre fertile but reportedly dangerous terrain however balboa was received peacefully and even invited to a feast in his honor comagre like careta was then baptized in 1513 balboa wrote a lengthy letter to the king of spain requesting more men who were already acclimatized from hispaniola weapons supplies carpenters versed in shipbuilding and all the necessary materials for the building of a shipyard in a subsequent letter from 1515 he would refer to his humanitarian policies regarding the natives while at the same time recommending extreme severity in dealing with cannibals and violent tribes it was in comagres lands that balboa first heard of the other sea it started with a squabble among the spaniards unsatisfied by the meager amounts of gold they were being allotted comagres eldest son panquiaco angered by the spaniards avarice knocked over the scales used to measure gold and exclaimed if you are so hungry for gold that you leave your lands to cause strife in those of others i shall show you a province where you can quell this hunger panquiaco told them of a kingdom to the south where people were so rich that they ate and drank from plates and goblets made of gold but that the conquerors would need at least a thousand men to defeat the tribes living inland and those on the coast of the other sea european discovery of the pacific ocean balboa received the unexpected news of a new kingdom rich in gold with great interest he returned to santa mara at the beginning of 1513 to recruit more men from hispaniola there he learned that fernndez de enciso had told the colonial authorities what had happened at santa mara after seeing that there would be no assistance from hispaniola balboa sent enrique de colmenares directly to spain to look for help while the expedition to the south sea the name at the time of the pacific ocean was being organized in santa mara some explorers travelled ten leagues around 50km or 30 miles up the atrato river toward the interior but came back empty-handed balboas request for men and supplies had been denied encisos case was by then widely known in the spanish court therefore balboa had no choice but to carry out his expedition with the few resources that he had on hand in santa mara using information given by various friendly caciques balboa started his journey across the isthmus of panama on september 1 1513 together with 190 spaniards a few native guides and a pack of dogs using a small brigantine and ten native canoes they sailed along the coast and made landfall in cacique caretas territory on september 6 the expedition continued now reinforced with 1000 of caretas men and entered cacique poncas land ponca had reorganized and attacked but he was defeated and forced to ally himself with balboa after a few days and with several of poncas men the expedition entered the dense jungle on september 20 and with some difficulty arrived four days later in the lands of cacique torecha who ruled in the village of cuarecu in this village a fierce battle took place during which balboas forces defeated torecha who was killed by one of balboas dogs torechas followers decided to join the expedition however the group was by then exhausted and several men were badly wounded so many decided to stay in cuarecu to regain their strength the few men who continued the journey with balboa entered the mountain range along the chucunaque river the next day according to information from the natives one could see the south sea from the summit of this range balboa went ahead and before noon that day september 25 he reached the summit and saw far away in the horizon the waters of the undiscovered sea the emotions were such that the others eagerly joined in to show their joy at balboas discovery andrs de vera the expeditions chaplain intoned the te deum while the men erected stone pyramids and engraved crosses on the barks of trees with their swords to mark the place where the discovery of the south sea was made possession and conquest of the south sea after the moment of discovery the expedition descended from the mountain range towards the sea arriving in the lands of cacique chiapes who was defeated after a brief battle and invited to join the expedition from chiapes land three groups departed in the search for routes to the coast the group headed by alonso martn reached the shoreline two days later they took a canoe for a short reconnaissance trip thus becoming the first europeans to navigate the pacific ocean off the coast of new world back in chiapes domain martn informed balboa who with 26 men marched towards the coast once there balboa raised his hands his sword in one and a standard with the image of the virgin mary in the other walked knee-deep into the ocean and claimed possession of the new sea and all adjoining lands in the name of the spanish sovereigns after traveling more than 110km 68mi balboa named the bay where they ended up san miguel because they arrived on september 29 the feast day of the archangel michael he named the new sea mar del sur since they had traveled south to reach it balboas main purpose in the expedition was the search for the gold-rich kingdoms promised by panquiaco to this end he crossed through the lands of caciques coquera and tumaco defeating them easily and taking their riches of gold and pearls he then learned that pearls were abundant in the islands ruled by terarequ a powerful and feared cacique balboa set out in several canoes towards these islands even though it was the beginning of october and the weather conditions were not favorable he was barely able to make out the islands and named the largest one isla rica rich island today known as isla del rey he named the entire group archipilago de las perlas which they are still called today in november balboa decided to return to santa mara but by a different route in order to further expand his territory and procure more gold he passed through the regions of teoca pacra bugue bugue bononaima and chorizo defeating some by force and befriending others through diplomacy a particularly bloody battle took place against the cacique tubanam whom balboa eventually defeated in december the expedition arrived back in the caribbean coast by the gulf of san blas a strip of land ruled by cacique pocorosa from there he headed to the lands of comagre to find that his elderly ally had died his son panquiaco was now the new chieftain from there he crossed the lands of ponca and careta to finally arrive in santa mara on january 19 1514 with a treasure in cotton goods more than 100000 castellanos worth of gold to say nothing of the pearls all this however did not compare to the magnitude of the discovery of the south sea on behalf of spain balboa commanded pedro de arbolancha to set sail for spain with news of this discovery he also sent one fifth of the treasure to the king as the law required disputes with pedro arias the accusations of fernndez de enciso whom balboa had deposed and the removal and disappearance of governor ojeda forced the king to name pedro arias de vila as governor of the newly created province of castilla de oro arias better known as pedrarias dvila and who would later become notorious for his cruelty took control of veragua and managed to calm the situation pedrarias arrived from arbolancha spain with an expedition of 1500 men and 17 ships thereby ensuring that balboas requests to the crown for more men and supplies were met this would be to that date the largest and most complete expedition to leave spain for the new world pedrarias was accompanied on this expedition by gaspar de espinosa who held the office of alcalde mayor the very same martn fernndez de enciso whom balboa had forced into exile now as chief constable alguacil mayor the royal officer and chronicler gonzalo fernndez de oviedo as well as several captains among them juan de ayora pedrarias lieutenant there were also several clerics most notably the franciscan friar juan de quevedo appointed bishop of santa mara there were also women among the travellers among them isabel de bobadilla pedrarias wife more than 500 men died from starvation or due to the inclemencies of the weather soon after reaching darin fernndez de oviedo was to note that knights covered in silk and brocade who distinguished themselves valiantly in the italian wars would die consumed by hunger and fever due to the nature of the tropical jungle balboa received pedrarias and his representatives in july 1514 and accepted resignedly his replacement as governor and mayor the settlers however did not like the change and some were planning to take up arms against pedrarias even as balboa showed respect to the new colonial authorities as soon as pedrarias took charge gaspar de espinosa had balboa arrested and tried in absentia sentencing him to pay reparations to fernndez de enciso and others he was however found innocent of the charge of murdering nicuesa so he was freed shortly afterwards due to overpopulation in santa mara pedrarias called on several expeditionaries to search for new locations fit for settlement balboa requested of pedrarias that he be allowed to explore the dabaibe region along the atrato river for there was a rumour of the existence of a temple filled with vast riches there however this expedition turned out to be a failure leaving balboa wounded due to constant attacks by the regions natives this setback however did not deter balboas ambitions of returning to explore the south sea secretly he arranged to recruit a contingent of men from cuba the ship carrying them berthed just outside santa mara and its caretaker informed balboa of their arrival receiving in return 70 gold castellanos pedrarias however soon found out about the ship furious he had balboa arrested took away all his men and was planning to lock him up in a wooden cage he was held back from doing this by bishop de quevedo who appealed to him not to abuse his power on balboa luckily for balboa around that time the spanish crown would finally recognize his valuable services the king bestowed on him the titles of adelantado of the south seas and gobernador of panama and coiba on top of this the king instructed pedrarias to show balboa the greatest respect and to consult him on all matters pertaining to the conquest and government of castilla de oro because of all this pedrarias was to release and exonerate balboa lifting all charges brought up against him in the matter of the clandestine recruitment of an expeditionary party downfall and death at that point the rivalry between balboa and pedrarias ceased abruptly due in large part to the intercession of bishop de quevedo and isabel de bobadilla who arranged for balboas marriage to mara de pealosa one of pedrarias daughters who was in spain shortly thereafter the bishop left for spain and the marriage took place by proxy they would never meet because she was in spain and balboa would never return to his homeland the friendship between pedrarias and balboa lasted barely two years but in that time balboa came to show great filial affection toward his father-in-law balboa wished to continue exploring the south sea but pedrarias did everything possible to delay his departure however in light of the new relationship between them pedrarias could not stop him indefinitely and he finally consented to let balboa go on his new expedition giving him license to explore for a year and a half in 1519 balboa moved to acla with 300 men and using the manpower of the natives and african slaves managed to gather the materials necessary to fashion new ships he traveled up to the balsas river ro balsas where he had four ships built he travelled 74km 46mi through the pacific surrounding the pearl islands and the coasts of darin up to puerto pias so named because of the large amounts of pineapples pias he found there he then returned to acla to continue the construction of sturdier ships on his return however pedrarias wrote warm letters urging balboa to meet him as soon as possible balboa quickly obeyed halfway to santa mara he encountered a group of soldiers commanded by francisco pizarro who arrested him in the name of the governor and accused him of trying to usurp pedrarias power and create a separate government in the south sea outraged balboa denied all charges and demanded that he be taken to spain to stand trial pedrarias however together with martin enciso ordered that the trial take place without delay balboas trial began in january 1519 and on the fifteenth of that month espinosa sentenced him to death by decapitation four of balboas friends fernando de argello luis botello hernn muoz and andrs valderrbano accused as accomplices were sentenced to the same fate the sentence was to be carried out in acla to show that the conspiracy had its roots in that colony as balboa and his friends were being led to the block the town crier announced this is the justice that the king and his lieutenant pedro arias de vila impose upon these men traitors and usurpers of the crowns territories balboa could not restrain his indignation and replied lies lies never have such crimes held a place in my heart i have always loyally served the king with no thought in my mind but to increase his dominions pedrarias observed the execution hidden behind a platform the executioner beheaded balboa and his four friends with an axe balboas head did not come off clean on the first try it took three their heads remained in public display for several days as a sign of pedrarias might the final location of balboas remains is unknown partly because there is no record of what happened in acla after the execution gaspar de espinosa pedrarias underling sailed the south sea aboard the very ships that balboa had commissioned in 1520 ferdinand magellan renamed the sea the pacific ocean because of its calm waters legacy although balboa suffered a premature death his actions and deeds are remembered by history as the first european to cross america several parks and avenues throughout panama bear the name vasco nez de balboa and a number of monuments honour his
