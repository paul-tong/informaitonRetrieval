the subsequent declaration of independence in 1776 the war ended in 1783 with the united states becoming the first country to gain independence from a european power the current constitution was adopted in 1788 with the first ten amendments collectively named the bill of rights being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties the united states embarked on a vigorous expansion across north america throughout the 19th century acquiring new territories displacing native american tribes and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848 during the second half of the 19th century the civil war led to the abolition of slavery by the end of the century the united states had extended into the pacific ocean and its economy driven in large part by the industrial revolution began to soar the spanishamerican war and world war i confirmed the countrys status as a global military power the united states emerged from world war ii as a global

produced a world map on which he named the lands of the western hemisphere america in honor of the italian explorer and cartographer amerigo vespucci latin americus vespucius the first documentary evidence of the phrase united states of america is from a letter dated january 2 1776 written by stephen moylan esq to george washingtons aide-de-camp and muster-master general of the continental army lt col joseph reed moylan expressed his wish to go with full and ample powers from the united states of america to spain to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort the first known publication of the phrase united states of america was in an anonymous essay in the virginia gazette newspaper in williamsburg virginia on april 6 1776 the second draft of the articles of confederation prepared by john dickinson and completed by june 17 1776 at the latest declared the name of this confederation shall be the united states of america the final version of the articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence the stile of this confederacy shall be the united states of america in june 1776 thomas jefferson wrote the phrase united states of america in all capitalized letters in the headline of his original rough draught of the declaration of independence this draft of the document did not surface until june 21 1776 and it is unclear whether it was written before or after dickinson used the term in his june 17 draft of the articles of confederation the short form united states is also standard other common forms are the us the usa and america colloquial names are the us of a and internationally the states columbia a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century derives its origin from christopher columbus it appears in the name district of columbia the phrase united states was originally plural a description of a collection of independent stateseg the united states areincluding in the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution ratified in 1865 the singular formeg the united states isbecame popular after the end of the american civil war the singular form is now standard the plural form is retained in the idiom these united states the difference is more significant than usage it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit a citizen of the united states is an american united states american and us refer to the country adjectivally american values usforces in english the word american rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the united states history indigenous peoples and pre-columbian history it has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 12000 years ago however increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival after crossing the land bridge the first americans moved southward along the pacific coast and through an interior ice-free corridor between the cordilleran and laurentide ice sheets the clovis culture appeared around 11000 bc and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the americas the clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the americas over the years more and more evidence has advanced the idea of pre-clovis cultures including tools dating back about 15550 years ago it is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into north america over time indigenous cultures in north america grew increasingly complex and some such as the pre-columbian mississippian culture in the southeast developed advanced agriculture grand architecture and state-level societies the mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 ad extending from the mexican border down through the florida its city state cahokia is considered the largest most complex pre-columbian archaeological site in the modern-day united states in the four corners region ancestral puebloans culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation which produced greater dependence on farming three unesco world heritage sites in the united states are credited to the pueblos mesa verde national park chaco culture national historical park and taos pueblo the earthworks constructed by native americans of the poverty point culture in northeastern louisiana have also been designated a unesco world heritage site in the southern great lakes region the iroquois confederacy haudenosaunee was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries the date of the first settlements of the hawaiian islands is a topic of continuing debate archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 ad effects on and interaction with native populations while estimating the original native population of north america at the time of european contact is difficult an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by james mooney using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of mexico in 1600 in more recent years douglas h ubelaker of the smithsonian institution has updated these figures while ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92916 in the south atlantic states and a population of 473616 in the gulf states most academics regard the figure as too low anthropologist henry f dobyns believed that the populations were much higher suggestion 1100000 along the shores of the gulf of mexico 2211000 people living between florida and massachusetts 5250000 in the mississippi valley and tributaries and 697000 people in the florida peninsula the first interaction between europeans and native americans was made by the norsemen a number of surviving norse sagas provide information regarding the maritimes and its indigenous people the norse attempted to settle in north america about 500 years before columbus in the early days of colonization many european settlers were subject to food shortages disease and attacks from native americans native americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with europeans in their colonial wars at the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other settlers traded for food and animal pelts natives for guns ammunition and other european wares natives taught many settlers where when and how to cultivate corn beans and squash european missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the native americans and urged them to adopt european agricultural techniques and lifestyles european settlements with the advancement of european colonization in the territories of the contemporary united states the native americans were often conquered and displaced the first europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern united states were spanish conquistadors such as juan ponce de len who made his first visit to florida in 1513 however if unincorporated territories are accounted for then credit would go to christopher columbus who landed in puerto rico on his 1493 voyage the spanish set up the first settlements in florida and new mexico such as saint augustine and santa fe the french established their own as well along the mississippi river successful english settlement on the eastern coast of north america began with the virginia colony in 1607 at jamestown and the pilgrims plymouth colony in 1620 many settlers were dissenting christian groups who came seeking religious freedom the continents first elected legislative assembly virginias house of burgesses created in 1619 the mayflower compact signed by the pilgrims before disembarking and the fundamental orders of connecticut established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period americans were producing one-seventh of the worlds iron supply cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotch-irish and other groups as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west a large-scale slave trade with english privateers was begun the life expectancy of slaves was much higher in north america than further south because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice but by the turn of the 18th century african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions with the british colonization of georgia in 1732 the 13 colonies that would become the united states of america were established all had local governments with elections open to most free men with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism with extremely high birth rates low death rates and steady settlement the colonial population grew rapidly relatively small native american populations were eclipsed the christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the great awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty during the seven years war in the united states known as the french and indian war british forces seized canada from the french but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies excluding the native americans who were being conquered and displaced the 13 british colonies had a population of over 21 million in 1770 about one-third that of britain despite continuing new arrivals the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of americans had been born overseas the colonies distance from britain had allowed the development of self-government but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority in 1774 the spanish navy ship santiago under juan prez entered and anchored in an inlet of nootka sound vancouver island in present-day british columbia although the spanish did not land natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from california at the time the spanish were able to monopolize the trade between asia and north america granting limited licenses to the portuguese when the russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in alaska the spanish began to challenge the russians with prezs voyage being the first of many to the pacific northwest during his third and final voyage captain james cook became the first european to begin formal contact with hawaii after his initial landfall in january 1778 at waimea harbor kauai cook named the archipelago the sandwich islands after the fourth earl of sandwichthe acting first lord of the admiralty of the british royal navy captain james cooks last voyage included sailing along the coast of north america and alaska searching for a northwest passage for approximately nine months after having arrived in the hawaiian islands in 1778 captain cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of north america north of the spanish settlements in alta california he made landfall on the oregon coast at approximately 4430 north latitude naming his landing point cape foulweather bad weather forced his ships south to about 43 north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward in march 1778 cook landed on bligh island and named the inlet king georges sound he recorded that the native name was nutka or nootka apparently misunderstanding his conversations at friendly coveyuquot his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island itchme nutka a place you can go around there may also have been confusion with nuu-chah-nulth the natives autonym a name for themselves it may also have simply been based on cooks mispronunciation of yuquot the native name of the place he returned to hawaii to resupply initially exploring the coasts of maui and the big island trading with locals and then making anchor at kealakekua bay in january 1779 when his ships and company left the islands a ships mast broke in bad weather forcing them to return in mid-february cook would be killed days later independence and expansion 17761865 the american revolutionary war was the first successful colonial war of independence against a european power americans had developed an ideology of republicanism asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures they demanded their rights as englishmen and no taxation without representation the british insisted on administering the empire through parliament and the conflict escalated into war the second continental congress unanimously adopted the declaration of independence on july 4 which recognized in a long preamble that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by great britain and declared in the words of the resolution that the thirteen united colonies formed an independent nation and had no further allegiance to the british crown the fourth day of july is celebrated annually as independence day the second continental congress declared on september 9 where heretofore the words united colonies have been used the stile be altered for the future to the united states in 1777 the articles of confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789 britain recognized the independence of the united states following its defeat at yorktown in 1781 in the peace treaty of 1783 american sovereignty was recognized from the atlantic coast west to the mississippi river nationalists led the philadelphia convention of 1787 in writing the united states constitution ratified in state conventions in 1788 the federal government was reorganized into three branches on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances in 1789 george washington who had led the revolutionary army to victory was the first president elected under the new constitution the bill of rights forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections was adopted in 1791 although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the deep south and along with it the slave population the second great awakening especially 18001840 converted millions to evangelical protestantism in the north it energized multiple social reform movements including abolitionism in the south methodists and baptists proselytized among slave populations americans eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of american indian wars the louisiana purchase of french-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nations area the war of 1812 declared against britain over various grievances and fought to a draw strengthened us nationalism a series of military incursions into florida led spain to cede it and other gulf coast territory in 1819 the expansion was aided by steam power when steamboats began traveling along americas large water systems which were connected by new canals such as the erie and the im then even faster railroads began their stretch across the nations land from 1820 to 1850 jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage it led to the rise of the second party system of democrats and whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854 the trail of tears in the 1830s exemplified the indian removal policy that resettled indians into the west on indian reservations the us annexed the republic of texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist manifest destiny the 1846 oregon treaty with britain led to us control of the present-day american northwest victory in the mexicanamerican war resulted in the 1848 mexican cession of california and much of the present-day american southwest the california gold rush of 184849 spurred western migration the california genocide and the creation of additional western states after the american civil war new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with native americans over a half-century the loss of the american bison sometimes called buffalo was an existential blow to many plains indians culture in 1869 a new peace policy nominally promised to protect native-americans from abuses avoid further war and secure their eventual us citizenship nonetheless large-scale conflicts continued throughout the west into the 1900s civil war and reconstruction era differences of opinion regarding the slavery of africans and african americans ultimately led to the american civil war initially states entering the union had alternated between slave and free states keeping a sectional balance in the senate while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the house of representatives but with additional western territory and more free-soil states tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories whether and how to expand or restrict slavery with the 1860 election of abraham lincoln the first president from the largely anti-slavery republican party conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the confederate states of america the south while the federal government the union maintained that secession was illegal in order to bring about this secession military action was initiated by the secessionists and the union responded in kind the ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in american history resulting in the deaths of approximately 618000 soldiers as well as many civilians the south fought for the freedom to own slaves while the union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole nevertheless as casualties mounted after 1863 and lincoln delivered his emancipation proclamation the main purpose of the war from the unions viewpoint became the abolition of slavery indeed when the union ultimately won the war in april 1865 each of the states in the defeated south was required to ratify the thirteenth amendment which prohibited slavery three amendments were added to the us constitution in the years after the war the aforementioned thirteenth as well as the fourteenth amendment providing citizenship to the nearly four million african americans who had been slaves and the fifteenth amendment ensuring in theory that african americans had the right to vote the war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the south while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves reconstruction began in earnest following the war while president lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the union and the former confederacy an assassins bullet on april 14 1865 drove a wedge between north and south again republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the south and to ensure the rights of african americans they persisted until the compromise of 1877 when the republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of african americans in the south in order for democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876 southern white democrats calling themselves redeemers took control of the south after the end of reconstruction from 1890 to 1910 so-called jim crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region blacks faced racial segregation especially in the south they also occasionally experienced vigilante violence including lynching further immigration expansion and industrialization in the north urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from southern and eastern europe supplied a surplus of labor for the countrys industrialization and transformed its culture national infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the american old west the later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life the united states fought indian wars west of the mississippi river from 1810 to at least 1890 most of these conflicts ended with the cession of native american territory and the confinement of the latter to indian reservations this further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation increasing surpluses for international markets mainland expansion also included the purchase of alaska from russia in 1867 in 1893 pro-american elements in hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the republic of hawaii which the us annexed in 1898 puerto rico guam and the philippines were ceded by spain in the same year following the spanishamerican war american samoa was acquired by the united states in 1900 after the end of the second samoan civil war the united states purchased the us virgin islands from denmark in 1917 rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists tycoons like cornelius vanderbilt john d rockefeller and andrew carnegie led the nations progress in railroad petroleum and steel industries banking became a major part of the economy with j p morgan playing a notable role edison and tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry homes and for street lighting henry ford revolutionized the automotive industry the american economy boomed becoming the worlds largest and the united states achieved great power status these dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist socialist and anarchist movements this period eventually ended with the advent of the progressive era which saw significant reforms in many societal areas including womens suffrage alcohol prohibition regulation of consumer goods greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions world war i great depression and world war ii the united states remained neutral from the outbreak of world war i in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an associated power alongside the formal allies of world war i helping to turn the tide against the central powers in 1919 president woodrow wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the paris peace conference and advocated strongly for the us to join the league of nations however the senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the treaty of versailles that established the league of nations in 1920 the womens rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting womens suffrage the 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television the prosperity of the roaring twenties ended with the wall street crash of 1929 and the onset of the great depression after his election as president in 1932 franklin d roosevelt responded with the new deal which included the establishment of the social security system the great migration of millions of african americans out of the american south began before world war i and extended through the 1960s whereas the dust bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration at first effectively neutral during world war ii while germany conquered much of continental europe the united states began supplying material to the allies in march 1941 through the lend-lease program on december 7 1941 the empire of japan launched a surprise attack on pearl harbor prompting the united states to join the allies against the axis powers during the war the united states was referred as one of the four policemen of allies power who met to plan the postwar world along with britain the soviet union and china although the nation lost more than 400000 soldiers it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence the united states played a leading role in the bretton woods and yalta conferences with the united kingdom the soviet union and other allies which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and europes postwar reorganization as an allied victory was won in europe a 1945 international conference held in san francisco produced the united nations charter which became active after the war the united states developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on japan in the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki causing the japanese to surrender on september 2 ending world war ii parades and celebrations followed in what is known as victory day or v-j day cold war and civil rights era after world war ii the united states and the soviet union jockeyed for power during what became known as the cold war driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism and according to the school of geopolitics a divide between the maritime atlantic and the continental eurasian camps they dominated the military affairs of europe with the us and its nato allies on one side and the ussr and its warsaw pact allies on the other the us developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence while the us and soviet union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals the two countries avoided direct military conflict the united states often opposed third world movements that it viewed as soviet-sponsored and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments american troops fought communist chinese and north korean forces in the korean war of 195053 the soviet unions 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a space race in which the united states became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969 a proxy war in southeast asia eventually evolved into full american participation as the vietnam war at home the us experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class construction of an interstate highway system transformed the nations infrastructure over the following decades millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments in 1959 hawaii became the 50th and last us state added to the country the growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination with martin luther king jr becoming a prominent leader and figurehead a combination of court decisions and legislation culminating in the civil rights act of 1968 sought to end racial discrimination meanwhile a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the vietnam war black nationalism and the sexual revolution the launch of a war on poverty expanded entitlements and welfare spending including the creation of medicare and medicaid two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor respectively and the means-tested food stamp program and aid to families with dependent children the 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation after his election in 1980 president ronald reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms following the collapse of dtente he abandoned containment and initiated the more aggressive rollback strategy towards the ussr after a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed the late 1980s brought a thaw in relations with the ussr and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the cold war this brought about unipolarity with the us unchallenged as the worlds dominant superpower the concept of pax americana which had appeared in the post-world war ii period gained wide popularity as a term for the post-cold war new world order contemporary history after the cold war the conflict in the middle east triggered a crisis in 1990 when iraq under saddam hussein invaded and attempted to annex kuwait an ally of the united states fearing that the instability would spread to other regions president george hw bush launched operation desert shield a defensive force buildup in saudi arabia and operation desert storm in a staging titled the gulf war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the united states against iraq ending in the successful expulsion of iraqi forces from kuwait restoring the former monarchy originating in us defense networks the internet spread to international academic networks and then to the public in the 1990s greatly affecting the global economy society and culture due to the dot-com boom stable monetary policy under alan greenspan and reduced social welfare spending the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern us history ending in 2001 beginning in 1994 the us entered into the north american free trade agreement nafta linking 450 million people producing 17 trillion worth of goods and services the goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the us canada and mexico by january 1 2008 trade among the three partners has soared since nafta went into force on september 11 2001 al-qaeda terrorists struck the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon near washington dc killing nearly 3000 people in response the united states launched the war on terror which included war in afghanistan and the 200311 iraq war in 2007 the bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the iraq war which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region government policy designed to promote affordable housing widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance and historically low interest rates set by the federal reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis the largest economic contraction in the nations history since the great depression barack obama the first african-american and multiracial president was elected in 2008 amid the crisis and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis the stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment dodd-frank improved financial stability and consumer protection although there has been debate about its effects on the economy in 2010 the obama administration passed the affordable care act which made the most sweeping reforms to the nations healthcare system in nearly five decades including mandates subsidies and insurance exchanges the law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance with 24 million covered during 2016 but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs insurance premiums and economic performance although the recession reached its trough in june 2009 voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery the republicans who stood in opposition to obamas policies won control of the house of representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the senate in 2014 american forces in iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010 and the war in the region was declared formally over in december 2011 the withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency leading to the rise of the islamic state of iraq and the levant the successor of al-qaeda in the region in 2014 obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with cuba for the first time since 1961 the next year the united states as a member of the p51 countries signed the joint comprehensive plan of action an agreement aimed to slow the development of irans nuclear program though the us withdrew from the deal in may 2018 in the united states presidential election of 2016 republican donald trump was elected as the 45th president of the united states trump is both the oldest and wealthiest person elected president

united states are levied at the federal state and local government levels these include taxes on income payroll property sales imports estates and gifts as well as various fees taxation in the united states is based on citizenship not residency both non-resident citizens and green card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned it is the only country in the world other than eritrea to do so in 2010 taxes collected by federal state and municipal governments amounted to 248 of gdp during fy2012 the federal government collected

insurance taxes 845b or 35 and corporate taxes 242b or 10 based on cbo estimates under 2013 tax law the top 1 will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979 while other income groups will remain at historic lows us taxation has historically been generally progressive especially the federal income taxes though by most measures it became noticeably less progressive after 1980 it has sometimes been described as among the most progressive in the developed world but this characterization is controversial the highest 10 of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes and about half of all taxes payroll taxes for social security are a flat regressive tax with no tax charged on income above 118500 for 2015 and 2016 and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains the historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers however according to the congressional budget office the net effect of social security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70 for the top earnings quintile to about 170 for the lowest earning quintile making the system progressive the top 10 paid 518 of total federal taxes in 2009 and the top 1 with 134 of pre-tax national income paid 223 of federal taxes in 2013 the tax policy center projected total federal effective tax rates of 355 for the top 1 272 for the top quintile 138 for the middle quintile and 27 for the bottom quintile the incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades state and local taxes vary widely but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation during fy 2012 the federal government spent 354 trillion on a

and rising petroleum and food prices science and technology the united states has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the us war department by the federal armories during the first half of the 19th century this technology along with the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the us to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the american system of manufacturing factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production in 1876 alexander graham bell was awarded the first us patent for the telephone thomas edisons research laboratory one of the first of its kind developed the phonograph the first long-lasting light bulb and the first viable movie camera the latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry in the early 20th century the automobile companies of ransom e olds and henry ford popularized the assembly line the wright brothers in 1903 made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight the rise of fascism and nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many european scientists including albert einstein enrico fermi and john von neumann to immigrate to the united states during world war ii the manhattan project developed nuclear weapons ushering in the atomic age while the space race produced rapid advances in rocketry materials science and aeronautics the invention of the transistor in the 1950s a key active component in practically all modern electronics led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the us technology industry this in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as silicon valley in california advancements by american microprocessor companies such as advanced micro devices amd and intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include adobe systems apple inc ibm microsoft and sun microsystems created and popularized the personal computer the arpanet was developed in the 1960s to meet defense department requirements and became the first

growth although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income there has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s however the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance the rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011 has significantly affected income inequality leaving the united states with one of the widest income distributions among oecd nations according to a 2018 study by the oecd the united states has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation this is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system the top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015 where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers the extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of

vehicles per 1000 people mass transit accounts for 9 of total us work trips transport of goods by rail is extensive though relatively low numbers of passengers approximately 31 million annually use intercity rail to travel partly because of the low population density throughout much of the us interior however ridership on amtrak the national intercity passenger rail system grew by almost 37 between 2000 and 2010 also light rail development has increased in recent years bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal the civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely

energy market is about 29000 terawatt hours per year energy consumption per capita is 78tons 7076kg of oil equivalent per year the 10th-highest rate in the world in 2005 40 of this energy came from petroleum 23 from coal and 22 from natural gas the remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources the united states is the worlds largest consumer of petroleum the united states has 27 of global coal reserves it is the worlds largest producer of natural gas and crude oil for decades nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident in 2007 several applications for new nuclear plants were filed water supply and sanitation issues that affect water supply in the united states include droughts in the west water scarcity pollution a backlog of investment concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest and a rapidly retiring workforce increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows culture the united states is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups traditions and values aside from the native american native hawaiian and native alaskan populations nearly all americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries mainstream american culture is a western culture largely derived from the traditions of european immigrants with influences from many other sources such as traditions brought by slaves from africa more recent immigration from asia and especially latin america has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics core american culture was established by protestant british colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic competitiveness and individualism as well as a unifying belief in an american creed emphasizing liberty equality private property

any other nation studied more than twice the second place british figure of 073 and around twelve times the french figure of 014 the american dream or the perception that americans enjoy high social mobility plays a key role in attracting immigrants whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate while mainstream culture holds that the united states is a classless society scholars identify significant differences between the countrys social classes affecting socialization language and values americans self-images social viewpoints and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree while americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute food mainstream american cuisine is similar to that in other western countries wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients such as turkey venison potatoes sweet potatoes corn squash and maple syrup which were consumed by native americans and early european settlers these homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of americas most popular holidays thanksgiving when some americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion characteristic dishes such as apple pie fried chicken pizza hamburgers and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants french fries mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos and pasta dishes freely adapted from italian sources are widely consumed americans drink three times as much coffee as tea marketing by us industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages american eating habits owe a great deal to that of their british culinary roots with some variations although american lands could grow newer vegetables that britain could not most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by europeans over time american foods changed to a point that food critic john l hess stated in 1972 our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence the american fast food industry the worlds largest pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s fast food consumption has sparked health concerns during the 1980s and 1990s americans caloric intake rose 24 frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the american obesity epidemic
