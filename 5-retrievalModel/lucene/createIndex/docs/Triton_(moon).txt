triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet neptune and the first neptunian moon to be discovered the discovery was made on october 10 1846 by english astronomer william lassell it is the only large moon in the solar system with a retrograde orbit an orbit in the direction opposite to its planets rotation at 2710 kilometres 1680mi in diameter it is the seventh-largest moon in the solar system and the only moon of neptune massive enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to plutos triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet captured from the kuiper belt it has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen a mostly water-ice crust an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal the core makes up two-thirds of its total mass the mean density is 2061gcm reflecting a composition of approximately 1535 water ice triton is one of the few moons in the solar system known to be geologically active the others being jupiters io and europa and saturns enceladus and titan as a consequence its surface is relatively young with few obvious impact craters intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains suggest a complex geological history part of its surface has geysers erupting sublimated nitrogen gas contributing to a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than 170000 the pressure of earths atmosphere at sea level it is the second-largest planetary moon in relation to its primary after earths moon discovery and naming triton was discovered by british astronomer william lassell on october 10 1846 just 17days after the discovery of neptune he discovered triton with his self-built 61cm telescope a brewer by trade lassell began making mirrors for his amateur telescope in 1820 when john herschel received news of neptunes discovery he wrote to lassell suggesting he search for possible moons lassell did so and discovered triton eight days later lassell also claimed to have discovered rings although neptune was later confirmed to have rings they are so faint and dark that it is doubtful that he actually saw them triton is named after the greek sea god triton the son of poseidon the greek god comparable to the roman neptune the name was first proposed by camille flammarion in his 1880 book astronomie populaire and was officially adopted many decades later until the discovery of the second moon nereid in 1949 triton was commonly referred to as the satellite of neptune lassell did not name his own discovery he later successfully suggested the name hyperion previously chosen by john herschel for the eighth moon of saturn when he discovered it orbit and rotation triton is unique among all large moons in the solar system for its retrograde orbit around its planet ie it orbits in a direction opposite to the planets rotation most of the outer irregular moons of jupiter and saturn also have retrograde orbits as do some of uranuss outer moons however these moons are all much more distant from their primaries and are small in comparison the largest of them phoebe has only 8 of the diameter and 003 of the mass of triton tritons orbit is associated with two tilts the inclination of neptunes spin to neptunes orbit 30 and the inclination of tritons orbit to neptunes spin 157 an inclination over 90 indicates retrograde motion tritons orbit precesses forward relative to neptunes spin with a period of about 678 earth years 41 neptunian years making its neptune-orbit-relative inclination vary between 127 and 180 and in the past to 173 that inclination is currently 130 tritons orbit is now near its maximum departure from coplanarity with neptunes tritons rotation is tidally locked to be synchronous with its orbit around neptune it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane at the present time tritons rotational axis is about 40 from neptunes orbital plane and hence at some point during neptunes year each pole points fairly close to the sun almost like the poles of uranus as neptune orbits the sun tritons polar regions take turns facing the sun resulting in seasonal changes as one pole then the other moves into the sunlight such changes were observed in 2010 tritons revolution around neptune has become a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought to be capable of circularizing tritons orbit in the time since the origin of the system and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role tidal interactions also cause tritons orbit which is already closer to neptune than the moons is to earth to gradually decay further predictions are that 36billion years from now triton will pass within neptunes roche limit this will result in either a collision with neptunes atmosphere or the breakup of triton forming a new ring system similar to that found around saturn capture moons in retrograde orbits cannot form in the same region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit so triton must have been captured from elsewhere it might therefore have originated in the kuiper belt a ring of small icy objects extending from just inside the orbit of neptune to about 50au from the sun thought to be the point of origin for the majority of short-period comets observed from earth the belt is also home to several large planet-like bodies including pluto which is now recognized as the largest in a population of kuiper belt objects the plutinos locked in orbital step with neptune triton is only slightly larger than pluto and nearly identical in composition which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin the proposed capture of triton may explain several features of the neptunian system including the extremely eccentric orbit of neptunes moon nereid and the scarcity of moons as compared to the other giant planets tritons initially eccentric orbit would have intersected orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons dispersing them through gravitational interactions tritons eccentric post-capture orbit would have also resulted in tidal heating of its interior which could have kept triton fluid for a billion years this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in tritons interior this source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit two types of mechanisms have been proposed for tritons capture to be gravitationally captured by a planet a passing body must lose sufficient energy to be slowed down to a speed less than that required to escape an early theory of how triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object either one that happened to be passing by neptune which is unlikely or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around neptune which is more likely a more recent hypothesis suggests that before its capture triton was part of a binary system when this binary encountered neptune it interacted in such a way that the binary dissociated with one portion of the binary expelled and the other triton becoming bound to neptune this event is more likely for more massive companions similar mechanisms have been proposed for the capture of marss moons this hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence including binaries being very common among the large kuiper belt objects the event was brief but gentle saving triton from collisional disruption events like this may have been common during the formation of neptune or later when it migrated outward however simulations in 2017 showed that after tritons capture and before its orbital eccentricity decreased it probably did collide with at least one other moon and caused collisions between other moons physical characteristics triton is the seventh-largest moon and sixteenth-largest object in the solar system and is modestly larger than the dwarf planets pluto and eris it comprises more than 995 of all the mass known to orbit neptune including the planets rings and thirteen other known moons and is also more massive than all known moons in the solar system smaller than itself combined also with a diameter 55 that of neptune it is the largest moon of a gas giant relative to its planet in terms of diameter although titan is bigger relative to saturn in terms of mass it has a radius density 2061 gcm temperature and chemical composition similar to those of pluto tritons surface is covered with a transparent layer of annealed frozen nitrogen only 40 of tritons surface has been observed and studied but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice like plutos tritons crust consists of 55 nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in water ice comprises 1535 and frozen carbon dioxide dry ice the remaining 1020 trace ices include 01 methane and 005 carbon monoxide there could also be ammonia ice on the surface as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere tritons mean density implies that it probably consists of about 3045 water ice including relatively small amounts of volatile ices with the remainder being rocky material tritons surface area is 23millionkm which is 45 of earth or 155 of earths land area triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo reflecting 6095 of the sunlight that reaches it and it has changed slightly since the first observations by comparison the moon reflects only 11 tritons reddish colour is thought to be the result of methane ice which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation because tritons surface indicates a long history of melting models of its interior posit that triton is differentiated like earth into a solid core a mantle and a crust water the most abundant volatile in the solar system comprises tritons mantle enveloping a core of rock and metal there is enough rock in tritons interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day the heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of europa the black material ejected is suspected to contain organic compounds and if liquid water is present in triton it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life atmosphere triton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere with trace amounts of carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane near its surface like plutos atmosphere the atmosphere of triton is thought to have resulted from evaporation of nitrogen from its surface its surface temperature is at least 7001356000000000000356k 70013554999999999992376c because tritons nitrogen ice is in the warmer hexagonal crystalline state and the phase transition between hexagonal and cubic nitrogen ice occurs at that temperature an upper limit in the low 40s k can be set from vapor pressure equilibrium with nitrogen gas in tritons atmosphere this is colder than plutos average equilibrium temperature of 700144000000000000044k 7001441499999999999229c tritons surface atmospheric pressure is only about 14700019000000000000019pa 001470001900000000000000019mbar turbulence at tritons surface creates a troposphere a weather region rising to an altitude of 8km streaks on tritons surface left by geyser plumes suggest that the troposphere is driven by seasonal winds capable of moving material of over a micrometre in size unlike other atmospheres tritons lacks a stratosphere and instead has a thermosphere from altitudes of 8 to 950km and an exosphere above that the temperature of tritons upper atmosphere at 7001950000000000000955k is higher than that at its surface due to heat absorbed from solar radiation and neptunes magnetosphere a haze permeates most of tritons troposphere thought to be composed largely of hydrocarbons and nitriles created by the action of sunlight on methane tritons atmosphere also has clouds of condensed nitrogen that lie between 1 and 3km from its surface in 1997 observations from earth were made of tritons limb as it passed in front of stars these observations indicated the presence of a denser atmosphere than was deduced from voyager 2 data other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5 from 1989 to 1998 these observations indicate triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on tritons surface and a change in ice albedo which would allow more heat to be absorbed another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark red material from geological processes because tritons bond albedo is among the highest within the solar system it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo surface features all detailed knowledge of the surface of triton was acquired from a distance of 40000km by the voyager 2 spacecraft during a single encounter in 1989 the 40 of tritons surface imaged by voyager 2 revealed blocky outcrops ridges troughs furrows hollows plateaus icy plains and few craters triton is relatively flat its observed topography never varies beyond a kilometer there are relatively few impact craters on triton recent analysis of crater density and distribution has suggested that in geological terms tritons surface is extremely young with regions varying from an estimated 50million years old to just an estimated 6million years old 55 of tritons surface is covered with frozen nitrogen with water ice comprising 1535 and dry ice aka frozen carbon dioxide forming the remaining 1020 the surface shows deposits of tholins organic compounds that may be precursor chemicals to the origin of life cryovolcanism triton is geologically active its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters although tritons crust is made of various ices its subsurface processes are similar to those that produce volcanoes and rift valleys on earth but with water and ammonia as opposed to liquid rock tritons entire surface is cut by complex valleys and ridges probably the result of tectonics and icy volcanism the vast majority of surface features on triton are endogenicthe result of internal geological processes rather than external processes such as impacts most are volcanic and extrusive in nature rather than tectonic the voyager 2 probe observed in 1989 a handful of geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from beneath the surface of triton in plumes up to 8km high triton is thus along with earth io and enceladus one of the few bodies in the solar system on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed the best-observed examples are named hili and mahilani after a zulu water sprite and a tongan sea spirit respectively all the geysers observed were located between 50 and 57s the part of tritons surface close to the subsolar point this indicates that solar heating although very weak at tritons great distance from the sun plays a crucial role it is thought that the surface of triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate which creates a kind of solid greenhouse effect solar radiation passes through the thin surface ice sheet slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust a temperature increase of just 4k above the ambient surface temperature of 37k could drive eruptions to the heights observed although commonly termed cryovolcanic this nitrogen plume activity is distinct from tritons larger scale cryovolcanic eruptions as well as volcanic processes on other worlds which are powered by the internal heat of the body in question analogous co2 geysers on mars are thought to erupt from its south polar cap each spring each eruption of a triton geyser may last up to a year driven by the sublimation of about 100million cubic metres 3510 cuft of nitrogen ice over this interval dust entrained may be deposited up to 150km downwind in visible streaks and perhaps much farther in more diffuse deposits voyager 2s images of tritons southern hemisphere show many such streaks of dark material between 1977 and the voyager 2 flyby in 1989 triton shifted from a reddish colour similar to pluto to a far paler hue suggesting that lighter nitrogen frosts had covered older reddish material the eruption of volatiles from tritons equator and their deposition at the poles may redistribute enough mass over the course of 10000 years to cause polar wander polar cap plains and ridges tritons south polar region is covered by a highly reflective cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers little is known about the north pole because it was on the night side during the voyager 2 encounter but it is thought that triton must also have a north polar ice cap the high plains found on tritons eastern hemisphere such as cipango planum cover over and blot out older features and are therefore almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape the plains are dotted with pits such as leviathan patera which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged the composition of the lava is unknown although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected four roughly circular walled plains have been identified on triton they are the flattest regions so far discovered with a variance in altitude of less than 200m they are thought to have formed from eruption of icy lava the plains near tritons eastern limb are dotted with black spots the maculae some maculae are simple dark spots with diffuse boundaries and others comprise a dark central patch surrounded by a white halo with sharp boundaries the maculae typically have diameters of about 100km and widths of the halos of between 20 and 30km there are extensive ridges and valleys in complex patterns across tritons surface probably the result of freezethaw cycles many also appear to be tectonic in nature and may result from extension or strike-slip faulting there are long double ridges of ice with central troughs bearing a strong resemblance to europan lineae although they have a larger scale and which may have a similar origin possibly shear heating from strike-slip motion along faults caused by diurnal tidal stresses experienced before tritons orbit was fully circularized these faults with parallel ridges expelled from the interior cross complex terrain with valleys in the equatorial region the ridges and furrows or sulci such as yasu sulci ho sulci and lo sulci are thought to be of intermediate age in tritons geological history and in many cases to have formed concurrently they tend to be clustered in groups or packets cantaloupe terrain tritons western hemisphere consists of a strange series of fissures and depressions known as cantaloupe terrain because of its resemblance to the skin of a cantaloupe melon although it has few craters it is thought that this is the oldest terrain on triton it probably covers much of tritons western half cantaloupe terrain which is mostly dirty water ice is only known to exist on triton it contains depressions 3040km in diameter the depressions cavi are probably not impact craters because they are all of similar size and have smooth curves the leading hypothesis for their formation is diapirism the rising of lumps of less dense material through a stratum of denser material alternative hypotheses include formation by collapses or by flooding caused by cryovolcanism impact craters due to constant erasure and modification by ongoing geological activity impact craters on tritons surface are relatively rare a census of tritons craters imaged by voyager 2 found only 179 that were incontestably of impact origin compared with 835 observed for uranuss moon miranda which has only three percent of tritons surface area the largest crater observed on triton thought to have been created by an impact is a 27km-diameter feature called mazomba although larger craters have been observed they are generally thought to be volcanic in nature the few impact craters on triton are almost all concentrated in the leading hemispherethat facing the direction of the orbital motionwith the majority concentrated around the equator between 30 and 70 longitude resulting from material swept up from orbit around neptune because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet astronomers expect that triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent voyager 2 imaged only 40 of tritons surface so this remains uncertain observation and exploration the orbital properties of triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century it was found to have a retrograde orbit at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of neptunes orbit the first detailed observations of triton were not made until 1930 little was known about the satellite until voyager 2 flew by in 1989 before the flyby of voyager 2 astronomers suspected that triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogenmethane atmosphere with a density as much as 30 that of earth like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of mars this proved incorrect as with mars a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history the first attempt to measure the diameter of triton was made by gerard kuiper in 1954 he obtained a value of 3800km subsequent measurement attempts arrived at values ranging from 2500 to 6000km or from slightly smaller than the moon 34742km to nearly half the diameter of earth data from the approach of voyager 2 to neptune on august 25 1989 led to a more accurate estimate of tritons diameter 2706km in the 1990s various observations from earth were made of the limb of triton using the occultation of nearby stars which indicated the presence of an atmosphere and an exotic surface observations in late 1997 suggests that triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when voyager 2 flew past in 1989 new concepts for missions to the neptune system to be conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by nasa scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades all of them identified triton as being a prime target and a separate triton lander comparable to the huygens probe for titan was frequently included in those plans no efforts aimed at neptune and triton went beyond the proposal phase and nasas funding on missions to the outer solar system is currently focused on the jupiter and saturn systems a proposed lander mission to triton called triton hopper would mine nitrogen ice from the surface of triton and process it to be used as small rocket propellant and fly or hop across the surface on 5 october 2017
