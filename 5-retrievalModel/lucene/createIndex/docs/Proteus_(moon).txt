proteus protis proh-tee-s greek also known as neptuneviii is the second-largest neptunian moon and neptunes largest inner satellite discovered by voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989 it is named after proteus the shape-changing sea god of greek mythology proteus orbits neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at the distance of about 475 equatorial radii of the planet despite being a predominantly icy body more than 400km in diameter proteuss shape deviates significantly from an ellipsoid it is shaped more like an irregular polyhedron with several slightly concave facets and relief as high as 20km its surface is dark neutral in color and heavily cratered proteuss largest crater is pharos which is more than 230km in diameter there are also a number of scarps grooves and valleys related to large craters proteus is probably not an original body that formed with neptune it could have accreted later from the debris formed when the largest neptunian satellite triton was captured discovery and orbit proteus was discovered from the images taken by voyager 2 space probe two months before its neptune flyby in august 1989 it received the temporary designation s1989n1 stephen p synnott and bradford a smith announced its discovery on july 7 1989 speaking only of 17 frames taken over 21 days which gives a discovery date of sometime before june 16 on 16 september 1991 s1989n1 was named after proteus the shape-changing sea god of greek mythology proteus orbits neptune at the distance approximately equal to 475 equatorial radii of the planet its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined by about 05 to the planets equator proteus is the largest of the regular prograde satellites of neptune it rotates synchronously with the orbital motion which means that one face always points to the planet physical characteristics proteus is the second-largest moon of neptune it is about 420 kilometres in diameter larger than nereid the second to be discovered it was not discovered by earth-based telescopes because it is so close to neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight the surface of proteus is darkits geometrical albedo is about 10 the color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green in the near-infrared around 2m proteuss surface becomes less reflective pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides these compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner neptunian moons although proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface the shape of proteus is close to a sphere with a radius of about 210km although deviations from the spherical shape are largeup to 20km scientists believe it is about as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity saturns moon mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than proteus perhaps due to the higher temperature near saturn or tidal heating proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of neptune although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid the surface of proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter they are probably degraded impact craters proteus is heavily cratered showing no sign of any geological modification the largest crater pharos has a diameter from 230 to 260 km its depth is about 1015km the crater has a central dome on its floor a few kilometres high pharos is the only named surface feature on this moon the name is greek and refers to the island where proteus reigned in addition to pharos there are several craters 50100km in diameter and many more with diameters less than 50km the second landform found on proteus is linear features such as scarps valleys and grooves the most prominent one runs parallel to the equator to the west of pharos these features likely formed as a result of the giant impacts which formed pharos and other large craters or as a result of tidal stresses from neptune origin proteus like the other inner satellites of neptune is unlikely to be an original body that formed with it and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after tritons capture tritons orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner neptunian satellites causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble only after tritons orbit became circularised did some of the rubble disc re-accrete into the present-day satellites gallery a simulated view of proteus
