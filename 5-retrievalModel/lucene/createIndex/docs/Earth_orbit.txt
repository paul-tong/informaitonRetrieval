a geocentric orbit or earth orbit involves any object orbiting planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites in 1997 nasa estimated there were approximately 2465 artificial satellite payloads orbiting the earth and 6216 pieces of space debris as tracked by the goddard space flight center over 16291 previously launched objects have decayed into the earths atmosphere a spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity for a low earth orbit this velocity is about 7800ms 28100kmh 17400mph by contrast the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was 2200ms 7900kmh 4900mph in 1967 by the north american x-15 the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600km 370mi is about 36mjkg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude spacecraft with a perigee below about 2000km 1200mi are subject to drag from the earths atmosphere which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellites cross-sectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere below about 300km 190mi decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to 180km 110mi it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere the escape velocity required to pull free of earths gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11200ms 40300kmh 25100mph list of terms and concepts geocentric orbit types the following is a list of different geocentric orbit classifications altitude classifications inclination classifications eccentricity classifications directional classifications geosynchronous classifications special classifications non-geocentric classifications tangential velocities at altitude see also spaceflight portal earths orbit list of orbits astrodynamics celestial sphere heliocentric orbit areosynchronous satellite areostationary satellite escape velocity satellite space station httpwwwfreemarsorgjeffspeedindexhtm httpwwwtech-faqcommedium-earth-orbitshtml httpwwwhqnasagovofficepaohistoryconghandtrajecthtm httpswebarchiveorgweb20100221072300httpwwwspacecomscienceastronomysolarsystemsecondmoon991029html httpwwwastrouwocawiegert37533753html httpwwwastrouwocawiegertaa29aa29html
