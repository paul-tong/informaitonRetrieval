new horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was launched as a part of nasas new frontiers program engineered by the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory apl and the southwest research institute swri with a team led by s alan stern the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the pluto system in 2015 and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other kuiper belt objects kbos in the decade to follow which as of 2019 includes 2014 mu69 it is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the solar system on january 19 2006 new horizons was launched from cape canaveral air force station by an atlas v rocket directly into an earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 1626kms 1010mis 58500kmh 36400mph it was the fastest man-made object ever launched from earth after a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 apl new horizons proceeded to jupiter making its closest approach on february 28 2007 at a distance of 23million kilometers 14million miles the jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased new horizons speed the flyby also enabled a general test of new horizons scientific capabilities returning data about the planets atmosphere moons and magnetosphere most of the post-jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems except for brief annual checkouts on december 6 2014 new horizons was brought back online for the pluto encounter and instrument check-out began on january 15 2015 the spacecraft began its approach phase to pluto on july 14 2015 at 1149utc it flew 12500km 7800mi above the surface of pluto making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet on october 25 2016 at 2148utc the last of the recorded data from the pluto flyby was received from new horizons having completed its flyby of pluto new horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of kuiper belt object 486958 2014 mu69 ultima thule which occurred on january 1 2019 when it was 434au from the sun in august 2018 nasa cited results by alice on new horizons to confirm the existence of a hydrogen wall at the outer edges of the solar system this wall was first detected in 1992 by the two voyager spacecraft history in august 1992 jpl scientist robert staehle called pluto discoverer clyde tombaugh requesting permission to visit his planet i told him he was welcome to it tombaugh later remembered though hes got to go one long cold trip the call eventually led to a series of proposed pluto missions leading up to new horizons stamatios tom krimigis head of the applied physics laboratorys space division one of many entrants in the new frontiers program competition formed the new horizons team with alan stern in december 2000 appointed as the projects principal investigator stern was described by krimigis as the personification of the pluto mission new horizons was based largely on sterns work since pluto 350 and involved most of the team from pluto kuiper express the new horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to nasa it was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in june 2001 the other finalist posse pluto and outer solar system explorer was a separate but similar pluto mission concept by the university of colorado boulder led by principal investigator larry w esposito and supported by the jpl lockheed martin and the university of california however the apl in addition to being supported by pluto kuiper express developers at the goddard space flight center and stanford university were at an advantage they had recently developed near shoemaker for nasa which had successfully entered orbit around 433 eros earlier in the year and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare in november 2001 new horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the new frontiers program however the new nasa administrator appointed by the bush administration sean okeefe was not supportive of new horizons and effectively cancelled it by not including it in nasas budget for 2003 nasas associate administrator for the science mission directorate ed weiler prompted stern to lobby for the funding of new horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the planetary science decadal survey a prioritized wish list compiled by the united states national research council that reflects the opinions of the scientific community after an intense campaign to gain support for new horizons the planetary science decadal survey of 20032013 was published in the summer of 2002 new horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category ahead of missions to the moon and even jupiter weiler stated that it was a result that his administration was not going to fight funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report and sterns team were finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments with a planned launch in january 2006 and arrival at pluto in 2015 alice bowman became mission operations manager mission profile new horizons is the first mission in nasas new frontiers mission category larger and more expensive than the discovery missions but smaller than the flagship program the cost of the mission including spacecraft and instrument development launch vehicle mission operations data analysis and educationpublic outreach is approximately 700million over 15 years 20012016 the spacecraft was built primarily by southwest research institute swri and the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory the missions principal investigator is alan stern of the southwest research institute formerly nasa associate administrator after separation from the launch vehicle overall control was taken by mission operations center moc at the applied physics laboratory in howard county maryland the science instruments are operated at clyde tombaugh science operations center t-soc in boulder colorado navigation is performed at various contractor facilities whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the naval observatory flagstaff station through headquarters nasa and jpl kinetx is the lead on the new horizons navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer solar system coincidentally the naval observatory flagstaff station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of plutos moon charon and the naval observatory is itself not far from the lowell observatory where pluto was discovered new horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the solarsystem when the spacecraft was launched pluto was still classified as a planet later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union iau some members of the new horizons team including alan stern disagree with the iau definition and still describe pluto as the ninth planet plutos satellites nix and hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft the first letters of their names n and h are the initials of new horizons the moons discoverers chose these names for this reason plus nix and hydras relationship to the mythological pluto in addition to the science equipment there are several cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft these include a collection of 434738 names stored on a compact disc a piece of scaled compositess spaceshipone a not yet explored usps stamp and a flag of the united states along with other mementos about 30 grams 1oz of clyde tombaughs ashes are aboard the spacecraft to commemorate his discovery of pluto in 1930 a florida-state quarter coin whose design commemorates human exploration is included officially as a trim weight one of the science packages a dust counter is named after venetia burney who as a child suggested the name pluto after its discovery goal the goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the plutonian system the kuiper belt and the transformation of the early solar system the spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres surfaces interiors and environments of pluto and its moons it will also study other objects in the kuiper belt by way of comparison new horizons gathered 5000 times as much data at pluto as mariner did at the red planet some of the questions the mission attempts to answer are what is plutos atmosphere made of and how does it behave what does its surface look like are there large geological structures how do solar wind particles interact with plutos atmosphere specifically the missions science objectives are to map the surface composition of pluto and charon characterize the geology and morphology of pluto and charon characterize the neutral atmosphere of pluto and its escape rate search for an atmosphere around charon map surface temperatures on pluto and charon search for rings and additional satellites around pluto conduct similar investigations of one or more kuiper belt objects design and construction spacecraft subsystems the spacecraft is comparable in size and general shape to a grand piano and has been compared to a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish as a point of departure the team took inspiration from the ulysses spacecraft which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer solar system many subsystems and components have flight heritage from apls contour spacecraft which in turn had heritage from apls timed spacecraft new horizons body forms a triangle almost 076m 25ft thick the pioneers have hexagonal bodies whereas the voyagers galileo and cassinihuygens have decagonal hollow bodies a 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the rear and the 21m 6ft 11in radio dish antenna affixed to the front flat side the titanium fuel tank is in this tube the rtg attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool titanium provides strength and thermal isolation the rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminium facesheet less than 64in or 040mm bonded to aluminium honeycomb core the structure is larger than strictly necessary with empty space inside the structure is designed to act as shielding reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the rtg also the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle the interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer overall the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat unlike the pioneers and voyagers the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body the heat from the rtg adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer solar system while in the inner solar system the spacecraft must prevent overheating hence electronic activity is limited power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat while the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer solar system the louvers are closed and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters propulsion and attitude control new horizons has both spin-stabilized cruise and three-axis stabilized science modes controlled entirely with hydrazine monopropellant additional post launch delta-v of over 290ms 1000kmh 650mph is provided by a 77kg 170lb internal tank helium is used as a pressurant with an elastomeric diaphragm assisting expulsion the spacecrafts on-orbit mass including fuel is over 470kg 1040lb on the jupiter flyby trajectory but would have been only 445kg 981lb for the backup direct flight option to pluto significantly had the backup option been taken this would have meant less fuel for later kuiper belt operations there are 16 thrusters on new horizons four 44n 10lbf and twelve 09n 02lbf plumbed into redundant branches the larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections and the small ones previously used on cassini and the voyager spacecraft are used primarily for attitude control and spinupspindown maneuvers two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude they are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode in between the time of star camera readings spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundant miniature inertial measurement units each unit contains three solid-state gyroscopes and three accelerometers two adcole sun sensors provide attitude determination one detects the angle to the sun whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking power a cylindrical radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle the rtg provided 70022457000000000002457w of power at launch and was predicted to drop approximately 700035000000000000035w every year decaying to 7002202000000000000202w by the time of its encounter with the plutonian system in 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s there are no onboard batteries since rtg output is predictable and load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers as of january 2019 the power output of the rtg is about 7002190000000000000190w the rtg model gphs-rtg was originally a spare from the cassini mission the rtg contains 975kg 215lb of plutonium-238 oxide pellets each pellet is clad in iridium then encased in a graphite shell it was developed by the us department of energy at the materials and fuels complex a part of the idaho national laboratory the original rtg design called for 109kg 24lb of plutonium but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the united states department of energy including security activities that delayed plutonium production the mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage still not all instruments can operate simultaneously the department of energy transferred the space battery program from ohio to argonne in 2002 because of security concerns the amount of radioactive plutonium in the rtg is about one-third the amount on board the cassinihuygens probe when it launched in 1997 that cassini launch was protested by some the united states department of energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350 and monitored the launch as it always does when rtgs are involved it was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80 the average annual dosage in north america from background radiation over an area with a radius of 105km 65mi flight computer the spacecraft carries two computer systems the command and data handling system and the guidance and control processor each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy for a total of four computers the processor used for its flight computers is the mongoose-v a 12 mhz radiation-hardened version of the mips r3000 cpu multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime to conserve heat and mass spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in iems integrated electronics modules there are two redundant iems including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics each iem contains 9boards the software of the probe runs on nucleus rtos operating system there have been two safing events that sent the spacecraft into safe mode on march 19 2007 the command and data handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode the craft fully recovered within two days with some data loss on jupiters magnetotail no impact on the subsequent mission was expected on july 4 2015 there was a cpu safing event caused by over-assignment of commanded science operations on the crafts approach to pluto fortunately the craft was able to recover within two days without major impacts on its mission telecommunications and data handling communication with the spacecraft is via x band the craft had a communication rate of 700438000000000000038kbits at jupiter at plutos distance a rate of approximately 70031000000000000001kbits per transmitter was expected besides the low data rate plutos distance also causes a latency of about 45hours one-way the 70m 230ft nasa deep space network dsn dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond jupiter the spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers and either right- or left-hand circular polarization the downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers twtas mounted on the body under the dish the receivers are new low-power designs the system can be controlled to power both twtas at the same time and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the dsn that nearly doubles the downlink rate dsn tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful and the capability is now considered operational when the spacecraft power budget permits both twtas to be powered in addition to the high-gain antenna there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish the high-gain dish has a cassegrain reflector layout composite construction of 21-meter 7ft diameter providing over 700142000000000000042dbi of gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree the prime-focus medium-gain antenna with a 03-meter 1ft aperture and 10 half-power beam width is mounted to the back of the high-gain antennas secondary reflector the forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna the aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft this antenna was used only for early mission phases near earth just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control new horizons recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter then transmitted the data to earth data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders one primary one backup holding up to 70008000000000000008gigabytes each because of the extreme distance from pluto and the kuiper belt only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved this is because new horizons would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of pluto to transmit the buffer load back to earth at plutos distance radio signals from the space probe back to earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 47billion km of space part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the new horizons instrumentation is body-mounted in order for the cameras to record data the entire probe must turn and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward earth previous spacecraft such as the voyager program probes had a rotatable instrumentation platform a scan platform that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with earth new horizons was mechanically simplified to save weight shorten the schedule and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime the voyager 2 scan platform jammed at saturn and the demands of long time exposures at outer planets led to a change of plans such that the entire probe was rotated to make photos at uranus and neptune similar to how new horizons rotated science payload new horizons carries seven instruments three optical instruments two plasma instruments a dust sensor and a radio science receiverradiometer the instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology surface composition surface temperature atmospheric pressure atmospheric temperature and escape rate of pluto and its moons the rated power is 700121000000000000021watts though not all instruments operate simultaneously in addition new horizons has an ultrastable oscillator subsystem which may be used to study and test the pioneer anomaly towards the end of the spacecrafts life long-range reconnaissance imager lorri the long-range reconnaissance imager lorri is a long-focal-length imager designed for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths the instrument is equipped with a 10241024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic ccd imager giving a resolution of 5rad 1arcsec the ccd is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft this temperature differential requires insulation and isolation from the rest of the structure the 2083mm 820in aperture ritcheychretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide to boost stiffness reduce weight and prevent warping at low temperatures the optical elements sit in a composite light shield and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation overall mass is 86kg 19lb with the optical tube assembly ota weighing about 56kg 12lb for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time now surpassed by herschel for viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel lorri images are converted to 8-bit per pixel jpeg images these public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw lorri images files solar wind around pluto swap solar wind around pluto swap is a toroidal electrostatic analyzer and retarding potential analyzer rpa that makes up one of the two instruments comprising new horizons plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite pam the other being pepssi swap measures particles of up to 65kev and because of the tenuous solar wind at plutos distance the instrument is designed with the largest aperture of any such instrument ever flown pluto energetic particle spectrometer science investigation pepssi pluto energetic particle spectrometer science investigation pepssi is a time of flight ion and electron sensor that makes up one of the two instruments comprising new horizons plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite pam the other being swap unlike swap which measures particles of up to 65kev pepssi goes up to 1mev alice alice is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that is one of two photographic instruments comprising new horizons pluto exploration remote sensing investigation persi the other being the ralph telescope it resolves 1024wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet from 506993180000000000000180nm over 32view fields its goal is to determine the composition of plutos atmosphere this alice instrument is derived from another alice aboard esas rosetta spacecraft in august 2018 nasa confirmed based on results by alice on the new horizons spacecraft a hydrogen wall at the outer edges of the solar system that was first detected in 1992 by the two voyager spacecraft ralph telescope the ralph telescope 75 mm in aperture is one of two photographic instruments that make up new horizons pluto exploration remote sensing investigation persi with the other being the alice instrument ralph has two separate channels mvic multispectral visible imaging camera a visible-light ccd imager with broadband and color channels and leisa linear etalon imaging spectral array a near-infrared imaging spectrometer leisa is derived from a similar instrument on the earth observing-1 spacecraft ralph was named after alices husband on the honeymooners and was designed after alice on june 23 2017 nasa announced that it has renamed the leisa instrument to the lisa hardaway infrared mapping spectrometer in honor of lisa hardaway the ralph program manager at ball aerospace who died in january 2017 at age 50 venetia burney student dust counter vbsdc the venetia burney student dust counter vbsdc built by students at the university of colorado boulder is operating periodically to make dust measurements it consists of a detector panel about 460mm 300mm 18in 12in mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft the ram direction and an electronics box within the spacecraft the detector contains fourteen polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf panels twelve science and two reference which generate voltage when impacted effective collecting area is 0125m 135sqft no dust counter has operated past the orbit of uranus models of dust in the outer solar system especially the kuiper belt are speculative the vbsdc is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles in the range of nano- and picograms as they collide with the pvdf panels mounted on the new horizons spacecraft the measured data is expected to greatly contribute to the understanding of the dust spectra of the solar system the dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars giving new clues as to where earth-like planets can be found in the universe the dust counter is named for venetia burney who first suggested the name pluto at the age of 11 a thirteen-minute short film about the vbsdc garnered an emmy award for student achievement in 2006 radio science experiment rex the radio science experiment rex used an ultrastable crystal oscillator essentially a calibrated crystal in a miniature oven and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels these are small enough to fit on a single card because there are two redundant communications subsystems there are two identical rex circuit boards journey to pluto launch on september 24 2005 the spacecraft arrived at the kennedy space center on board a c-17 globemaster iii for launch preparations the launch of new horizons was originally scheduled for january 11 2006 but was initially delayed until january 17 2006 to allow for borescope inspections of the atlas vs kerosene tank further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditions downrange and high winds and technical difficultiesunrelated to the rocket itselfprevented launch for a further two days the probe finally lifted off from pad 41 at cape canaveral air force station florida directly south of space shuttle launch complex 39 at 1900utc on january 19 2006 the centaur second stage ignited at 190443utc and burned for 5 minutes 25 seconds it reignited at 1932utc and burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds the atk star 48b third stage ignited at 194237utc and burned for 1 minute 28 seconds combined these burns successfully sent the probe on a solar-escape trajectory at 1626 kilometers per second 58536kmh 36373mph new horizons took only nine hours to pass the moons orbit although there were backup launch opportunities in february 2006 and february 2007 only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the jupiter flyby any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to pluto delaying its encounter by five to six years the probe was launched by a lockheed martin atlas v 551 rocket with a third stage added to increase the heliocentric escape speed this was the first launch of the atlas v 551 configuration which uses five solid rocket boosters and the first atlas v with a third stage previous flights had used zero two or three solid boosters but never five the vehicle av-010 weighed 573160 kilograms 1263600lb at lift-off and had earlier been slightly damaged when hurricane wilma swept across florida on october 24 2005 one of the solid rocket boosters was hit by a door the booster was replaced with an identical unit rather than inspecting and requalifying the original the launch was dedicated to the memory of launch conductor daniel sarokon who was described by space program officials as one of the most influential people in the history of space travel inner solar system trajectory corrections on january 28 and 30 2006 mission controllers guided the probe through its first trajectory-correction maneuver tcm which was divided into two parts tcm-1a and tcm-1b the total velocity change of these two corrections was about 18 meters per second 65kmh 40mph tcm-1 was accurate enough to permit the cancellation of tcm-2 the second of three originally scheduled corrections on march 9 2006 controllers performed tcm-3 the last of three scheduled course corrections the engines burned for 76seconds adjusting the spacecrafts velocity by about 116ms 42kmh 26mph further trajectory maneuvers were not needed until september 25 2007 seven months after the jupiter flyby when the engines were fired for 15minutes and 37seconds changing the spacecrafts velocity by 237ms 85kmh 53mph followed by another tcm almost three years later on june 30 2010 that lasted 356seconds when new horizons had already reached the halfway point in time traveled to pluto in-flight tests and crossing of mars orbit during the week of february 20 2006 controllers conducted initial in-flight tests of three onboard science instruments the alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer the pepssi plasma-sensor and the lorri long-range visible-spectrum camera no scientific measurements or images were taken but instrument electronics and in the case of alice some electromechanical systems were shown to be functioning correctly on april 7 2006 the spacecraft passed the orbit of mars moving at roughly 21kms 76000kmh 47000mph away from the sun at a solar distance of 243 million kilometers asteroid 132524 apl because of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with kuiper belt objects subsequent to the pluto flyby intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned after launch the new horizons team scanned the spacecrafts trajectory to determine if any asteroids would by chance be close enough for observation in may 2006 it was discovered that new horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 apl on june 13 2006 closest approach occurred at 405utc at a distance of 101867km 63297mi the asteroid was imaged by ralph use of lorri was not possible because of proximity to the sun which gave the team a chance to test ralphs capabilities and make observations of the asteroids composition as well as light and phase curves the asteroid was estimated to be 25km 16mi in diameter the spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over june 1012 2006 first pluto sighting the first images of pluto from new horizons were acquired september 2124 2006 during a test of lorri they were released on november 28 2006 the images taken from a distance of approximately 42billionkm 26billionmi 28au confirmed the spacecrafts ability to track distant targets critical for maneuvering toward pluto and other kuiper belt objects jupiter encounter new horizons used lorri to take its first photographs of jupiter on september 4 2006 from a distance of 291million kilometers 181million miles more detailed exploration of the system began in january 2007 with an infrared image of the moon callisto as well as several black-and-white images of jupiter itself new horizons received a gravity assist from jupiter with its closest approach at 054340utc on february 28 2007 when it was 23million kilometers 14million miles from jupiter the flyby increased new horizons speed by 4kms 14000kmh 9000mph accelerating the probe to a velocity of 23kms 83000kmh 51000mph relative to the sun and shortening its voyage to pluto by three years the flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from january to june being an ever-changing scientific target jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the galileo mission in september 2003 knowledge about jupiter benefited from the fact that new horizons instruments were built using the latest technology especially in the area of cameras representing a significant improvement over galileos cameras which were modified versions of voyager cameras which in turn were modified mariner cameras the jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the pluto encounter because jupiter is much closer to earth than pluto the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer thus the mission returned more data from the jovian system than it was expected to transmit from pluto one of the main goals during the jupiter encounter was observing its atmospheric conditions and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and waves that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured the little red spot spanning up to 70 of earths diameter was imaged from up close for the first time recording from different angles and illumination conditions new horizons took detailed images of jupiters faint ring system discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena the search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results travelling through jupiters magnetosphere new horizons collected valuable particle readings bubbles of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon io were noticed in the magnetotail jovian moons the four largest moons of jupiter were in poor positions for observation the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant that new horizons passed millions of kilometers from any of the galilean moons still its instruments were intended for small dim targets so they were scientifically useful on large distant moons emphasis was put on jupiters innermost galilean moon io whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into jupiters magnetosphere and further out of eleven observed eruptions three were seen for the first time that of tvashtar reached an altitude of up to 330km 210mi the event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed callistos surface was analyzed with leisa revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice minor moons such as amalthea had their orbit solutions refined the cameras determined their positions acting as reverse optical navigation outer solar system after passing jupiter new horizons spent most of its journey towards pluto in hibernation mode redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle decrease operation costs and free the deep space network for other missions during hibernation mode the onboard computer monitored the probes systems and transmitted a signal back to earth a green code if everything was functioning as expected or a red code if mission controls assistance was needed the probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked the first hibernation mode cycle started on june 28 2007 the second cycle began on december 16 2008 the third cycle on august 27 2009 and the fourth cycle on august 29 2014 after a 10-week test new horizons crossed the orbit of saturn on june 8 2008 and uranus on march 18 2011 after astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the pluto system kerberos and styx mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons a study based on 18 months of computer simulations earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 03 on the probes scheduled course if the hazard increased new horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans the so-called shbots safe haven by other trajectories the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3000km from the surface of pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris while in hibernation mode in july 2012 new horizons started gathering scientific data with swap pepssi and vbsdc although it was originally planned to activate just the vbsdc other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator alan stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data before activating the other two instruments ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby the first set of data was transmitted in january 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation the command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets possible neptune trojan targets other possible targets were neptune trojans the probes trajectory to pluto passed near neptunes trailing lagrange point l5 which may host hundreds of bodies in 11 resonance in late 2013 new horizons passed within 12au 180000000km 110000000mi of the high-inclination l5 neptune trojan 2011 hm102 which was identified shortly before by the new horizons kbo search survey team while searching for more distant objects for new horizons to fly by after its 2015 pluto encounter at that range 2011 hm102 would have been bright enough to be detectable by new horizons lorri instrument however the new horizons team eventually decided that they would not target 2011 hm102 for observations because the preparations for the pluto approach took precedence observations of pluto and charon 201314 images from july 1 to 3 2013 by lorri were the first by the probe to resolve pluto and charon as separate objects on july 14 2014 mission controllers performed a sixth trajectory-correction maneuver tcm since its launch to enable the craft to reach pluto between july 1924 2014 new horizons lorri snapped 12 images of charon revolving around pluto covering almost one full rotation at distances ranging from about 429 to 422million kilometers 267000000 to 262000000mi in august 2014 astronomers made high-precision measurements of plutos location and orbit around the sun using the atacama large millimetersubmillimeter array alma to help nasas new horizons spacecraft accurately home in on pluto on december 6 2014 mission controllers sent a signal for the craft to wake up from its final pluto-approach hibernation and begin regular operations the crafts response that it was awake arrived to earth on december 7 2014 at 0230utc pluto approach distant-encounter operations at pluto began on january 4 2015 at this date images of the targets with the onboard lorri imager plus the ralph telescope would only be a few pixels in width investigators began taking pluto and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory of new horizons to aim the approach on january 15 2015 nasa gave a brief update of the timeline of the approach and departure phases on february 12 2015 nasa released new images of pluto taken from january 25 to 31 from the approaching probe new horizons was more than 203million kilometers 126000000mi away from pluto when it began taking the photos which showed pluto and its largest moon charon the exposure time was too short to see plutos smaller much fainter moons investigators compiled a series of images of the moons nix and hydra taken from january 27 through february 8 2015 beginning at a range of 201million kilometers 125000000mi pluto and charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center the right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield the yet smaller two moons kerberos and styx were seen on photos taken on april 25 starting may 11 a hazard search was performed by looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft such as rings or more moons which were possible to avoid by a course change also in regards to the approach phase during january 2015 on august 21 2012 the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the kuiper belt object temporarily designated vnh0004 now designated 2011 kw48 when the object was at a distance from new horizons of 75 gigameters 050au the object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from earth namely a phase curve and a search for small moons a second object was planned to be observed in june 2015 and a third in september after the flyby the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018 on april 15 2015 pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap software glitch on july 4 2015 new horizons experienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem on july 5 nasa announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on july 7 the science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the missions main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives the timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneouslycompressing previously acquired data to release space for more data and making a second copy of the approach command sequencethat together overloaded the spacecrafts primary computer after the overload was detected the spacecraft performed as designed it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer entered safe mode and sent a distress call back to earth the distress call was received the afternoon of july 4 which alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue the resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter pluto system encounter the closest approach of the new horizons spacecraft to pluto occurred at 1149utc on july 14 2015 at a range of 12472km 7750mi from the surface and 13658km 8487mi from the center of pluto telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft were received on earth from the vicinity of the pluto system on july 15 2015 005237utc after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being pointed toward the pluto system mission managers estimated a one in 10000 chance that debris could have destroyed it during the flyby preventing it from sending data to earth the first details of the encounter were received the next day but the download of the complete data set through the 2 kbps data downlink took just over 15 months and analysis of the data will take longer objectives the missions science objectives are grouped in three distinct priorities the primary objectives were required the secondary objectives were expected to be met but were not demanded the tertiary objectives were desired these objectives could have been skipped in favor of the above objectives an objective to measure any magnetic field of pluto was dropped a magnetometer instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable mass budget and schedule and swap and pepssi could do an indirect job detecting some magnetic field around pluto primary objectives required characterize the global geology and morphology of pluto and charon map chemical compositions of pluto and charon surfaces characterize the

parameters radii masses and orbits of pluto and charon search for additional moons and any rings the new horizons flyby of the pluto system was fully successful meeting and in many cases exceeding the pluto objectives set out for it by nasa and the national academy of sciences flyby details new horizons passed within 12500km 7800mi of pluto with this closest approach on july 14 2015 at 1150utc new horizons had a relative velocity of 1378kms 49600kmh 30800mph at its closest approach and came as close as 28800km 17900mi to charon starting 32 days before the closest approach long-range imaging included the mapping of pluto and charon to 40km 25mi resolution this is half the rotation period of the plutocharon system and allowed imaging of all sides of both bodies close range imaging was repeated twice per day in order to search for surface changes caused by localized snow fall or surface cryovolcanism because of plutos tilt a portion of the northern hemisphere would be in shadow at all times during the flyby engineers expected lorri to be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as 50m per pixel 160ftpx if closest distance were around 12500km and mvic was expected to obtain four-color global dayside maps at 16km 1mi resolution lorri and mvic attempted to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs leisa obtained hyperspectral near-infrared maps at 7kmpx 43mipx globally and 06kmpx 037mipx for selected areas meanwhile alice characterized the atmosphere both by emissions of atmospheric molecules airglow and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind pluto occultation during and after closest approach swap and pepssi sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind vbsdc searched for dust inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings rex performed active and passive radio science the communications dish on earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind pluto the results resolved plutos diameter by their timing and atmospheric density and composition by their weakening and strengthening pattern alice can perform similar occultations using sunlight instead of radio beacons previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere to earth downlink plutos mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft as the spacecraft speeds up and slows down the radio signal exhibited a doppler shift the doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics reflected sunlight from charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside backlighting by the sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes rex performed radiometry of the nightside satellite observations new horizons best spatial resolution of the small satellites is 330m per pixel 1080ftpx at nix 780mpx 2560ftpx at hydra and approximately 18kmpx 11mipx at kerberos and styx estimates for the diameters of these bodies are nix at 544136km 342522mi hydra at 4333km 2721mi kerberos at 1245km 7528mi and styx at 75km 4331mi this translates to a resolution of 164124109 5542 73 and 43 pixels in width for nix hydra kerberos and styx respectively initial predictions envisioned kerberos as a relatively large and massive object whose dark surface led to it having a faint reflection this proved to be wrong as images obtained by new horizons on july 14 and sent back to earth in october 2015 revealed an object just 8km 50mi across with a highly reflective surface suggesting the presence of relatively clean water ice post-pluto events soon after the pluto flyby in july 2015 new horizons reported that the spacecraft was healthy its flight path was within the margins and science data of the plutocharon system had been recorded the spacecrafts immediate task was to begin returning the 625 gigabytes of information collected the free-space path loss at its distance of 45 light-hours 3000000000km is approximately 303 db at 7ghz using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power the signal from eirp is 83 dbm and at this distance the signal reaching earth is 220 dbm the received signal level rsl using one un-arrayed deep space network antenna with 72 dbi of forward gain equals 148 dbm because of the extremely low rsl it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kilobits per second by march 30 2016 new horizons had reached the halfway point of transmitting this data the transfer was completed on october 25 2016 at 2148utc when the last piece of datapart of a plutocharon observation sequence by the ralphleisa imagerwas received by the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory at a distance of 43au 643billionkm 400billionmi from the sun and 04au 60millionkm 37millionmi from 2014 mu69 as of november 2018 new horizons is heading in the direction of the constellation sagittarius at 1410kms 876mis 297aua relative to the sun the brightness of the sun from the spacecraft is magnitude 185 mission extension the new horizons team requested and received a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional kuiper belt objects kbos funding was secured on july 1 2016 during this kuiper belt extended mission kem the spacecraft has performed a close fly-by of 486958 2014 mu69 and will conduct more distant observations on an additional two dozen objects and possibly make a fly-by of another kbo kuiper belt object mission target background mission planners searched for one or more additional kuiper belt objects kbos of the order of 50100km 3162mi in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecrafts plutonian encounter however despite the large population of kbos many factors limited the number of possible targets because the flight path was determined by the pluto flyby and the probe only had 33 kilograms of hydrazine propellant remaining the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degrees width extending from pluto the target also needed to be within 55au because beyond 55au the communications link will become too weak and the rtg power output will have decayed significantly enough to hinder observations desirable kbos would be well over 50km 30mi in diameter neutral in color to contrast with the reddish pluto and if possible have a moon that imparts a wobble search in 2011 mission scientists started a dedicated search for suitable kbos using ground telescopes large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras notably the twin 65-meter magellan telescopes in chile the 82-meter subaru observatory in hawaii and the canadafrancehawaii telescope were used to search for potential targets by participating in a citizen-science project called ice hunters the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates the ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 kbos of potential interest but none of these were close enough to the flight path of new horizons only the hubble space telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful kbo mission on june 16 2014 time on hubble was granted for a search hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable kbos than ground telescopes the probability that a target for new horizons would be found was estimated beforehand at about 95 suitable kbos on october 15 2014 it was revealed that hubbles search had uncovered three potential targets temporarily designated pt1 potential target 1 pt2 and pt3 by the new horizons team all are objects with estimated diameters in the 3055km 1934mi range and were too small to be seen by ground telescopes each were at distances from the sun of ranging from 43 to 44 au which would put the encounters in the 20182019 period the initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within new horizons fuel budget are 100 7 and 97 respectively all are members of the cold low-inclination low-eccentricity classical kuiper belt and thus are very different from pluto pt1 given the temporary designation 1110113y on the hst web site the most favorably situated object has a magnitude of 268 is 3045km 1928mi in diameter and was encountered in january 2019 a course change to reach it required about 35 of new horizons available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply a mission to pt3 was in some ways preferable in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than pt1 but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events once sufficient orbital information was provided the minor planet center gave provisional designations to the three target kbos 2014 mu69 pt1 2014 os393 pt2 and 2014 pn70 pt3 by the fall of 2014 a possible fourth target 2014 mt69 had been eliminated by follow-up observations pt2 was out of the running before the pluto flyby the spacecraft will also study almost 20 kbos from afar kbo selection on august 28 2015 486958 2014 mu69 pt1 was chosen as the flyby target the necessary course adjustment was performed with four engine firings between october 22 and november 4 2015 the flyby occurred on january 1 2019 at 0033 utc observations of other kbos aside from its flyby of 486958 2014 mu69 the extended mission for new horizons calls for the spacecraft to conduct observations of and look for ring systems around between 25 and 35 different kbos in addition it will continue to study the gas dust and plasma composition of the kuiper belt before the mission extension ends in 2021 on november 2 2015 new horizons imaged kbo 15810 arawn with the lorri instrument from 280millionkm away 170millionmi 19au showing the shape of the object and one or two details this kbo was again imaged by the lorri instrument on april 78 2016 from a distance of 111millionkm 69millionmi 074au the new images allowed the science team to further refine the location of 15810 arawn to within 1000km 620mi and to determine its rotational period of 547 hours in july 2016 the lorri camera captured some distant images of quaoar from 21billionkm away 13billionmi 14au the oblique view will complement earth-based observations to study the objects light-scattering properties on december 5 2017 when new horizons was 409au from earth a calibration image of the wishing well cluster marked the most distant image from earth ever taken by a spacecraft breaking the 27-year record set by voyager 1s famous pale blue dot two hours later new horizons surpassed its own record imaging the kuiper belt objects 2012 hz84 and 2012 he85 from a distance of 050 and 034au respectively these are the closest images taken of a kuiper belt object besides pluto and 2014 mu69 as of february2018 encounter with 486958 2014 mu69 objectives science objectives of the flyby included characterizing the geology and morphology of 2014 mu69 nicknamed ultima thule and mapping the surface composition by searching for ammonia carbon monoxide methane and water ice searches will be conducted for orbiting moonlets a coma rings and the surrounding environment additional objectives include mapping the surface geology to learn how it formed and evolved measuring the surface temperature mapping the 3-d surface topography and surface composition to learn how it is similar to and different from comets such as 67pchuryumovgerasimenko and dwarf planets such as pluto searching for any signs of activity such as a cloud-like coma searching for and studying any satellites or rings measuring or constraining the mass targeting maneuvers 2014 mu69 is the first object to be targeted for a flyby that was discovered after the spacecraft was launched new horizons is planned to come within 3500km 2200mi of 2014 mu69 three times closer than the spacecrafts earlier encounter with pluto images with a resolution of up to 30m 98ft per pixel are expected the new mission began on october 22 2015 when new horizons carried out the first in a series of four initial targeting maneuvers designed to send it toward 2014 mu69 the maneuver which started at approximately 1950utc and used two of the spacecrafts small hydrazine-fueled thrusters lasted approximately 16 minutes and changed the spacecrafts trajectory by about 10 meters per second 33fts the remaining three targeting maneuvers took place on october 25 october 28 and november 4 2015 approach phase the craft was brought out of its hibernation at approximately 0033utc scet on june 5 2018 0612utc ert earth-received time in order to prepare for the approach phase after verifying its health status the spacecraft transitioned from a spin-stabilized mode to a three-axis-stabilized mode on august 13 2018 the official approach phase began on august 16 2018 and continued through december 24 2018 the first distant images from new horizons were acquired starting in early september 2018 new horizons made its first detection of 2014 mu69 on august 16 2018 from a distance of 107millionmi 172millionkm at that time 2014 mu69 was visible at magnitude 20 against a crowded stellar background in the direction of the constellation sagittarius core phase the core phase began a week before the encounter and continued for two days after the encounter the spacecraft flew by the object at a speed of 51500kmh 32000mph 143kms and within 3500km 2200mi the majority of the science data was collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the inner core closest approach occurred january 1 2019 at 0533utc scet at which point it was 7012649254758838000434au from the sun at this distance the one-way transit time for radio signals between earth and new horizons was six hours confirmation that the craft had succeeded in filling its digital recorders with data only arrived on earth ten hours later at 1529 utc data download after the encounter preliminary high-priority data was sent to earth on january 1 and 2 2019 on january 9 new horizons returned to a spin-stabilized mode to prepare to send the remainder of its data back to earth this download is expected to take 20 months at a data rate of 12 kilobits per second post 2014 mu69 encounter events after the spacecrafts passage by 2014 mu69 the instrument continues to have sufficient power to be operational until the 2030s team leader alan stern stated the potential for a third flyby in the 2020s at the outer edges of the kuiper belt this depends on a suitable kuiper belt object still to be found or confirmed close enough to the spacecrafts current trajectory in addition new horizons may take a picture of earth from its distance in the kuiper belt but only after completing all planned kbo flybys this is because pointing a camera towards earth risks it being damaged by sunlight speed new horizons has been called the fastest spacecraft ever launched because it left earth at 1626 kilometers per second 58536kmh 36373mph faster than any other spacecraft it is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory which requires an approximate speed while near earth of 165kms 59000kmh 37000mph plus additional delta-v to cover air and gravity drag all to be provided by the launch vehicle however it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the solar system as of january2018 this record is held by voyager 1 traveling at 16985kms 61146kmh 37994mph relative to the sun voyager 1 attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity than new horizons thanks to gravity assists by jupiter and saturn when new horizons reaches the distance of 7013149597870700000100au it will be travelling at about 13kms 47000kmh 29000mph around 4kms 14000kmh 8900mph slower than voyager 1 at that distance the parker solar probe can also be measured as the fastest object because of its orbital speed relative to the sun at perihelion 953kms 343000kmh 213000mph because it remains in solar orbit its specific orbital energy relative to the sun is lower than new horizons and other artificial objects escaping the solar system new horizons star 48b third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the solar system and reached jupiter before the new horizons spacecraft it was expected to cross plutos orbit on october 15 2015 because it is not in controlled flight it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within 200millionkm 120millionmi of pluto the centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit gallery images of the launch videos timeline preparation phase january 8 2001
