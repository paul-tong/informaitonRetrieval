nasa spinoff technologies are commercial products and services which have been developed with the help of nasa through research and development contracts such as small business innovation research sbir or sttr awards licensing of nasa patents use of nasa facilities technical assistance from nasa personnel or data from nasa research information on new nasa technology that may be useful to industry is available in periodical and website form in nasa tech briefs while successful examples of commercialization are reported annually in the nasa publication spinoffs in 1979 notable science fiction author robert a heinlein helped bring awareness to the spinoffs when he was asked to appear before congress after recovering from one of the earliest known vascular bypass operations to correct a blocked artery in his testimony reprinted in the book expanded universe he claimed that four nasa spinoff technologies made the surgery possible and it was a few from a long list of nasa spinoff technologies from space development for more than 50 years the nasa technology transfer program has connected nasa resources to private industry referring to the commercial products as spinoffs well-known products that nasa claims as spinoffs include memory foam originally named temper foam freeze-dried food firefighting equipment emergency space blankets dustbusters cochlear implants lzr racer swimsuits and cmos image sensors as of 2016 nasa claims that there are nearly 2000 other spinoffs in the fields of computer technology environment and agriculture health and medicine public safety transportation recreation and industrial productivity contrary to common belief nasa did not invent tang velcro or teflon in 2008 nasa announced an interactive web feature nasa home and city which uses flash animation to show some examples of everyday products claimed to be spinoffs history of the spinoff publication spinoff is a nasa publication featuring technology made available to the public since 1976 nasa has featured an average of 50 technologies each year in the annual publication and spinoff maintains a searchable database of these technologies when products first spun off from space research nasa presented a black and white report in 1973 titled the technology utilization program report because of interest in the reports nasa decided to create the annual publications in color spinoff was first published in 1976 and since then nasa has distributed free copies to universities the media inventors and the general public spinoff describes how nasa works with various industries and small businesses to bring new technology to the public as of 2016 there were over 1920 spinoff products in the database dating back to 1976 health and medicine infrared ear thermometers diatek corporation and nasa developed an aural thermometer that measures the thermal radiation emitted by the eardrum similar to the way the temperature of stars and planets are measured this method avoids contact with mucous membranes and permits rapid temperature measurement of newborn or incapacitated patients nasa supported the diatek corporation through the technology affiliates program ventricular assist device collaboration between nasa dr michael debakey dr george noon and micromed technology inc resulted in a heart pump for patients awaiting heart transplants the micromed debakey ventricular assist device vad functions as a bridge to heart transplant by pumping blood until a donor heart is available the pump is approximately one-tenth the size of other currently marketed pulsatile vads because of the pumps small size fewer patients developed device-related infections it can operate up to 8 hours on batteries giving patients the mobility to do normal everyday activities lasik lasik technology comes from the 1980s efforts for autonomous rendezvous and docking of space vehicles to service satellites eventually a range and velocity imaging ladar was demonstrated that could be used for docking spacecraft ladar was also used in military and nasa-sponsored research for applications in strategic target tracking and weapons firing control this technology is used by eye surgeons to track eye movements at a rate of 4000 times per second while reshaping the cornea the clear front surface of the eye using a laser artificial limbs nasas continued funding coupled with its collective innovations in robotics and shock-absorptioncomfort materials are inspiring and enabling the private sector to create new and better solutions for animal and human prostheses advancements such as environmental robots incs development of artificial muscle systems with robotic sensing and actuation capabilities for use in nasa space robotic and extravehicular activities are being adapted in order to create more functionally dynamic artificial limbs additionally other private-sector adaptations of nasas temper foam technology have brought about custom-moldable materials offering the natural look and feel of flesh as well as preventing friction between the skin and the prosthesis and heatmoisture buildup light-emitting diodes in medical therapies after initial experiments using light-emitting diodes in nasa space shuttle plant growth experiments nasa issued a small business innovation grant that led to the development of a hand-held high-intensity led unit developed by quantum devices inc that can be used to treat tumors after other treatment options are depleted this therapy was approved by the fda and inducted into the space foundations space technology hall of fame in 2000 invisible braces invisible braces are a type of transparent ceramics called translucent polycrystalline alumina tpa a company known as ceradyne developed tpa in conjunction with nasa advanced ceramics research as protection for infrared antennae on heat-seeking missile trackers scratch-resistant lenses a sunglasses manufacturer called foster grant first licensed a nasa technology for scratch-resistant lenses developed for protecting space equipment from scratching in space especially helmet visors space blanket so-called space blankets developed in 1964 for the space program are lightweight and reflect infrared radiation these items are often included in first aid kits 3d foods printing beehex developed 3d food printing systems for pizza and later desserts and icings following an sbir grant that began as a nasa-funded project transportation aircraft anti-icing systems nasa funding under the sbir program and work with nasa scientists advanced the development of a thermoelectric deicing system called thermawing a dc-powered air conditioner for single-engine aircraft called thermacool and high-output alternators to run them both thermawing allows pilots to safely fly through ice encounters and provides pilots of single-engine aircraft the heated wing technology usually reserved for larger jet-powered craft thermacool an electric air conditioning system uses a new compressor whose rotary pump design runs off an energy-efficient brushless dc motor and allows pilots to use the air conditioner before the engine starts highway safety safety grooving the cutting of grooves in concrete to increase traction and prevent injury was first developed to reduce aircraft accidents on wet runways represented by the international grooving and grinding association the industry expanded into highway and pedestrian applications safety grooving originated at langley research center which assisted in testing the grooving at airports and on highways skidding was reduced stopping distance decreased and a vehicles cornering ability on curves was increased the process has been extended to animal holding pens parking lots and other potentially slippery surfaces improved radial tires goodyear tire and rubber company developed a fibrous material five times stronger than steel for nasa to use in parachute shrouds to soft-land the viking lander spacecraft on the martian surface recognizing the durability of the material goodyear expanded the technology and went on to produce a new radial tire with a tread life expected to be 10000 miles 16000km greater than conventional radials chemical detection nasa contracted with intelligent optical systems ios to develop moisture- and ph-sensitive sensors to warn of corrosive conditions in aircraft before damage occurs this sensor changes color in response to contact with its target after completing the work with nasa ios was tasked by the us department of defense to further develop the sensors for detecting chemical warfare agents and potential threats such as toxic industrial compounds and nerve agents ios has sold the chemically sensitive fiber optic cables to major automotive and aerospace companies who are finding a variety of uses for the devices such as aiding experimentation with nontraditional power sources and as an economical alarm system for detecting chemical release in large facilities public safety video enhancing and analysis systems intergraph government solutions developed its video analyst system vas by building on video image stabilization and registration visar technology created by nasa to help fbi agents analyze video footage originally used for enhancing video images from nighttime videotapes made with hand-held camcorders vas is a tool for video enhancement and analysis offering support of full-resolution digital video stabilization frame-by-frame analysis conversion of analog video to digital storage formats and increased visibility of filmed subjects without altering underlying footage aside from law enforcement and security applications vas has also been adapted to serve the military for reconnaissance weapons deployment damage assessment training and mission debriefing landmine removal thiokol has used surplus rocket fuel through an agreement with nasas marshall space flight center used the fuel to produce a flare that can safely destroy landmines the fuel that is left unused from a launch will become a solid which cannot be reused but can be used as an ingredient needed to create the demining device flare the demining device flare uses a battery-triggered electric match to ignite and neutralize land mines in the field without detonation the flare uses the solid rocket fuel to burn a hole in a mines case and burns away the explosive contents so the mine can be disarmed without hazard fire-resistant reinforcement built and designed by avco corporation the apollo heat shield was coated with a material whose purpose was to burn and thus dissipate energy during reentry while charring to form a protective coating to block heat penetration nasa subsequently funded avcos development of other applications of the heat shield such as fire-retardant paints and foams for aircraft which led to an intumescent epoxy material which expands in volume when exposed to heat or flames acting as an insulating barrier and dissipating heat through burn-off further innovations include steel coatings devised to make high-rise buildings and public structures safer by swelling to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel for up to 4 hours of fire protection ultimately to slow building collapse and provide more time for escape firefighting equipment firefighting equipment in the united states is based on lightweight materials developed for the us space program nasa and the national bureau of standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask frame harness and air bottle using an aluminum composite material developed by nasa for use on rocket casings the broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus for protection from smoke inhalation injury additionally nasas inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost more rugged short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters nasa also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 ounces 85g to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head as well as flexible heat-resistant materialsdeveloped to protect the space shuttle on reentrywhich are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters shock absorbers for buildings with nasa funding taylor devices inc developed shock absorbers that could safely remove the fuel and electrical connectors from the space shuttles during launch these absorbers are being used as seismic shock absorbers to protect buildings from earthquakes in places like tokyo and san francisco consumer home and recreation temper foam as the result of a program designed to develop a padding concept to improve crash protection for airplane passengers ames research center developed what is now called memory foam memory foam or temper foam has been incorporated into mattresses pillows military and civilian aircraft automobiles and motorcycles sports safety equipment amusement park rides and arenas horseback saddles archery targets furniture and human and animal prostheses its high-energy absorption and soft characteristics offer protection and comfort temper foam was inducted into the space foundation space technology hall of fame in 1998 enriched baby food commercially available infant formulas now contain a nutritional enrichment ingredient that traces its existence to nasa-sponsored research on bread mold as a recycling agent for long-duration space travel the substance formulated into the products lifesdha and lifesara and based on microalgae can be found in over 90 of the infant formulas sold in the united states and are added to infant formulas in over 65 other countries martek biosciences corporations founders and principal scientists acquired their expertise in this area while working on the nasa program the microalgae food supplement was inducted into the space foundation space technology hall of fame in 2009 portable cordless vacuums for the apollo space mission nasa required a portable self-contained drill capable of extracting core samples from below the lunar surface black decker was tasked with the job and developed a computer program to optimize the design of the drills motor and ensure minimal power consumption that computer program led to the development of a cordless miniature vacuum cleaner called the dustbuster freeze drying in planning for the long-duration apollo missions nasa conducted extensive research into space food one of the techniques developed in 1938 by nestl was freeze drying in the united states action products later commercialized this technique for other foods concentrating on snack food resulting in products like space ice cream the foods are cooked quickly frozen and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process the final product retains 98 of its nutrition and weighs much less than before drying the ratio of weight before and after drying depends strongly on the particular food item but a typical freeze-dried weight is 20 of the original weight today one of the benefits of this advancement in food preservation includes simple nutritious meals available to disabled and otherwise homebound senior adults unable to take advantage of existing meal programs space age swimsuit langley research centers wind tunnel testing facilities and fluid flow analysis software supported speedos design of a space age-enriched swimsuit the resulting lzr racer reduced skin friction drag 24 more than the previous speedo swimsuit in march 2008 athletes wearing the lzr racer broke 13 swimming world records digital image sensor the invention of digital image sensors used in products like mobile phones and gopro cameras traces back to nasa jpl scientist eric fossum who wanted to miniaturize cameras for interplanetary missions fossum invented cmos image sensors that have become nasas most ubiquitous spinoff technology enabling the use of cameras inside mobile phones fossum found a way to reduce the signal noise that had plagued earlier attempts at cmos imagers applying a technique called intra-pixel charge transfer with correlated double sampling that results in a clearer image this led to the creation of cmos active pixel sensors which are used today in all smartphone cameras and many other applications air-scrubbers based on a discovery made in the 1990s at the wisconsin center for space automation and robotics where researchers with the help of the space product development program at marshall space flight center were trying to find a way to eliminate ethylene that accumulates around plants growing in spacecraft and then found a solution light-induced oxidation when uv light hits titanium dioxide it frees electrons that turn oxygen and moisture into charged particles that oxidize air contaminants such as volatile organic compounds turning them into carbon dioxide and water this air scrubber also eliminates other airborne organic compounds and neutralized bacteria viruses and molds an air scrubber with light-induced oxidation can cleans air surfaces and clothes and nearly 30 major league baseball teams now have this scrubber technology in their facilities environmental and agricultural resources water purification nasa engineers are collaborating with qualified companies to develop systems intended to sustain the astronauts living on the international space station and future moon and space missions this system turns wastewater from respiration sweat and urine into drinkable water by combining the benefits of chemical adsorption ion exchange and ultra-filtration processes this technology can yield safe drinkable water from the most challenging sources such as in underdeveloped regions where well water may be heavily contaminated solar cells single-crystal silicon solar cells are now widely available at low cost the technology behind these solar deviceswhich provide up to 50 more power than conventional solar cellsoriginated with the efforts of a nasa-sponsored 28-member coalition forming the environmental research aircraft and sensor technology erast alliance erasts goal was to develop remotely piloted aircraft intended to fly unmanned at high altitudes for days at a time and requiring advanced solar power sources that did not add weight as a result sunpower corporation created advanced silicon-based cells for terrestrial or airborne applications pollution remediation nasas microencapsulating technology enabled the creation of a petroleum remediation product which safely cleans petroleum-based pollutants from water the prp uses thousands of microcapsulestiny balls of beeswax with hollow centers water cannot penetrate the microcapsules cell but oil is absorbed into the beeswax spheres as they float on the waters surface contaminating chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil such as fuels motor oils or petroleum hydrocarbons are caught before they settle limiting damage to ocean beds correcting for gps signal errors in the 1990s nasa scientists at jpl developed software capable of correcting for gps signal errors enabling accuracy within inchescentimetres it is called real-time gipsy rtg john deere licensed the software and used it to develop self-driving farm equipment as of 2016 as nearly 70 of north american farmland is cultivated by self-driving tractors which rely on rtg that was developed at nasa water location dr alain gachet founded radar technologies international rti in 1999 to use satellite generated data to identify probable locations of precious metals and during its use found it could also detect water the system developed with this data watex uses about 80 percent of its data inputs from publicly available nasa information this free information allowed rti to develop the watex system to successfully locate water sources such as in 2004 at refugee camps during the war in darfur computer technology structural analysis software nasa software engineers have created thousands of computer programs over the decades equipped to design test and analyze stress vibration and acoustical properties of a broad assortment of aerospace parts and structures the nasa structural analysis program or nastran is considered one of the most successful and widely used nasa software programs it has been used to design everything from cadillacs to roller coaster rides originally created for spacecraft design it has been employed in a host of non-aerospace applications and is available to industry through nasas computer software management and information center cosmic cosmic maintains a library of computer programs from nasa and other government agencies and sells them at a fraction of the cost of developing a new program nasa structural analysis computer software was inducted into the space foundation space technology hall of fame in 1988 remotely controlled ovens embedded web technology ewt softwareoriginally developed by nasa for use by astronauts operating experiments on the international space stationlets a user monitor andor control a device remotely over the internet nasa supplied this technology and guidance to tmio llc which developed remote control and monitoring of a new intelligent oven product named connect io with combined cooling and heating capabilities connect io refrigerates food until a customized pre-programmable cooking cycle begins the menu allows the user to simply enter the dinner time and the oven automatically switches from refrigeration to the cooking cycle so that the meal will be ready as the family arrives home for dinner nasa visualization explorer on july 26 2011 nasa released the nasa visualization explorer app for the ipad the application delivers real-time satellite data including movies and stills of earth that enable users to learn about subjects such as climate change earths dynamic systems and plant life on land and in the oceans the content is accompanied by short descriptions about the data and why it is important openstack nasa developed a cloud compute platform to give additional compute and storage resources for its engineers called nebula in july 2010 the nebula code was released as open source and nasa partnered with rackspace to form the openstack project openstack is used in the cloud-based products from many companies in the cloud market software catalog nasa released a software catalog in 2014 that made over 1600 pieces of software available to the public at no charge industrial productivity powdered lubricants nasa developed a solid lubricant coating ps300 which is deposited by thermal spraying to protect foil air bearings ps300 lowers friction reduces emissions and has been used by nasa in advanced aeropropulsion engines refrigeration compressors turbochargers and hybrid electrical turbogenerators adma products has found widespread industrial applications for the material improved mine safety an ultrasonic bolt elongation monitor developed by a nasa scientist for testing tension and high-pressure loads on bolts and fasteners has continued to evolve over the past three decades today the same scientist and luna innovations are using a digital adaptation of this same device for non-destructive evaluation nde of railroad ties groundwater analysis radiation and as a medical testing device to assess levels of internal swelling and pressure for patients suffering from intracranial pressure and compartment syndrome a painful condition that results when pressure within muscles builds to dangerous levels food safety faced with the problem of how and what to feed an astronaut in a sealed capsule under weightless conditions while planning for human spaceflight nasa enlisted the aid of the pillsbury company to address two principal concerns eliminating crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecrafts atmosphere and sensitive instruments and assuring absolute absence of disease-producing bacteria and toxins pillsbury developed the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp concept to address nasas second concern haccp is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred the us food and drug administration has applied haccp guidelines for the handling of seafood juice and dairy products for space missions gold is particularly useful because it is good at reflecting light which will help to detect celestial objects from far away and gold does not oxidize so it will not tarnish unlike most other metals due to both benefits the james webb space telescope uses a lot of gold for its mirrors nasa partnered with epner technology a brooklyn-based business that has been gold-plating for generations to develop the technology to gold plate the telescopes parts this nasa technology transfer to epner gave the company a reputation for durable gold coatings and the academy of motion picture arts and sciences was having to replate oscar statues that had faded over time epner has contracted with the academy to gold plate all future oscars while offering a lifetime guarantee to replate for free any faded oscar its gold plating has lasted for decades in space without fading mistakenly attributed nasa spinoffs the following is a list of technologies sometimes mistakenly attributed directly to nasa in many cases nasa popularized technology or aided its development due to its usefulness in space which ultimately resulted in the technologys creation barcodes - the barcode was invented in 1948 however nasa developed a type of barcode that could endure in space environments cordless power tools - the first cordless power tool was unveiled by black decker in 1961 these were used by nasa and a number of spinoff products came out of those projects such as portable cordless vacuums magnetic resonance imaging mri best known as a device for body scanning nasa contractor jpl developed digital signal processing which has applications in medical imaging used by mris microchip - the first microchip also known as an integrated circuit was developed in 1958 by texas instruments quartz clocks - the first quartz clock was invented in 1927 however in the late 1960s nasa partnered with a company to make a highly accurate quartz clock smoke detectors - nasas connection to the modern smoke detector is that it developed one with adjustable sensitivity as part of the skylab project this development helps with nuisance tripping space pen - an urban legend states that nasa spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in space the result purportedly being the fisher space pen while the soviets used pencils while nasa did spend funds to create a pen to work in space the project was cancelled due to public opposition and us astronauts used pencils until the fisher space pen was invented by a third party tang juice powder - tang was developed by general foods in 1957 tang was used in multiple early space missions which gave brand awareness to it teflon - teflon was invented by a dupont scientist in 1941 and used on frying pans from the 1950s however it has been applied by nasa to heat shields space suits and cargo hold liners velcro - velcro is a swiss invention from the 1940s velcro was used during the apollo missions to anchor equipment for astronauts it is still used for convenience in zero gravity situations see also
