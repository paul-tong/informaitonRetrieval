blue origin llc is an american privately funded aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight services company headquartered in kent washington founded in 2000 by jeff bezos the company is developing technologies to enable private human access to space with the goal to dramatically lower costs and increase reliability blue origin is employing an incremental approach from suborbital to orbital flight with each developmental step building on its prior work the company motto is gradatim ferociter latin for step by step ferociously blue origin is developing a variety of technologies with a focus on rocket-powered vertical takeoff and vertical landing vtvl vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital space the companys name refers to the blue planet earth as the point of origin initially focused on suborbital spaceflight the company has designed built and flown multiple testbeds of its new shepard spacecraft at its facilities in culberson county texas developmental test flights of the new shepard named after the first american in space alan shepard began in april 2015 and flight testing continued into 2018 with its first passenger-carrying spaceflight planned for 2019 on nearly every one of the test flights since 2015 the uncrewed vehicle has reached a test altitude of more than 100km 330000ft and achieved a top speed of more than mach3 3675kmh 2284mph reaching space above the krmn line with both the space capsule and its rocket booster successfully soft landing making reuse possible by 2016 the second new shepard booster test article had made four flights each time exceeding 100km 330000ft in altitude before returning for successful soft landings blue origin has become a part of a dramatic metamorphosis of the space industry in recent years having moved into the orbital spaceflight technology business in 2014 initially as a rocket engine supplier for others via a contractual agreement to build a new large rocket engine the be-4 for major us launch system operator united launch alliance ula ula is also considering the be-3 blue origins smaller rocket engine used on new shepard for use in a new second stagethe advanced cryogenic evolved stage aceswhich will become the primary upper stage for ulas vulcan orbital launch vehicle in the 2020s by 2015 blue origin had announced plans to also manufacture and fly its own orbital launch vehicle from the florida space coast known as the new glenn be-4 had been expected to complete engine qualification testing by late 2018 but the test program continued into 2019 history blue origin founder jeff bezos had been interested in space from an early age a profile published in 2013 described a 1982 miami herald interview bezos gave after he was named valedictorian of his high school class the 18-year-old bezos said he wanted to build space hotels amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit the whole idea is to preserve the earth he told the newspaper the goal was to be able to evacuate humans the planet would become a park in 1999 after watching the rocketry biopic film october sky bezos discussed with science-fiction author neal stephenson the idea of forming a space company blue origin was founded in 2000 in kent washington and began developing both rocket propulsion systems and launch vehicles since the founding the company was very secretive about its plans and emerged from its self-imposed silence only after 2015 while the company was formally incorporated in 2000 its existence became public only in 2003 when bezos began buying land in texas and interested parties followed up on the purchases this was a topic of some interest in local politics and bezos rapid aggregation of lots under a variety of whimsically named shell companies was called a land grab from 2003 to 2017 blue origin was led by its president rob meyerson now senior vice president meyerson leads the advanced development program business in july 2013 the company employed approximately 250 people by may 2015 they had grown to approximately 400 employees with 350 of those working on engineering manufacturing and business operations in the kent location and approximately 50 in texas supporting the engine-test and suborbital test-flight facility by april 2017 the company had more than 1000 employees in august 2018 the company was more than 1500 employees more than double the number in early 2016 and is expected to double again by the time new glenn is flying as of 2016 blue origin was spending us1 billion a year funded by jeff bezos sales of amazon stock in both 2017 and again in 2018 bezos made public statements that he intends to fund blue origin with us1 billion per year from sales of his equity in amazon new shepard as early as 2005 bezos had discussed plans to create a vertical-takeoff and landing spaceship called new shepard plans for new shepard were initially kept quiet but blue origins website indicated bezos desire to lower the cost of spaceflight so that we humans can better continue exploring the solar system by 2008 a publicized timetable for new shepard indicated that blue origin intended to fly unmanned in 2011 and manned in 2012 in a 2011 interview bezos indicated that he founded blue origin to send customers into space by focusing on two objectives to decrease the cost and to increase the safety of human spaceflight by july 2014 bezos had invested over us500 million of his own money into blue origin the first developmental test flight of the new shepard occurred on april 29 2015 the uncrewed vehicle flew to its planned test altitude of more than 935km 307000ft and achieved a top speed of mach3 3675kmh 2284mph in july 2015 nanoracks a provider of services such as payload design and development safety approvals and integration announced a partnership with blue origin to provide standardized payload accommodations for experiments flying on blue origins new shepard suborbital vehicle as of late 2016 blue origin projected that if all test flights operate as scheduled they could begin flying passengers to space on the new shepard in 2018 in september 2014 the company and united launch alliance ula entered into a partnership whereby blue origin would produce a large rocket enginethe be-4for the vulcan the successor to the 1000019000-kilogram-class 2200042000lb atlas v which has launched us national security payloads since the early 2000s and will exit service in the late 2010s the 2014 announcement added that blue origin had been working on the engine for three years prior to the public announcement and that the first flight on the new rocket could occur as early as 2019 by april 2017 development and test of the 2400kn 550000lbf be-4 were progressing well and blue origin was expected to be selected for the ula vulcan rocket in april 2015 blue origin announced that it had completed acceptance testing of the be-3 rocket engine that would power the new shepard space capsule to be used for blue origin suborbital flights on november 23 2015 blue origin launched the new shepard rocket to space for a second time to an altitude of 10053km 329839ft and vertically landed the rocket booster less than 15 metres 5ft from the center of the pad the capsule descended to the ground under parachutes 11 minutes after blasting off and landed safely this was the first time a suborbital booster had flown to space and returned to earth this flight validated the vehicle architecture and design the ring fin shifted the center of pressure aft to help control reentry and descent eight large drag brakes deployed and reduced the vehicles terminal speed to 623kmh 387mph hydraulically actuated fins steered the vehicle through 192kmh 119mph high-altitude crosswinds to a location precisely aligned with and 1500m 5000ft above the landing pad then the highly throttleable be-3 engine re-ignited to slow the booster as the landing gear deployed and the vehicle descended the last 30m 100ft at 71kmh 44mph to touchdown on the pad on january 22 2016 blue origin re-flew the same new shepard booster that launched and landed vertically in november 2015 demonstrating reuse this time new shepard reached an apogee of 1017km 333582ft before both capsule and booster returned to earth for recovery and reuse on april 2 2016 the same new shepard booster again flew now for a third time reaching 1034km 339178ft before again returning successfully in september 2015 blue origin announced details of an unnamed planned orbital launch vehicle indicating that the first stage would be powered by its be-4 rocket engine currently under development while the second stage would be powered by its recently completed be-3 rocket engine in addition blue origin announced that it would both manufacture and launch the new rocket from the florida space coast no payload or gross launch weight was given bezos noted in interviews that this new launch vehicle would not compete for us government national security missions leaving that market to united launch alliance and spacex science-fiction author neal stephenson worked part-time at blue origin into late 2006 and credited the companys employees for ideas and discussions leading to his 2015 novel seveneves in march 2016 blue origin invited journalists to see the inside of its kent washington headquarters and manufacturing facility for the first time the company is planning for substantial growth in 2016 as it builds more crew capsules and propulsion modules for the new shepard program and ramps up be-4 engine builds to support full-scale development testing employment is expected to grow to 1000 in 2016 from 600 in february bezos also articulated a long-term vision for humans in space seeing the potential to move much heavy industry completely off-earth leaving our planet zoned strictly for residential and light industrial use with an end state hundreds of years out where millions of people would be living and working in space by march 2016 manned test flights were planned to take place by 2017 with possible commercial service in 2018 also in march 2016 bezos discussed his plans to offer space tourism services to space pointing out the entertainment aspect of the early barnstormers in really advancing aviation in the early days when such rides were a big fraction of airplane flights in those early days he sees space tourism playing a similar role advancing space travel and rocket launches through tourism and entertainment on the other hand there are no current plans to pursue the niche market of us military launches bezos has said he is unsure where blue origin would add any value in that market in june 2018 blue origin indicated that while it continued to plan to fly initial internal passengers later in 2018 it would not be selling commercial tickets for new shepard until 2019 new glenn on september 12 2016 blue announced that its orbital rocket would be named new glenn in honor of the first american astronaut to orbit the earth john glenn and that the 7-meter-diameter 23ft first stage will be powered by seven blue origin be-4 engines the first stage is reusable and will land vertically just like the new shepard suborbital launch vehicle that preceded it at the time of the announcement of new glenn bezos revealed that the next project beyond new glenn would be new armstrong without detailing what that would be in march 2017 bezos announced that blue origin had acquired its first paying launch customer for orbital satellite launches eutelsat is expected to start launching tv satellites in 2022 on blue origins new glenn orbital launch vehicle a day after announcing eutelsat blue origin introduced oneweb as its second customer in september 2017 blue origin closed a deal for new glenn with its first asian customer mu space the company based in thailand plans to provide satellite-based broadband services and space travel in asia-pacific on december 12 2017 blue origin launched technology that could treat chest trauma in a space environment facilities blue origin has a development facility near seattle washington and an operational launch facility in west texas where they also test rocket engines blue origin has continued to expand its seattle-area office and rocket production facilities in 2016purchasing an adjacent 11000m 120000sqft-buildingand 2017 with permits filed to build a new 21900m 236000sqft warehouse complex and an additional 9560m 102900sqft of office space blue origin manufactures rocket engines launch vehicles and space capsules in washington its largest engine be-4 will be produced at a new manufacturing facility in alabama in 2017 blue origin established a manufacturing facility for launch vehicles in florida near where they will launch new glenn from the cape canaveral air force station after initiating design and construction in 2015 launch vehicles early low-altitude flight test platforms charon blue origins first flight test vehicle called charon after plutos moon was powered by four vertically mounted rolls-royce viper mk 301 jet engines rather than rockets the low-altitude vehicle was developed to test autonomous guidance and control technologies and the processes that the company would use to develop its later rockets charon made its only test flight at moses lake washington on march 5 2005 it flew to an altitude of 96m 316ft before returning for a controlled landing near the liftoff point charon is currently on display at the museum of flight in seattle washington goddard the next test vehicle named the goddard also known as pm1 first flew on november 13 2006 the flight was successful a test flight for december 2 never launched according to federal aviation administration records two further flights were performed by goddard new shepard suborbital system blue origins new shepard suborbital spaceflight system is composed of two vehicles a crew capsule accommodating three or more astronauts launched by a rocket booster the two vehicles lift off together and are designed to separate during flight after separation the booster is designed to return to earth to perform a vertical landing while the crew capsule follows a separate trajectory returning under parachutes for a land touchdown both vehicles are intended for recovery and re-use new shepard is controlled entirely by on-board computers in addition to flying astronauts new shepard is intended to provide frequent opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into suborbital space a federal aviation administration notam indicated that a flight test of an early suborbital test vehicle pm2 was scheduled for august 24 2011 the flight in west texas failed when ground personnel lost contact and control of the vehicle blue origin released its analysis of the failure on september 2 as the vehicle reached a speed of mach12 14701kmh 9134mph and 14km 46000ft altitude a flight instability drove an angle of attack that triggered the range safety system to terminate thrust on the vehicle on october 19 2012 blue origin conducted a successful new shepard pad escape test at its west texas launch site firing its pusher escape motor and launching a full-scale crew capsule from a launch vehicle simulator the crew capsule traveled to an altitude of 703m 2307ft under active thrust vector control before descending safely by parachute to a soft landing 500m 1630ft downrange in april 2015 blue origin announced its intent to begin autonomous test flights of new shepard in 2015 as frequently as monthly blue origin expected a series of dozens of flights over the extent of the test program taking a couple of years to complete on april 29 2015 new shepard made its first test flight the uncrewed vehicle flew to its planned test altitude of more than 935km 307000ft and achieved a top speed of mach3 3675kmh 2284mph the crew capsule separated from the booster before returning to earth for a landing under parachutes on november 23 2015 new shepard made its second test flight reaching 1005km 330000ft altitude with successful recovery of both crew capsule and booster the booster successfully performed a powered vertical landing on january 22 2016 blue origin re-flew the same new shepard booster that launched and landed vertically in november 2015 demonstrating reuse this time new shepard reached an apogee of 1017km 333582ft before both capsule and booster returned to earth for recovery and reuse on april 2 2016 the same new shepard booster flew for a third time reaching 1034km 339178ft before returning successfully on june 19 2016 the same new shepard booster again flew now for a fourth time again reaching over 1006km 330000ft before again returning successfully a fifth and final test flight of the second booster and test capsule took place in october 2016 the first flight of the third booster took place in december 2017 new glenn orbital launch vehicle the new glenn is a 7-metre 23ft-diameter two stage orbital launch vehicle that is expected to launch prior to 2020 the design work on the vehicle began in 2012 the high-level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in september 2016 the first stage will be powered by seven be-4 engines also designed and manufactured by blue origin the first stage is reusable just like the new shepard suborbital launch vehicle that preceded it the second stage is intended to be expendable orbital launch vehicle revealed in 2015 the blue origin orbital launch vehiclewhich began to be referred to by the placeholder name of very big brother in march 2016 is a two-stage-to-orbit liquid-propellant rocket the launcher is intended to be reusable in january 2016 blue origin announced that they plan to announce details about the launch vehicle later in 2016 and a few details were released in march 2016 when blue origin indicated that the first orbital launch was expected from the florida launch facility in 2020 the first stage is to be powered by blue origins be-4 single-shaft oxygen-rich staged combustion liquid methaneliquid oxygen rocket engine while the second stage will be powered by the recently qualified be-3 tap-off cycle liquid hydrogenliquid oxygen rocket engine the number of engines powering each stage has not been released nor has the payload or gross launch weight specifications no details were publicly released as of september 2015 blue origin intends to launch the rocket from the historic launch complex 36 and manufacture the rockets at a new facility on nearby land in exploration park acceptance testing of the be-4 engines will also be done in florida orbital subsystems and earlier development work blue origin began developing systems for orbital human spacecraft prior to 2012 a reusable first-stage booster was projected to fly a suborbital trajectory taking off vertically like the booster stage of a conventional multistage rocket following stage separation the upper stage would continue to propel astronauts to orbit while the first-stage booster would descend to perform a powered vertical landing similar to the new shepard suborbital propulsion module the first-stage booster would be refueled and launched again allowing improved reliability and lowering the cost of human access to space the booster rocket was projected to loft blue origins biconic space vehicle to orbit carrying astronauts and supplies after orbiting the earth the space vehicle will reenter earths atmosphere to land on land under parachutes and then be reused on future missions to earth orbit blue origin successfully completed a system requirements review srr of its orbital space vehicle in may 2012 engine testing for the reusable booster system rbs vehicle began in 2012 a full-power test of the thrust chamber for blue origin be-3 liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen rocket engine was conducted at a nasa test facility in october 2012 the chamber successfully achieved full thrust of 100000 pounds-force about 440kn test flights rocket engine development be-1 blue engine 1 or be-1 was the first rocket engine developed by blue origin and was used on the companys goddard development vehicle the pressure-fed monopropellant engine was powered by peroxide and produced 98kn 2200lbf of thrust be-2 blue engine 2 or be-2 was a pump-fed bipropellant engine burning kerosene and peroxide which produced 140kn 31000lbf of thrust five be-2 engines powered blue origins pm-2 development vehicle on two test flights in 2011 be-3 blue origin publicly announced the development of the blue engine 3 or be-3 in january 2013 but the engine had begun development in the early 2010s be-3 is a new liquid hydrogenliquid oxygen lh2lox cryogenic engine that can produce 490kn 110000lbf of thrust at full power and can be throttled down to as low as 110kn 25000lbf for use in controlled vertical landings early thrust chamber testing began at nasa stennis in 2013 by late 2013 the be-3 had been successfully tested on a full-duration suborbital burn with simulated coast phases and engine relights demonstrating deep throttle full power long-duration and reliable restart all in a single-test sequence nasa has released a video of the test as of december2013 the engine had demonstrated more than 160 starts and 9100 seconds 25h of operation at blue origins test facility near van horn texas be-3 engine acceptance testing was completed by april 2015 with 450 test firings of the engine and a cumulative run time of more than 30000 seconds 83h the be-3 engine powers the new shepard space capsule that is being used for blue origin suborbital flights that began in 2015 be-3u the be-3u engine is a modified be-3 for use on upper stages of blue origin orbital launch vehicles the engine will include a nozzle better optimized for operation under vacuum conditions as well as a number of other manufacturing differences since it is an expendable engine whereas the be-3 is designed for reusability be-4 blue origin began work on a new and much larger rocket engine in 2011 the new engine the blue engine 4 or be-4 is a change for blue origin in that it is their first engine that will combust liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants the engine has been designed to produce 2400kn 550000lbf of thrust and was initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle blue origin did not announce the new engine to the public until september 2014 in late 2014 blue origin signed an agreement with united launch alliance ula to co-develop the be-4 engine and to commit to use the new engine on an upgraded atlas v launch vehicle replacing the single rd-180 russian-made engine the new launch vehicle will use two of the 2400kn 550000lbf be-4 engines on each first stage the engine development program began in 2011 when announced in 2014 and still in march 2016 ula expected the first flight of the new launch vehiclethe vulcanno earlier than 2019 as of march 2018 blue intends to complete engine qualification testing by late 2018 but no date for the first launch event has been recently stated by ula pusher escape motor blue origin partnered with aerojet rocketdyne to develop a pusher launch escape system for the new shepard suborbital crew capsule aerojet rocketdyne provides the crew capsule escape solid rocket motor cce srm while the thrust vector control system that steers the capsule during an abort is designed and manufactured by blue origin in late 2012 blue origin performed a pad abort test of the escape system on a full-scale suborbital capsule four years later in 2016 the escape system was successfully tested in-flight at the point of highest dynamic pressure as the vehicle reached transonic velocity funding by july 2014 jeff bezos had invested over us500 million into blue origin even by march 2016 the vast majority of funding to support technology development and operations at blue origin has come from jeff bezos private investment but bezos had declined to publicly state the amount prior to 2017 when an annual amount was stated publicly blue origin has also completed work for nasa on several small development contracts receiving total funding of us257 million by 2013 as of april2017 bezos is selling approximately us1 billion in amazon stock each year to privately finance blue origin collaborations with nasa blue origin has contracted to do work for nasa on several development efforts the company was awarded us37 million in funding in 2009 by nasa via a space act agreement under the first commercial crew development ccdev program for development of concepts and technologies to support future human spaceflight operations nasa co-funded risk-mitigation activities related to ground testing of 1 an innovative pusher escape system that lowers cost by being reusable and enhances safety by avoiding the jettison event of a traditional tractor launch escape system and 2 an innovative composite pressure vessel cabin that both reduces weight and increases safety of astronauts this was later revealed to be a part of a larger system designed for a biconic capsule that would be launched atop an atlas v rocket on november 8 2010 it was announced that blue origin had completed all milestones under its ccdev space act agreement in april 2011 blue origin received a commitment from nasa for us22 million of funding under the ccdev phase 2 program milestones included 1 performing a mission concept review mcr and system requirements review srr on the orbital space vehicle which utilizes a biconic shape to optimize its launch profile and atmospheric reentry 2 further maturing the pusher escape system including ground and flight tests and 3 accelerating development of its be-3 loxlh2 440kn 100000lbf engine through full-scale thrust chamber testing in 2012 nasas commercial crew program released its follow-on ccicap solicitation for the development of crew delivery to iss by 2017 blue origin did not submit a proposal for ccicap but is reportedly continuing work on its development program with private funding blue origin had earlier attempted to lease a different part of the space coast when they submitted a bid in 2013 to lease launch complex 39a lc39a at the kennedy space centeron land to the north of and adjacent to cape canaveral afsfollowing nasas decision to lease the unused complex out as part of a bid to reduce annual operation and maintenance costs the blue origin bid was for shared and non-exclusive use of the lc39a complex such that the launchpad was to have been able to interface with multiple vehicles and costs for using the launch pad were to have been shared across multiple companies over the term of the lease one potential shared user in the blue origin notional plan was united launch alliance a competing bid for commercial use of the lc39a launch complex was submitted by spacex which submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex to support their crewed missions in september 2013before completion of the bid period and before any public announcement by nasa of the results of the processblue origin filed a protest with the us general accounting office gao over what it says is a plan by nasa to award an exclusive commercial lease to spacex for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39a nasa had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by october 1 2013 but the protest will delay any decision until the gao reaches a decision expected by mid-december spacex said that they would be willing to support a multi-user arrangement for pad 39a in december 2013 the gao denied the blue origin protest and sided with nasa which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as either multi-use or single-use the solicitation document merely asked bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility in the event nasa selected the spacex proposal in late 2013 and signed a 20-year lease contract for launch pad 39a to spacex in april 2014 with darpa blue origin cooperated with boeing in phase 1 of the darpa xs-1 spaceplane program united launch alliance in september 2018 it was announced that blue origins be-4 engine was selected by united launch alliance to provide first-stage rocket engines for their latest booster design the vulcan rocket the be-4 engine is set to replace the russian-build rd-180
