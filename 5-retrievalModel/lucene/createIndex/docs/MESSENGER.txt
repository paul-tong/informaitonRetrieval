messenger stylized as messenger a backronym for mercury surface space environment geochemistry and ranging the name is a reference to the messenger deity of the same name from roman mythology was a nasa robotic spacecraft that orbited the planet mercury between 2011 and 2015 the probe was launched aboard a delta ii rocket in august 2004 to study mercurys chemical composition geology and magnetic field the instruments carried by messenger were used on a complex series of flybys the spacecraft flew by earth once venus twice and mercury itself three times allowing it to decelerate relative to mercury using minimal fuel during its first flyby of mercury in january 2008 messenger became the second mission after mariner 10s 1975 flyby to reach mercury messenger entered orbit around mercury on march 18 2011 becoming the first spacecraft to do so it successfully completed its primary mission in 2012 following two mission extensions the messenger spacecraft used the last of its maneuvering propellant and deorbited as planned impacting the surface of mercury on april 30 2015 mission overview messengers formal data collection mission began on april 4 2011 the primary mission was completed on march 17 2012 having collected close to 100000 images messenger achieved 100 mapping of mercury on march 6 2013 and completed its first year-long extended mission on march 17 2013 messengers second extended mission lasted for over two years but as its low orbit degraded it required reboosts to avoid impact it conducted its final reboost burns on october 24 2014 and january 21 2015 before crashing into mercury on april 30 2015 during its stay in mercury orbit messengers instruments yielded significant data including a characterization of mercurys magnetic field and the discovery of water ice at the planets north pole which had long been suspected on the basis of earth-based radar data mission background previous missions in 1973 mariner 10 was launched by nasa to make multiple flyby encounters of venus and mercury mariner 10 provided the first detailed data of mercury mapping 4045 of the surface mariner 10s final flyby of mercury occurred on march 16 1975 no subsequent close-range observations of the planet would take place for more than 30 years proposals for the mission in 1998 a study detailed a proposed mission to send an orbiting spacecraft to mercury as the planet was at that point the least-explored of the inner planets in the years following the mariner 10 mission subsequent mission proposals to revisit mercury had appeared too costly requiring large quantities of propellant and a heavy lift launch vehicle moreover inserting a spacecraft into orbit around mercury is difficult because a probe approaching on a direct path from earth would be accelerated by the suns gravity and pass mercury far too quickly to orbit it however using a trajectory designed by chen-wan yen in 1985 the study showed it was possible to seek a discovery-class mission by using multiple consecutive gravity assist swingby maneuvers around venus and mercury in combination with minor propulsive trajectory corrections to gradually slow the spacecraft and thereby minimize propellant needs objectives the messenger mission was designed to study the characteristics and environment of mercury from orbit specifically the scientific objectives of the mission were to characterize the chemical composition of mercurys surface to study the planets geologic history to elucidate the nature of the global magnetic field magnetosphere to determine the size and state of the core to determine the volatile inventory at the poles to study the nature of mercurys exosphere spacecraft design the messenger spacecraft was designed and built at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory science operations were managed by sean solomon as principal investigator and mission operations were also conducted at jhuapl the messenger bus measured 185 meters 73in tall 142m 56in wide and 127m 50in deep the bus was primarily constructed with four graphite fiber cyanate ester composite panels that supported the propellant tanks the large velocity adjust lva thruster attitude monitors and correction thrusters the antennas the instrument pallet and a large ceramic-cloth sunshade measuring 25m 82ft tall and 2m 66ft wide for passive thermal control at launch the spacecraft weighed approximately 1100 kilograms 2400lb with its full load of propellant messengers total mission cost including the cost of the spacecrafts construction was estimated at under us450 million attitude control and propulsion main propulsion was provided by the 645n 317 secisp bipropellant hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide large velocity assist lva thruster the model used was the leros 1b developed and manufactured at ampacisps westcott works in the united kingdom the spacecraft was designed to carry 6078 kilograms 1340lb of propellant and helium pressurizer for the lva four 22n 49lbf monopropellant thrusters provided spacecraft steering during main thruster burns and twelve 44n 10lbf monopropellant thrusters were used for attitude control for precision attitude control a reaction wheel attitude control system was also included information for attitude control was provided by star trackers an inertial measurement unit and six sun sensors communications the probe included two small deep space transponders for communications with the deep space network and three kinds of antennas a high gain phased array whose main beam could be electronically steered in one plane a medium-gain fan-beam antenna and a low gain horn with a broad pattern the high gain antenna was used as transmit-only at 84ghz the medium-gain and low gain antennas transmit at 84ghz and receive at 72ghz and all three antennas operate with right-hand circularly polarized rhcp radiation one of each of these antennas was mounted on the front of the probe facing the sun and one of each was mounted to the back of the probe facing away from the sun power the space probe was powered by a two-panel gallium arsenidegermanium solar array providing an average of 450 watts while in mercury orbit each panel was rotatable and included optical solar reflectors to balance the temperature of the array power was stored in a common-pressure-vessel 23-ampere-hour nickelhydrogen battery with 11 vessels and two cells per vessel computer and software the spacecrafts onboard computer system was contained in an integrated electronics module iem a device that combined core avionics into a single box the computer featured two radiation-hardened ibm rad6000s a 25megahertz main processor and a 10mhz fault protection processor for redundancy the spacecraft carried a pair of identical iems for data storage the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each the ibm rad6000 main processor collected compressed and stored data from messengers instruments for later playback to earth messenger used a software suite called scibox to simulate its orbit and instruments in order to choreograph the complicated process of maximizing the scientific return from the mission and minimizing conflicts between instrument observations while at the same time meeting all spacecraft constraints on pointing data downlink rates and onboard data storage capacity scientific

by nasa from space launch complex 17b at the cape canaveral air force station in florida aboard a delta ii 7925 launch vehicle the complete burn sequence lasted 57 minutes bringing the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit with a final velocity of 1068kms 664miless and sending the probe into a 79 billion-kilometer trajectory that took 6 years 7 months and 16 days before its orbital insertion on march 18 2011 traveling to mercury requires an extremely large velocity change see delta-v because mercurys orbit is deep in the suns gravity well on a direct course from earth to mercury a spacecraft is constantly accelerated as it falls toward the sun and will arrive at mercury with a velocity too high to achieve orbit without excessive use of fuel for planets with an atmosphere such as venus and mars spacecraft can minimize their fuel consumption upon arrival by using friction with the atmosphere to enter orbit aerocapture or can briefly fire their rocket engines to enter into orbit followed by a reduction of the orbit by aerobraking however the tenuous atmosphere of mercury is far too thin for these maneuvers instead messenger extensively used gravity assist maneuvers at earth venus and mercury to reduce the speed relative to mercury then used its large rocket engine to enter into an elliptical orbit around the planet the multi-flyby process greatly reduced the amount of propellant necessary to slow the spacecraft but at the cost of prolonging the trip by many years and to a total distance of 49 billion miles several planned thruster firings en route to mercury were unnecessary because these fine course adjustments were performed using solar radiation pressure acting on messengers solar panels to further minimize the amount of necessary propellant the spacecraft orbital insertion targeted a highly elliptical orbit around mercury the elongated orbit had two other benefits it allowed the spacecraft time to cool after the times it was between the hot surface of mercury and the sun and also it allowed the spacecraft to measure the effects of solar wind and the magnetic fields of the planet at various distances while still allowing close-up measurements and

524-second-long burn deep-space maneuver or dsm-1 of the large thruster adjusted the trajectory for the upcoming venus flyby during the earth flyby the messenger team imaged the earth and moon using mdis and checked the status of several other instruments observing the atmospheric and surface compositions and testing the magnetosphere and determining that all instruments tested were working as expected this calibration period was intended to ensure accurate interpretation of data when the spacecraft entered orbit around mercury ensuring that the instruments functioned correctly at such an early stage in the mission allowed opportunity for multiple minor errors to be dealt with the earth flyby was used to investigate the flyby anomaly where some spacecraft have been observed to have trajectories that differ slightly from those predicted however no anomaly was observed in messengers flyby a view of earth from messenger during its earth flyby a view of earth from messenger during

passed behind venus and entered superior conjunction a period when earth was on the exact opposite side of the solar system with the sun inhibiting radio contact for this reason no scientific observations were conducted during the flyby communication with the spacecraft was reestablished in late november and performed a deep space maneuver on december 12 to correct the trajectory to encounter venus in a second flyby on june 5 2007 at 2308 utc messenger performed a second flyby of venus at an altitude of 338km 210mi for the greatest velocity reduction of the mission during the encounter all instruments were used to observe venus and prepare for the following mercury encounters the encounter provided visible and near-infrared imaging data of the upper atmosphere of venus ultraviolet and x-ray spectrometry of the upper atmosphere were also recorded to characterize the composition the esas venus express was also orbiting during the encounter providing the first opportunity for simultaneous measurement of particle-and-field characteristics of the planet venus imaged by messenger on its first flyby of the planet in 2006 venus imaged by messenger on its first

approach of the last flyby the spacecraft entered safe mode although this had no effect on the trajectory necessary for later orbit insertion it resulted in the loss of science data and images that were planned for the outbound leg of the fly-by the spacecraft had fully recovered by about seven hours later one last deep space maneuver dsm-5 was executed on november 24 2009 at 2245 utc to provide

primary mission began as planned on april 4 2011 with messenger orbiting mercury once every twelve hours for an intended duration of twelve earth months the equivalent of two solar days on mercury principal investigator sean solomon then of the carnegie institution of washington said with the beginning today of the primary science phase of the mission we will be making nearly continuous observations that will allow us to gain the first global perspective on the innermost planet moreover as solar activity steadily increases we will have a front-row seat on the most dynamic magnetosphereatmosphere system in the solar system on october 5 2011 the scientific results obtained by messenger during its first six terrestrial months in mercurys orbit were presented in a series of papers at the european planetary science congress in nantes france among the discoveries presented were the unexpectedly high concentrations of magnesium and calcium found on mercurys nightside and
