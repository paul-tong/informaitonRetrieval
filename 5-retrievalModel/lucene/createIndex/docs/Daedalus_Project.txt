project daedalus was a study conducted between 1973 and 1978 by the british interplanetary society to design a plausible unmanned interstellar spacecraft intended mainly as a scientific probe the design criteria specified that the spacecraft had to use existing or near-future technology and had to be able to reach its destination within a human lifetime alan bond led a team of scientists and engineers who proposed using a fusion rocket to reach barnards star 59 light years away the trip was estimated to take 50 years but the design was required to be flexible enough that it could be sent to any other target star concept daedalus would be constructed in earth orbit and have an initial mass of 54000 tonnes including 50000 tonnes of fuel and 500 tonnes of scientific payload daedalus was to be a two-stage spacecraft the first stage would operate for two years taking the spacecraft to 71 of light speed 0071 c and then after it was jettisoned the second stage would fire for 18 years taking the spacecraft up to about 12 of light speed 012 c before being shut down for a 46-year cruise period due to the extreme temperature range of operation required from near absolute zero to 1600 k the engine bells and support structure would be made of molybdenum alloyed with titanium zirconium and carbon which retains strength even at cryogenic temperatures a major stimulus for the project was friedwardt winterbergs inertial confinement fusion drive concept for which he received the hermann oberth gold medal award this velocity is well beyond the capabilities of chemical rockets or even the type of nuclear pulse propulsion studied during project orion according to dr tony martin controlled-fusion engine and the nuclearelectric systems have very low thrust equipment to convert nuclear energy into electrical has a large mass which results in small acceleration which would take a century to achieve the desired speed thermodynamic nuclear engines of the nerva type require a great quantity of fuel photon rockets have to generate power at a rate of 310 w per kg of vehicle mass and require mirrors with absorptivity of less than 1 part in 10 interstellar ramjets problems are tenuous interstellar medium with a density of about 1 atomcm a large diameter funnel and high power required for its electric field thus the only suitable propulsion method for the project was the nuclear pulse rocket daedalus would be propelled by a fusion rocket using pellets of a deuteriumhelium-3 mix that would be ignited in the reaction chamber by inertial confinement using electron beams the electron beam system would be powered by a set of induction coils trapping energy from the plasma exhaust stream 250 pellets would be detonated per second and the resulting plasma would be directed by a magnetic nozzle the computed burn-up fraction for the fusion fuels was 0175 and 0133 producing exhaust velocities of 10600kms and 9210kms respectively due to scarcity of helium-3 on earth it was to be mined from the atmosphere of jupiter by large hot-air balloon supported robotic factories over a 20-year period or from a less distant source such as the moon the second stage would have two 5-metre optical telescopes and two 20-metre radio telescopes about 25 years after launch these telescopes would begin examining the area around barnards star to learn more about any accompanying planets this information would be sent back to earth using the 40-metre diameter second stage engine bell as a communications dish and targets of interest would be selected since the spacecraft would not decelerate upon reaching barnards star daedalus would carry 18 autonomous sub-probes that would be launched between 72 and 18 years before the main craft entered the target system these sub-probes would be propelled by nuclear-powered ion drives and would carry cameras spectrometers and other sensory equipment the sub-probes would fly past their targets still traveling at 12 of the speed of light and transmit their findings back to the daedalus second stage mothership for relay back to earth the ships payload bay containing its sub-probes telescopes and other equipment would be protected from the interstellar medium during transit by a beryllium disk up to 7mm thick weighing up to 50 tonnes this erosion shield would be made from beryllium due to its lightness and high latent heat of vaporisation larger obstacles that might be encountered while passing through the target system would be dispersed by an artificially generated cloud of particles ejected by support vehicles called dust bugs about 200km ahead of the vehicle the spacecraft would carry a number of robot wardens capable of autonomously repairing damage or malfunctions specifications overall length 190 metres payload mass 450 tonnes variants a quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating variation on project daedalus was published in 1980 by robert freitas the non-replicating design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication use the probe to deliver a seed factory with a mass of about 443 metric tons to a distant site have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself on-site to increase its total manufacturing capacity then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct probes with a seed factory on board over a 1000-year period each repro would weigh over 10 million tons due to the extra fuel needed to decelerate from 12 of lightspeed another possibility is to equip the daedalus with a magnetic sail similar to the magnetic scoop on a bussard ramjet to use the destination star heliosphere as a brake making carrying deceleration fuel unnecessary allowing a much more in-depth study of the star system chosen see also
