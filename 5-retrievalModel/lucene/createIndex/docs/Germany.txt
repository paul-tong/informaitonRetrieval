top tourism destinations in the world etymology the english word germany derives from the latin germania which came into use after julius caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the rhine the german term deutschland originally diutisciu land the german lands is derived from deutsch compare dutch descended from old high german diutisc popular ie belonging to the diot or diota people originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from latin and its romance descendants this in turn descends from proto-germanic iudiskaz popular see also the latinised form theodiscus derived from eud descended from proto-indo-european tewth- people from which the word teutons also originates history the discovery of the mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in germany at least 600000 years ago the oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in schningen where three 380000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed the neander valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered the new species of human was called the neanderthal the neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40000 years old evidence of modern humans similarly dated has been found in caves in the swabian jura near ulm the finds included 42000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found the 40000-year-old ice age lion man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered and the 35000-year-old venus of hohle fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered the nebra sky disk is a bronze artefact created during the european bronze age attributed to a site near nebra saxony-anhalt it is part of unescos memory of the world programme germanic tribes and frankish empire the germanic tribes are thought to date from the nordic bronze age or the pre-roman iron age from southern scandinavia and north germany they expanded south east and west from the 1st centurybc coming into contact with the celtic tribes of gaul as well as iranian baltic and slavic tribes in central and eastern europe under augustus rome began to invade germania an area extending roughly from the rhine to the ural mountains in 9ad three roman legions led by varus were defeated by the cheruscan leader arminius by 100ad when tacitus wrote germania germanic tribes had settled along the rhine and the danube the limes germanicus occupying most of the area of modern germany however austria baden wrttemberg southern bavaria southern hessen and the western rhineland had been conquered and incorporated into roman provinces noricum raetia germania superior and germania inferior in the 3rd century a number of large west germanic tribes emerged alemanni franks chatti saxons frisii sicambri and thuringii around 260 the germanic peoples broke into roman-controlled lands after the invasion of the huns in 375 and with the decline of rome from 395 germanic tribes moved farther southwest simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now germany and displaced or absorbed smaller germanic tribes large areas known since the merovingian period as austrasia neustria and aquitaine were conquered by the franks who established the frankish kingdom and pushed farther east to subjugate saxony and bavaria areas of what is today the eastern part of germany were inhabited by western slavic tribes of sorbs veleti and the obotritic confederation east francia and holy roman empire in 800 the frankish king charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the carolingian empire which was later divided in 843 among his heirs following the break up of the frankish realm for 900 years the history of germany was intertwined with the history of the holy roman empire which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of charlemagnes original empire the territory initially known as east francia stretched from the rhine in the west to the elbe river in the east and from the north sea to the alps the ottonian rulers 9191024 consolidated several major duchies and the german king otto i was crowned holy roman emperor of these regions in 962 in 996 gregory v became the first german pope appointed by his cousin otto iii whom he shortly after crowned holy roman emperor the holy roman empire absorbed northern italy and burgundy under the reign of the salian emperors 10241125 although the emperors lost power through the investiture controversy in the 12th century under the hohenstaufen emperors 11381254 german princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by slavs they encouraged german settlement in these areas called the eastern settlement movement ostsiedlung members of the hanseatic league which included mostly north german cities and towns prospered in the expansion of trade in the south the greater ravensburg trade corporation groe ravensburger handelsgesellschaft served a similar function the edict of the golden bull issued in 1356 by emperor charles iv provided the basic constitutional structure of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics population declined in the first half of the 14th century starting with the great famine in 1315 followed by the black death of 134850 despite the decline however german artists engineers and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as venice florence and genoa artistic and cultural centres throughout the german states produced such artists as the augsburg painters hans holbein and his son and albrecht drer johannes gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to europe a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses in 1517 the wittenberg monk martin luther publicised the ninety-five theses challenging the roman catholic church and initiating the protestant reformation in 1555 the peace of augsburg established lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to catholicism but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects a principle called cuius regio eius religio the agreement at augsburg failed to address other religious creed for example the reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler such as happened in electorate of cologne in 1583 from the cologne war until the end of the thirty years wars 16181648 religious conflict devastated german lands the latter reduced the overall population of the german states by about 30 per cent and in some places up to 80 per cent the peace of westphalia ended religious warfare among the imperial estates of the holy roman empire their mostly german-speaking rulers were able to choose either roman catholicism lutheranism or the reformed faith as their official religion after 1648 in the 18th century the holy roman empire consisted of approximately 1800 territories the elaborate legal system initiated by a series of imperial reforms approximately 14501555 created the imperial estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical secular and hereditary states reflected in the imperial diet the house of habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of charles vi in 1740 having no male heirs he had convinced the electors to retain habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the pragmatic sanction of 1713 this was finally settled through the war of austrian succession in the treaty of aix-la-chapelle charles vis daughter maria theresa ruled the empire as empress consort when her husband francis i became holy roman emperor from 1740 the dualism between the austrian habsburg monarchy and the kingdom of prussia dominated the german history in 1772 then again in 1793 and 1795 the two dominant german states of prussia and austria along with the russian empire agreed to the partitions of poland dividing among themselves the lands of the polishlithuanian commonwealth as a result of the partitions millions of polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two german monarchies however the annexed territories though incorporated into the kingdom of prussia and the habsburg realm were not legally considered as a part of the holy roman empire during the period of the french revolutionary wars along with the arrival of the napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the imperial diet most of the secular free imperial cities were annexed by dynastic territories the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed in 1806 the imperium was dissolved many german states particularly the rhineland states fell under the influence of france until 1815 france russia prussia and the habsburgs austria competed for hegemony in the german states during the napoleonic wars german confederation and empire following the fall of napoleon the congress of vienna convened in 1814 founded the german confederation deutscher bund a loose league of 39 sovereign states the appointment of the emperor of austria as the permanent president of the confederation reflected the congresss failure to accept prussias rising influence among the german states and acerbated the long-standing competition between the hohenzollern and habsburg interests disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements followed by new measures of repression by austrian statesman metternich the zollverein a tariff union furthered economic unity in the german states national and liberal ideals of the french revolution gained increasing support among many especially young germans the hambach festival in may 1832 was a main event in support of german unity freedom and democracy in the light of a series of revolutionary movements in europe which established a republic in france intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the german states king frederick william iv of prussia was offered the title of emperor but with a loss of power he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution leading to a temporary setback for the movement king william i appointed otto von bismarck as the new minister president of prussia in 1862 bismarck successfully concluded war on denmark in 1864 which promoted german over danish interests in the jutland peninsula the subsequent and decisive prussian victory in the austro-prussian war of 1866 enabled him to create the north german confederation norddeutscher bund which excluded austria from the federations affairs after the french defeat in the franco-prussian war the german princes proclaimed the founding of the german empire in 1871 at versailles uniting all the scattered parts of germany except austria and the german-speaking parts of switzerland prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire the hohenzollern king of prussia ruled as its concurrent emperor and berlin became its capital in the grnderzeit period following the unification of germany bismarcks foreign policy as chancellor of germany under emperor william i secured germanys position as a great nation by forging alliances isolating france by diplomatic means and avoiding war under wilhelm ii germany like other european powers took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries most alliances in which germany had previously been involved were not renewed this resulted in the creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of austria-hungary promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support subsequently the triple alliance of 1882 included italy completing a central european geographic alliance that illustrated german austrian and italian fears of incursions against them by france andor russia similarly britain france and russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against habsburg interference with russian interests in the balkans or german interference against france at the berlin conference in 1884 germany claimed several colonies including german east africa german south west africa togoland and kamerun later germany further expanded its colonial empire to include german new guinea german micronesia and german samoa in the pacific and kiautschou bay in china in what became known as the first genocide of the twentieth-century between 1904 and 1907 the german colonial government in south west africa present-day namibia ordered the annihilation of the local herero and namaqua peoples as a punitive measure for an uprising against german colonial rule in total around 100000 people80 of the herero and 50 of the namaquaperished from imprisonment in concentration camps where the majority died of disease abuse and exhaustion or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water the assassination of austrias crown prince on 28 june 1914 provided the pretext for the austrian empire to attack serbia and trigger world war i after four years of warfare in which approximately two million german soldiers were killed a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 november and german troops returned home in the german revolution november 1918 emperor wilhelm ii and all german ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities germanys new political leadership signed the treaty of versailles in 1919 in this treaty germany as part of the central powers accepted defeat by the allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of adolf hitler after the defeat in the first world war germany lost around 13 of its european territory areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic polish french and danish populations which were lost following the greater poland uprising the return of alsace-lorraine and the schleswig plebiscites and all of its colonial possessions in africa and the south sea weimar republic and nazi germany germany was declared a federal republic at the beginning of the german revolution in november 1918 with 18 substates in 1925 on 11 august 1919 president friedrich ebert signed the democratic weimar constitution in the subsequent struggle for power the radical-left communists seized power in bavaria but conservative elements in other parts of germany attempted to overthrow the republic in the kapp putsch it was supported by parts of the reichswehr military and other conservative nationalistic and monarchist factions after a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres the occupation of the ruhr by belgian and french troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 192223 a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the golden twenties an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of partial stabilisation the worldwide great depression hit germany in 1929 after the federal election of 1930 chancellor heinrich brnings government was enabled by president paul von hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval brnings government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30 by 1932 the nazi party led by adolf hitler won the special federal election of 1932 after a series of unsuccessful cabinets hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor of germany on 30 january 1933 after the reichstag fire a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first nazi concentration camp at dachau opened the enabling act of 1933 gave hitler unrestricted legislative power subsequently his government established a centralised totalitarian state withdrew from the league of nations following a national referendum and began military rearmament using deficit spending a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects in public work projects of 1934 17million germans immediately were put to work which gave them an income and social benefits the most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway the reichsautobahn known as the german autobahns other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the rur dam water supplies such as zillierbach dam and transportation hubs such as zwickau hauptbahnhof over the next five years unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose in 1935 the regime withdrew from the treaty of versailles and introduced the nuremberg laws which targeted jews and other minorities germany also reacquired control of the saar in 1935 remilitarised the rhineland in 1936 annexed austria in 1938 annexed the sudetenland in 1938 with the munich agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the protectorate of bohemia and moravia in march 1939 kristallnacht or the night of broken glass saw the burning of hundreds of synagogues the destruction of thousands of jewish businesses and the arrest of around 30000 jewish men by nazi forces inside germany many jewish women were arrested and placed in jails and a curfew was placed on the jewish people in germany in august 1939 hitlers government negotiated and signed the molotovribbentrop pact that divided eastern europe into german and soviet spheres of influence following the agreement on 1 september 1939 germany invaded poland marking the beginning of world war ii in europe in response to hitlers actions two days later on 3 september after a british ultimatum to germany to cease military operations was ignored britain and france declared war on germany in the spring of 1940 germany conquered denmark and norway the netherlands belgium luxembourg and france forcing the french government to sign an armistice after german troops occupied most of the country the british repelled german air attacks in the battle of britain in the same year in 1941 german troops invaded yugoslavia greece and the soviet union by 1942 germany and other axis powers controlled most of continental europe and north africa but following the soviet unions victory at the battle of stalingrad the allies reconquest of north africa and invasion of italy in 1943 german forces suffered repeated military defeats in june 1944 the western allies landed in france and the soviets pushed into eastern europe by late 1944 the western allies had entered germany despite one final german counter offensive in the ardennes forest following hitlers suicide during the battle of berlin german armed forces surrendered on 8 may 1945 ending world war ii in europe after world war ii former members of the nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the nuremberg trials in what later became known as the holocaust the german government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior peoples in total over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered including 6million jews between 220000 and 1500000 romani 275000 persons with disabilities thousands of jehovahs witnesses thousands of homosexuals and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition from germany and occupied countries nacht und nebel nazi policies in german occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 27million poles 13million ukrainians 1 million belarusians and an estimated 35 million soviet war prisoners in addition the nazi regime abducted approximately 12 million people from across the german occupied europe for use as slave labour in german industry german military war casualties have been estimated at 53million and around 900000 german civilians died 400000 from allied bombing and 500000 in the course of the soviet invasion from the east around 12million ethnic germans were expelled from across eastern europe germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites east and west germany after nazi germany surrendered the allies partitioned berlin and germanys remaining territory into four military occupation zones the western sectors controlled by france the united kingdom and the united states were merged on 23 may 1949 to form the federal republic of germany bundesrepublik deutschland on 7 october 1949 the soviet zone became the german democratic republic deutsche demokratische republik they were informally known as west germany and east germany east germany selected east berlin as its capital while west germany chose bonn as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo west germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a social market economy starting in 1948 west germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the marshall plan and used this to rebuild its industry konrad adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor bundeskanzler of germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963 under his and ludwig erhards leadership the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s that became known as an economic miracle wirtschaftswunder the federal republic of germany joined nato in 1955 and was a founding member of the european economic community in 1957 east germany was an eastern bloc state under political and military control by the ussr via occupation forces and the warsaw pact although east germany claimed to be a democracy political power was exercised solely by leading members politbro of the communist-controlled socialist unity party of germany supported by the stasi an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society a soviet-style command economy was set up and the gdr later became a comecon state while east german propaganda was based on the benefits of the gdrs social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a west german invasion many of its citizens looked to the west for freedom and prosperity the berlin wall rapidly built on 13 august 1961 prevented east german citizens from escaping to west germany eventually becoming a symbol of the cold war ronald reagans tear down this wall speech at the wall on 12 june 1987 echoed john f kennedys ich bin ein berliner speech of 26 june 1963 the fall of the wall in 1989 became a symbol of the fall of communism the dissolution of the soviet union german reunification and die wende tensions between east and west germany were reduced in the early 1970s by chancellor willy brandts ostpolitik in summer 1989 hungary decided to dismantle the iron curtain and open the borders causing the emigration of thousands of east germans to west germany via hungary this had devastating effects on the gdr where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support the east german authorities eased the border restrictions allowing east german citizens to travel to the west originally intended to help retain east germany as a state the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the wende reform process this culminated in the two plus four treaty a year later on 12 september 1990 under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the instrument of surrender and germany regained full sovereignty this permitted german reunification on 3 october 1990 with the accession of the five re-established states of the former gdr reunified germany and the european union the united germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the federal republic of germany and not a successor state as such it retained all of west germanys memberships in international organisations based on the berlinbonn act adopted in 1994 berlin once again became the capital of the reunified germany while bonn obtained the unique status of a bundesstadt federal city retaining some federal ministries the relocation of the government was completed in 1999 following the 1998 elections spd politician gerhard schrder became the first chancellor of a redgreen coalition with the alliance 90the greens party among the major projects of the two schrder legislatures was the agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment the modernisation and integration of the eastern german economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019 with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly 80billion since reunification germany has taken a more active role in the european union together with its european partners germany signed the maastricht treaty in 1992 established the eurozone in 1999 and signed the lisbon treaty in 2007 germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the balkans and sent a force of german troops to afghanistan as part of a nato effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the taliban these deployments were controversial since germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles in the 2005 elections angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany as the leader of a grand coalition in 2009 the german government approved a 50billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn in 2009 a liberal-conservative coalition under merkel assumed leadership of the country in 2013 a grand coalition was established in a third merkel cabinet among the major german political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of european integration the energy transition energiewende for a sustainable energy supply the debt brake for balanced budgets measures to increase the fertility rate significantly pronatalism and high-tech strategies for the future transition of the german economy summarised as industry 40 germany was affected by the european migrant crisis in 2015

warm and longer dry periods can occur central and southern germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental in addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country the alpine regions in the extreme south and to a lesser degree some areas of the central german uplands have a mountain climate with lower temperatures and more precipitation though the german climate is rarely extreme there are occasional spikes of cold or heat winter temperatures can sometimes drop to two-digit negative temperatures for a few days in a row
