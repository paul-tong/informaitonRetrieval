programming they can listen through built-in or portable receivers in automobiles in the home and office with a portable or tabletop receiver equipped to connect the receiver to a stereo system or on the internet ground stations transmit signals to the satellites which are 35786 kilometers 22236 miles above the equator in clarke belt orbits the satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes this signal contains scrambled broadcasts along with meta data about each specific broadcast the signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules which display the broadcast information in urban areas ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked the technology allows for nationwide broadcasting so that for instance us listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country content availability and market penetration satellite radio in the us offers commercial-free music stations as well as news sports and talk some of which include commercials in 2004 satellite radio companies in the united states began providing background music to hotels retail chains restaurants airlines and other businesses on april 30

security and safety such as stolen vehicle tracking and roadside assistance and entertainment such as weather and gas prices as of q3 2016 siriusxm had 31 million subscribers this was primarily due to

deals with general motors ford toyota kia bentley bmw volkswagen nissan hyundai and mitsubishi the presence of howard stern whose show attracts over 12 million listeners per week has also been a factor in the companys steady growth as of 2013 the main competition to satellite radio is streaming internet services such as pandora and spotify as well as fm and am radio satellite radio vs other formats satellite radio differs from am fm radio and digital television radio dtr in the following ways the table applies primarily to the united states the sound quality with both satellite radio providers and dtr providers varies with each channel some channels have near cd-quality audio and others use low-bandwidth audio suitable only for speech since only a certain amount of bandwidth is available within the licenses available adding more channels means that the quality on some channels must be reduced both the frequency response and the dynamic range of satellite channels can be superior to most but not all am or fm radio stations as most am and fm stations clip the audio peaks to sound louder even the worst channels are still superior to most am radios but a very few am tuners are equal to or better than the best fm or satellite broadcasts when tuned to a local station even if not capable of stereo the use of hd radio technology can allow am and fm broadcasts to exceed the quality of satellite am does not suffer from multipath distortion or flutter in a moving vehicle like fm nor does it become silent as you go behind a big hill like satellite radio some satellite radio services and dtr services act as in situ repeaters for local amfm stations and thus feature a high frequency of interruption nonprofit stations and public radio networks such as pri-affiliated stations and the bbc are commercial-free in the us all stations are required to have periodic station identifications and public service announcements in the united states the fcc regulates technical broadcast spectrum only program content is unregulated however the fcc has tried in the past to expand its reach to regulate content to satellite radio and cable television and its options are still open to attempt such in the future the fcc does issue licenses to siriusxm the satellite radio provider and controls who holds these licenses to broadcast many of their channels including the pop music ones are self-regulated degree of content regulation varies by country however the majority of industrialized nations have regulations regarding obscene andor objectionable content see also radio portal digital multimedia broadcasting list of united states radio networks mobaho ripping music from satellite radio broadcasts satellite subcarrier audio sirius xm radio navis
