in science priority is the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time thus between two or more independent discoverers the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner hence the tradition is often referred to as the priority rule the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase publish or perish because there are no second prizes in a way the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society such as discovery of malaria transmission dna hiv etc on the other hand it can create an unhealthy competition thus becoming detrimental to scientific progress priority disputes priority becomes a difficult issue usually in the context of priority disputes where the priority for a given theory understanding or discovery comes into question in most cases historians of science disdain retrospective priority disputes as enterprises which generally lack understanding about the nature of scientific change and usually involve gross misreadings of the past to support the idea of a long-lost priority claim historian and biologist stephen jay gould once remarked that debates about the priority of ideas are usually among the most misdirected in the history of science richard feynman told freeman dyson that he avoided priority disputes by always giving the bastards more credit than they deserve dyson remarked that he also follows this rule and that this practice is remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends origin the priority rule came into existence before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established for example the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz in the 17th century about priority in the invention of calculus this particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice it has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science in the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity such as charles darwin and albert einstein priority questions are often rooted in taking too seriously the myth of the lone genius which is often cultivated around such quasi-mythic figures see great man theory and whig history in an attempt to laud such scientists as visionaries the context in which they worked is often neglected by popularizers making it appear as if they worked without assistance or without reference to other work something which is rarely the case see also list of scientific priority disputes multiple discovery stiglers law priority certificate priority right in patent law barbalet j science and emotions pp132150 in barbalet jed emotions and sociology sociological review monograph blackwell publishing oxford 2002 boring eg cognitive dissonance its use in science science vol145 no3633 14 august 1964 pp680685 boring eg the problem of originality in science the american journal of psychology vol39 nos1-4 december 1927 pp7090 hanson nr patterns of discovery an inquiry into the conceptual foundations of science cambridge university press cambridge 1962 merton rk priorities in scientific discovery a chapter in the sociology of science american sociological review vol22 no6 december 1957 pp635659 merton rk science and democratic social structures pp604615 in merton rk social theory and social structure 1968 enlarged edition the free press new york 1968 originally published as a note on science and democracy journal of legal and political sociology vol1 nos1-2 1942 pp115126 samelson f history origin myth and ideology discovery of social psychology journal for the theory of social behaviour vol4 no2 october 1974 pp217232 samelson f whig and anti-whig histories and other curiosities of social psychology journal of the history of the behavioral sciences vol36 no4 fall 2000 pp499506
