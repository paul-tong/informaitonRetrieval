the north american x-15 was a hypersonic rocket-powered aircraft operated by the united states air force and the national aeronautics and space administration as part of the x-plane series of experimental aircraft the x-15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design the x-15s official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a manned powered aircraft set in october 1967 when william j knight flew mach 670 at 102100 feet 31120m a speed of 4520 miles per hour 7274kmh 2021ms has remained unbroken as of 2017 during the x-15 program 13 flights by eight pilots met the air force spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of 50 miles 80km thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts the air force pilots qualified for astronaut wings immediately while the civilian pilots were eventually awarded nasa astronaut wings in 2005 35 years after the last x-15 flight the only navy pilot in the x-15 program never took the aircraft above the requisite 50 mile 80 km altitude and thus never earned astronaut wings design and development the x-15 was based on a concept study from walter dornberger for the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca for a hypersonic research aircraft the requests for proposal rfps were published on 30 december 1954 for the airframe and on 4 february 1955 for the rocket engine the x-15 was built by two manufacturers north american aviation was contracted for the airframe in november 1955 and reaction motors was contracted for building the engines in 1956 like many x-series aircraft the x-15 was designed to be carried aloft and drop launched from under the wing of a b-52 mother ship air force nb-52a the high and mighty one serial 52-0003 and nb-52b the challenger serial 52-0008 aka balls 8 served as carrier planes for all x-15 flights release took place at an altitude of about 85 miles 137km and a speed of about 500 miles per hour 805kmh the x-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical with rear fairings that flattened its appearance and thick dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant nickel alloy inconel-x 750 the retractable landing gear comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skids the skids did not extend beyond the ventral fin which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin just before landing the lower fin was recovered by parachute cockpit and pilot systems the x-15 was the product of developmental research and changes were made to various systems over the course of the program and between the different models the x-15 was operated under several different scenarios including attachment to a launch aircraft drop main engine start and acceleration ballistic flight into thin airspace re-entry into thicker air unpowered glide to landing and direct landing without a main-engine start the main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight but boosted the x-15 to its high speeds and altitudes without main engine thrust the x-15s instruments and control surfaces remained functional but the aircraft could not maintain altitude because the x-15 also had to be controlled in an environment where there was too little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces it had a reaction control system rcs that used rocket thrusters there were two different x-15 pilot control setups one used three joysticks the other one joystick the x-15 type with multiple control sticks for the pilot placed a traditional rudder and stick between a left joystick that sent commands to the reaction control system and a third joystick on the right used during high-g maneuvers to augment the center stick in addition to pilot input the x-15 stability augmentation system sas sent inputs to the aerodynamic controls to help the pilot maintain attitude control the reaction control system rcs could be operated in two modes manual and automatic the automatic mode used a feature called reaction augmentation system ras that helped stabilize the vehicle at high altitude the ras was typically used for approximately three minutes of an x-15 flight before automatic power off the alternative control setup used the mh-96 flight control system which allowed one joystick in place of three and simplified pilot input the mh-96 could automatically blend aerodynamic and rocket controls depending on how effective each system was at controlling the aircraft among the many controls were the rocket engine throttle and a control for jettisoning the ventral tail fin other features of the cockpit included heated windows to prevent icing and a forward headrest for periods of high deceleration the x-15 had an ejection seat designed to operate at speeds up to mach4 4480kmh 2784mph andor 120000 feet 37km altitude although it was never used during the program in the event of ejection the seat was designed to deploy fins which were used until it reached a safer speedaltitude at which to deploy its main parachute pilots wore pressure suits which could be pressurized with nitrogen gas above 35000 feet 11km altitude the cockpit was pressurized to 35psi 024atm with nitrogen gas while oxygen for breathing was fed separately to the pilot propulsion the initial 24 powered flights used two reaction motors xlr11 liquid-propellant rocket engines enhanced to provide a total of 16000 pounds-force 71kn of thrust as compared to the 6000 pounds-force 27kn that a single xlr11 provided in 1947 to make the bell x-1 the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound the xlr11 used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen by november 1960 reaction motors was able to deliver the xlr99 rocket engine generating 57000 pounds-force 250kn of thrust the remaining 175 flights of the x-15 used xlr99 engines in a single engine configuration the xlr99 used anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen as propellant and hydrogen peroxide to drive the high-speed turbopump that delivered propellants to the engine it could burn 15000 pounds 6804kg of propellant in 80 seconds jules bergman titled his book on the program ninety seconds to space to describe the total powered flight time of the aircraft the x-15 reaction control system rcs for maneuvering in low-pressuredensity environment used high-test peroxide htp which decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds the htp also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units apus additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems wedge tail and hypersonic stability the x-15 had a thick wedge tail to enable it to fly in a steady manner at hypersonic speeds this produced a significant amount of drag at lower speeds the blunt end at the rear of the x-15 could produce as much drag as an entire f-104 starfighter a wedge shape was used because it is more effective than the conventional tail as a stabilizing surface at hypersonic speeds a vertical-tail area equal to 60 percent of the wing area was required to give the x-15 adequate directional stability stability at hypersonic speeds was aided by side panels which could be extended from the tail to increase the overall surface area and these panels doubled as air-brakes operational history altitudes attained by x-15 aircraft fell short of those of alan shepards and gus grissoms project mercury space capsules in 1961 or of any other manned spacecraft however the x-15 ranks supreme among manned rocket-powered aircraft becoming the worlds first operational spaceplane in the early 1960s before 1958 united states air force usaf and naca officials discussed an orbital x-15 spaceplane the x-15b that would launch into outer space from atop an sm-64 navaho missile this was canceled when the naca became nasa and adopted project mercury instead by 1959 the boeing x-20 dyna-soar space-glider program was to become the usafs preferred means for launching military manned spacecraft into orbit this program was canceled in the early 1960s before an operational vehicle could be built various configurations of the navajo were considered and another proposal involved a titan i stage three x-15s were built flying 199 test flights the last on 24 october 1968 the first x-15 flight was an unpowered glide flight by scott crossfield on 8 june 1959 crossfield also piloted the first powered flight on 17 september 1959 and his first flight with the xlr-99 rocket engine on 15 november 1960 twelve test pilots flew the x-15 among these were neil armstrong later a nasa astronaut and first man to set foot on the moon and joe engle later a commander of nasa space shuttle missions in a 1962 proposal nasa considered using the b-52x-15 as a launch platform for a blue scout rocket to place satellites weighing up to 150 pounds 68kg into orbit in july and august 1963 pilot joseph a walker exceeded 100 km in altitude joining nasa astronauts and soviet cosmonauts as the first human beings to cross that line on their way to outer space the usaf awarded astronaut wings to anyone achieving an altitude of 50 miles 80km while the fai set the limit of space at 100 kilometers 621mi on 15 november 1967 us air force test pilot major michael j adams was killed during x-15 flight 191 when x-15-3 af ser no 56-6672 entered a hypersonic spin while descending then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry as his aircrafts flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits acceleration built to 15g0 150ms vertical and 80g0 78ms lateral the airframe broke apart at 60000 feet 18km altitude scattering the x-15s wreckage for 50 square miles 130km on 8 may 2004 a monument was erected at the cockpits locale near randsburg california major adams was posthumously awarded air force astronaut wings for his final flight in x-15-3 which had reached an altitude of 504 miles 811km in 1991 his name was added to the astronaut memorial the second plane x-15-2 was rebuilt after a landing accident on 9 november 1962 which damaged the craft and injured its pilot john mckay it was lengthened by 24 feet 73cm had a pair of auxiliary fuel tanks attached beneath its fuselage and wings and a complete heat-resistant ablative coating was added the plane was renamed the x-15a-2 and took flight for the first time on 25 june 1964 it reached its maximum speed of 4520 miles per hour 7274kmh in october 1967 with pilot william pete knight of the us air force in control five principal aircraft were used during

retired in november 2004 additionally f-100 f-104 and f5d chase aircraft and c-130 and c-47 transports supported the program a 200th flight over nevada was first scheduled for 21 november 1968 to be flown by william pete knight numerous technical problems and outbreaks of bad weather delayed this proposed flight six times and it was permanently canceled on 20 december 1968 this x-15 was detached from the b-52 and then put into indefinite storage the aircraft was later donated to the air force museum at wright-patterson air force base for display nb-52a sn 52-003 permanent test variant

astronauts according to the united states definition of the space border all five air force pilots flew above 50 miles and were awarded military astronaut wings contemporaneously with their achievements including adams who received the distinction posthumously following the flight 191 disaster however the other three were nasa employees and did not receive a comparable decoration at the time in 2004 the federal aviation administration conferred its first-ever commercial astronaut wings on mike melvill and brian binnie pilots of the commercial spaceshipone another spaceplane with a flight profile comparable to the x-15s following this in 2005 nasa retroactively awarded its civilian astronaut wings to dana then living and to mckay and walker posthumously of the thirteen flights
