the kinetic theory of gases describes a gas as a large number of submicroscopic particles atoms or molecules all of which are in constant rapid random motion the randomness arises from the particles many collisions with each other and with the walls of the container kinetic theory of gases explains the macroscopic properties of gases such as pressure temperature viscosity thermal conductivity and volume by considering their molecular composition and motion the theory posits that gas pressure results from particles collisions with the walls of a container at different velocities kinetic molecular theory defines temperature in its own way in contrast with the thermodynamic definition under an optical microscope the molecules making up a liquid are too small to be visible however the jittery motion of pollen grains or dust particles in liquid are visible known as brownian motion the motion of the pollen or dust results from their collisions with the liquids molecules history in approximately 50 bce the roman philosopher lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other this epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries when aristotlean ideas were dominant in 1738 daniel bernoulli published hydrodynamica which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases in this work bernoulli posited the argument still used to this day that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion the theory was not immediately accepted in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic other pioneers of the kinetic theory which were neglected by their contemporaries were mikhail lomonosov 1747 georges-louis le sage ca 1780 published 1818 john herapath 1816 and john james waterston 1843 which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation in 1856 august krnig probably after reading a paper of waterston created a simple gas-kinetic model which only considered the translational motion of the particles in 1857 rudolf clausius according to his own words independently of krnig developed a similar but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to krnig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions in this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle in 1859 after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by rudolf clausius scottish physicist james clerk maxwell formulated the maxwell distribution of molecular velocities which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range this was the first-ever statistical law in physics maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium in his 1873 thirteen page article molecules maxwell states we are told that an atom is a material point invested and surrounded by potential forces and that when flying molecules strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases in 1871 ludwig boltzmann generalized maxwells achievement and formulated the maxwellboltzmann distribution also the logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was first stated by him in the beginning of the twentieth century however atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs rather than real objects an important turning point was albert einsteins 1905 and marian smoluchowskis 1906 papers on brownian motion which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory assumptions the theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions the gas consists of very small particles known as molecules this smallness of their size is such that the total volume of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules this is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size these particles have the same mass the number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied the rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container all these collisions are perfectly elastic this means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature except during collisions the interactions among molecules are negligible that is they exert no forces on one another the average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the absolute temperature of the system the kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature not identical with the thermodynamic definition the elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the containers wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions there are negligible gravitational force on molecules more modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the boltzmann equation these can accurately describe the properties of dense gases because they include the volume of the molecules the necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects molecular chaos and small gradients in bulk properties expansions to higher orders in the density are known as virial expansions an important book on kinetic theory is that by chapman and cowling an important approach to the subject is called chapmanenskog theory there have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by grad based on moment expansions in the other limit for extremely rarefied gases the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths this is known as the knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the knudsen number equilibrium properties pressure and kinetic energy in kinetic model of gases the pressure is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface consider a gas of n molecules each of mass m enclosed in a cube of volume v l when a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the x axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed an elastic collision the change in momentum is given by where p is the momentum i and f indicate initial and final momentum before and after collision x indicates that only the x direction is being considered and v is the speed of the particle which is the same before and after the collision the particle impacts one specific side wall once every where l is the distance between opposite walls the force due to this particle is the total force on the wall is where the bar denotes an average over the n particles since the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction the average squared speed in each direction is identical by pythagorean theorem in three dimensions the total squared speed v is given by therefore and the force can be written as this force is exerted on an area l therefore the pressure of the gas is where v l is the volume of the box in terms of the kinetic energy of the gas k this is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure a macroscopic property to the translational kinetic energy of the molecules n 1 2 m v 2 displaystyle nfrac 12moverline v2 which is a microscopic property temperature and kinetic energy rewriting the above result for the pressure as p v n m v 2 3 displaystyle pvnmoverline v2 over 3 we may combine it with the ideal gas law where k b displaystyle displaystyle kb is the boltzmann constant and t displaystyle displaystyle t the absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law to obtain which leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule the kinetic energy of the system is n times that of a molecule namely k 1 2 n m v 2 displaystyle kfrac 12nmoverline v2 then the temperature t displaystyle displaystyle t takes the form which becomes eq3 is one important result of the kinetic theory the average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas laws absolute temperature from eq1 and eq3 we have thus the product of pressure and volume per mole is proportional to the average translational molecular kinetic energy eq1 and eq4 are called the classical results which could also be derived from statistical mechanics for more details see since there are 3 n displaystyle displaystyle 3n degrees of freedom in a monatomic-gas system with n displaystyle displaystyle n particles the kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is in the kinetic energy per degree of freedom the constant of proportionality of temperature is 12 times boltzmann constant or r2 per mole in addition to this the temperature will decrease when the pressure drops to a certain point this result is related to the equipartition theorem as noted in the article on heat capacity diatomic gases should have 7 degrees of freedom but the lighter diatomic gases act as if they have only 5 monatomic gases have 3 degrees of freedom thus the kinetic energy per kelvin monatomic ideal gas is 3 r2 3r2 per mole 1247 j per molecule 207 yj 129 ev at standard temperature 27315 k we get per mole 3406 j per molecule 565 zj 352

gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium this means using kinetic theory to consider what are known as transport properties such as mass diffusivity viscosity and thermal conductivity the following discussion are all based on transport equation diffusion coefficient and diffusion flux viscosity and kinetic momentum in books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer the upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force f the lower plate is stationary and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest the molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component u displaystyle u which increase uniformly with distance y displaystyle y above the lower plate the non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a maxwell-boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions let displaystyle sigma be the collision cross section

first collision let u 0 displaystyle u0 be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer on the average a molecule that crosses the surface makes its last collision before crossing at a distance equal to two-thirds of the mean free path ie 2 l 3 displaystyle 2l3 away from the surface at this distance above and below the surface the forward momentum of the molecule is respectively p x m u 0 2 3 l d u d y displaystyle quad pxpm mleftu0pm frac 23ldu over dyright where m is the molecular mass the molecular flux displaystyle phi includes all molecules

the number flux is related to the average molecular speed v displaystyle bar v by 1 4 v c displaystyle quad phi frac 14bar vc notice that the forward velocity gradient d u d y displaystyle dudy can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path next we multiply by the total flux to get the change of momentum per unit time and per unit area that is carried by the molecules crossing

reasonably spherical molecule the interaction potential is more like the lennard-jones potential or morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer
