han to early tang imperial china nanjing first became a state capital in ad229 when the state of eastern wu founded by sun quan during the three kingdoms period relocated its capital to jianye the city extended on the basis of jinling yi in ad211 although conquered by the western jin dynasty in 280 nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated and developed into one of the commercial cultural and political centers of china during the rule of east wu this city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries shortly after the unification of the region the western jin dynasty collapsed first the rebellions by eight jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the jin dynasty in the north in 317 remnants of the jin court as well as nobles and wealthy families fled from the north to the south and reestablished the jin court in nanjing which was then called jiankang replacing luoyang this marked the first time a chinese dynastic capital moved to southern china during the period of northsouth division nanjing remained the capital of the southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries during this time nanjing was the international hub of east asia based on historical documents the city had 280000 registered households assuming an average nanjing household consisted of about 51 people the city had more than 14million residents a number of sculptural ensembles of that era erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries have survived in various degrees of preservation in nanjings northeastern and eastern suburbs primarily in qixia and jiangning district possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the tomb of xiao xiu 475518 a brother of emperor wu of liang the period of division ended when the sui dynasty reunified china and almost destroyed the entire city turning it into a small town the city of nanjing was razed after the sui dynasty took it over it was renamed shengzhou in the tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late tang it was chosen as the capital and called jinling during the southern tang 937976 a state that succeeded wu state it was renamed jiangning in the northern song dynasty and renamed jiankang in the southern song dynasty jiankangs textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the song dynasty despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the jurchen-led jin dynasty the court of da chu a short-lived puppet state established by the jurchens and the court of song were once in the city song was eventually exterminated by the mongol empire under the name yuan and in the yuan dynasty the citys status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated the first emperor of the ming dynasty zhu yuanzhang the hongwu emperor who overthrew the yuan dynasty renamed the city yingtian rebuilt it and made it the dynastic capital in 1368 he constructed a 48km 30mi long city wall around yingtian as well as a new ming palace complex and government halls it took 200000 laborers 21years to finish the project the present-day city wall of nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved it is among the longest surviving city walls in china the jianwen emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402 it is believed that nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487000 in 1400 in 1421 the yongle emperor persisted in relocating the capital to beijing however he had to withdraw his order before his death his successor the hongxi emperor wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from nanjing to beijing that had happened during the yongle reign on 24 february 1425 he appointed admiral zheng he as the defender of nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the ming treasure fleet for the citys defenses zheng he governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters awaiting the hongxi emperors return along with the military establishment from the north the emperor died on 29 may 1425 before this could have taken place so beijing remained the de facto capital and nanjing remained the secondary capital the succeeding xuande emperor remained in beijing so the aforementioned nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution in official ming documents of 1425 to 1441 nanjing was designated as the capital and beijing was designated as the temporary capital in 1441 emperor yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word provisional on the beijing government seals any longer while nanjings need to prefix nanjing for distinguishing purposes remained hence nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limit power before 1644 besides the city wall other famous ming-era structures in the city included the famous ming xiaoling mausoleum and porcelain tower although the latter was destroyed by the taipings in the 19th century either in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties a monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early ming dynasty is the yangshan quarry located some 1520km 912mi east of the walled city and ming xiaoling mausoleum where a gigantic stele cut on the orders of the yongle emperor lies abandoned just as it was left 600years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it as the center of the empire early-ming nanjing had worldwide connections it was home of the admiral zheng he who went to sail the pacific and indian oceans and it was visited by foreign dignitaries such as a king from borneo bn who died during his visit to china in 1408 the tomb of the king of boni with a spirit way and a tortoise stele was discovered in yuhuatai district south of the walled city in 1958 and has been restored over two centuries after the removal of the capital to beijing nanjing was destined to become the capital of a ming emperor one more time after the fall of beijing to li zichengs rebel forces and then to the manchu-led qing dynasty in the spring of 1644 the ming prince zhu yousong was enthroned in nanjing in june 1644 as the hongguang emperor his short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called southern ming dynasty zhu yousong however fared a lot worse than his ancestor zhu yuanzhang three centuries earlier beset by factional conflicts his regime could not offer effective resistance to qing forces when the qing army led by the manchu prince dodo approached jiangnan the next spring days after yangzhou fell to the manchus in
