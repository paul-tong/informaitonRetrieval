country that occupies the eastern half of the island of new guinea and its offshore islands in melanesia a region of the southwestern pacific ocean north of australia its capital located along its southeastern coast is port moresby the western half of new guinea forms the indonesian provinces of papua and west papua at the national level after being ruled by three external powers since 1884 papua new guinea established its sovereignty in 1975 this followed nearly 60 years of australian administration which started during world war i it became an independent commonwealth realm in 1975 with queen elizabeth ii as its head of state and became a member of the commonwealth of nations in its own right papua new guinea is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world it is also one of the most rural as only 18 per cent of its people live in urban centres there are 852 known languages in the country of which 12 now have no known living speakers most of the population of more than 8 million people lives in customary communities which are as diverse as the languages the country is one of the worlds least explored culturally and geographically it is known to have numerous groups of uncontacted peoples and researchers believe there are many undiscovered species of plants and animals in the interior papua new guinea is classified as a developing economy by the international monetary fund strong growth in papua new guineas mining and resource sector led to the country becoming the sixth-fastest-growing economy in the world in 2011 growth was expected to slow once major resource projects came on line in 2015 mining remains a major economic factor however local and national governments are discussing the potential of resuming mining operations at the panguna mine in bougainville province which has been closed since the civil war in the 1980s1990s nearly 40 per cent of the population lives a self-sustainable natural lifestyle with no access to global capital most of the people still live in strong traditional social groups based on farming their social lives combine traditional religion with modern practices including primary education these societies and clans are explicitly acknowledged by the papua new guinea constitution which expresses the wish for traditional villages and communities to remain as viable units of papua new guinean society and protects their continuing importance to local and national community life the nation is an observer state in the association of southeast asian nations or asean since 1976 and has already filed its application for full membership status it is a full member of the pacific islands forum formerly south pacific forum and the commonwealth of nations history archaeological evidence indicates that humans first arrived in papua new guinea around 42000 to 45000 years ago they were descendants of migrants out of africa in one of the early waves of human migration agriculture was independently developed in the new guinea highlands around 7000 bc making it one of the few areas in the world where people independently domesticated plants a major migration of austronesian-speaking peoples to coastal regions of new guinea took place around 500 bc this has been correlated with the introduction of pottery pigs and certain fishing techniques in the 18th century traders brought the sweet potato to new guinea where it was adopted and became part of the staples portuguese traders had obtained it from south america and introduced it to the moluccas the far higher crop yields from sweet potato gardens radically transformed traditional agriculture and societies sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple taro and resulted in a significant increase in population in the highlands although by the late 20th century headhunting and cannibalism had been practically eradicated in the past they were practised in many parts of the country as part of rituals related to warfare and taking in enemy spirits or powers in 1901 on goaribari island in the gulf of papua missionary harry dauncey found 10000 skulls in the islands long houses a demonstration of past practices according to marianna torgovnick writing in 1991 the most fully documented instances of cannibalism as a social institution come from new guinea where head-hunting and ritual cannibalism survived in certain isolated areas into the fifties sixties and seventies and still leave traces within certain social groups little was known in europe about the island until the 19th century although portuguese and spanish explorers such as dom jorge de menezes and yigo ortiz de retez had encountered it as early as the 16th century traders from southeast asia had visited new guinea beginning 5000 years ago to collect bird-of-paradise plumes the countrys dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence the word papua is derived from an old local term of uncertain origin new guinea nueva guinea was the name coined by the spanish explorer yigo ortiz de retez in 1545 he noted the resemblance of the people to those he had earlier seen along the guinea coast of africa guinea in its turn is etymologically derived from the portuguese word guin the name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies ultimately meaning land of the blacks or similar meanings in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants in the nineteenth century germany ruled the northern half of the country for some decades beginning in 1884 as a colony named german new guinea in 1914 after the outbreak of world war i australian forces landed and captured german new guinea in a small military campaign and occupied it throughout the war after the war in which germany and the central powers were defeated the league of nations authorised australia to administer this area as a league of nations mandate territory the southern half of the country had been colonised in 1884 by the united kingdom as british new guinea with the papua act 1905 the uk transferred this territory to the newly formed commonwealth of australia which took on its administration additionally from 1905 british new guinea was renamed as the territory of papua in contrast to establishing an australian mandate in former german new guinea the league of nations determined that papua was an external territory of the australian commonwealth as a matter of law it remained a british possession the difference in legal status meant that until 1949 papua and new guinea had entirely separate administrations both controlled by australia these conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the countrys post-independence legal system during world war ii the new guinea campaign 19421945 was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between japan and the allies approximately 216000 japanese australian and us servicemen died after world war ii and the victory of the allies the two territories were combined into the territory of papua and new guinea this was later referred to as papua new guinea the natives of papua appealed to the united nations for oversight and independence the nation established independence from australia on 16 september 1975 becoming a commonwealth realm continuing to share queen elizabeth ii as its head of state it maintains close ties with australia which continues to be its largest aid donor papua new guinea was admitted to membership in the united nations on 10 october 1975 a secessionist revolt in 197576 on bougainville island resulted in an eleventh-hour modification of the draft constitution of papua new guinea to allow for bougainville and the other eighteen districts to have quasi-federal status as provinces a renewed uprising on bougainville started in 1988 and claimed 20000 lives until it was resolved in 1997 bougainville had been the chief mining region of the country generating 40 of the national budget the native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining which poisoned the land water and air without gaining a fair share of the profits the government and rebels negotiated a peace agreement that established the bougainville autonomous district and province the autonomous bougainville elected joseph kabui as president in 2005 who served until his death in 2008 he was succeeded by his deputy john tabinaman as acting president while an election to fill the unexpired term was organised james tanis won that election in december 2008 and served until the inauguration of john momis the winner of the 2010 elections as part of the current peace settlement a referendum on independence is planned to be held in bougainville sometime before mid-2020 preparations were underway in 2015 numerous chinese have worked and lived in papua new guinea establishing chinese-majority communities chinese merchants became established in the islands before european exploration anti-chinese rioting involving tens of thousands of people broke out in may 2009 the initial spark was a fight between ethnic chinese and papua new guinean workers at a nickel factory under construction by a chinese company native resentment against chinese ownership of numerous small businesses and their commercial monopoly in the islands led to the rioting the chinese have long been merchants in papua new guinea in the same year papua new guinea asked various southeast asian nations for their support for papua new guineas full membership bid in the association of southeast asian nations asean indonesia supported the bid after papua new guinea supported indonesias hold on west papua however the philippines thailand vietnam and cambodia have expressed displeasure over papua new guineas anti-lgbt laws stating that equality-friendly timor-leste would most likely be a more feasible asean member state in the future in 2012 despite a refugee crisis at the border of papua new guinea and west papua the country was steadfast in its support of indonesia which promised papua new guinea a greater role in asean in the future by 2017 the indonesian-led genocide against west papuan natives peaked with almost 25 of the native population killed within a 50-year period the realisation caused massive backlash from oceanian nations against papua new guineas policy on west papua in january 2017 papua new guinea gave citizenship to 138 west papuan refugees in a bid to calm tensions in september 2017 papua new guinea rejected the west papuan independence petition in the united nations general assembly to the pleasure of indonesia from march to april 2018 a chain of earthquakes hit papua new guinea causing various damage various nations from oceania australia the philippines and timor-leste immediately sent aid to the country government and politics papua new guinea is a commonwealth realm queen elizabeth ii is its sovereign and head of state the constitutional convention which prepared the draft constitution and australia the outgoing metropolitan power had thought that papua new guinea would not remain a monarchy the founders however considered that imperial honours had a cachet the monarch is represented by the governor-general of papua new guinea currently bob dadae papua new guinea and the solomon islands are unusual among commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature rather than chosen by the executive branch the prime minister heads the cabinet which consists of 31 mps from the ruling coalition which make up the government the current prime minister is peter oneill the unicameral national parliament has 111 seats of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the national capital district ncd candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election a maximum of five years after the previous national election in the early years of independence the instability of the party system led to frequent votes of no confidence in parliament with resulting changes of the government but with referral to the electorate through national elections only occurring every five years in recent years successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election in december 2012 the first two of three readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months this restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government elections in png attract numerous candidates after independence in 1975 members were elected by the first-past-the-post system with winners frequently gaining less than 15 of the vote electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the limited preferential vote system lpv a version of the alternative vote the 2007 general election was the first to be conducted using lpv in 2011 there was a constitutional crisis between the parliament-elect prime minister peter oneill voted into office by a large majority of mps and sir michael somare who was deemed by the supreme court in a december opinion 32 to retain office the stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the july 2012 national elections with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature as well as a series of other laws passed for example limiting the age for a prime minister the confrontation reached a peak with the deputy prime minister entering the supreme court during a hearing escorted by some police ostensibly to arrest the chief justice there was strong pressure among some mps to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year although their powers to do that were highly questionable the parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed mps carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued slightly late but for the election itself to occur on time thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis the crisis was tense at times but largely restricted to the political and legal fraternity plus some police factions the public and public service including most police and military stood back it was a period when with increased telecommunication access and use of social media notably facebook and mobile phones the public and students played some part in helping maintain restraint and demanding the leadership to adhere to constitutional processes they insisted on having the elections so that the people could say who should be their legitimate representatives for the next five years under a 2002 amendment the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government if he can muster the necessary majority in parliament the process of forming such a coalition in png where parties do not have much ideology involves considerable horsetrading right up until the last moment peter oneill emerged as papua new guineas prime minister after the july 2012 election and formed a government with leo dion the former governor of east new britain province as deputy prime minister law the unicameral parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other jurisdictions that have cabinet responsible government or parliamentary democracy it is introduced by the executive government to the legislature debated and if passed becomes law when it receives royal assent by the governor-general most legislation is regulation implemented by the bureaucracy under enabling legislation previously passed by parliament all ordinary statutes enacted by parliament must be consistent with the constitution the courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law unusual among developing countries the judicial branch of government in papua new guinea has remained remarkably independent and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority the underlying law papua new guineas common law consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in english common law as it stood on 16 september 1975 the date of independence and thereafter the decisions of pngs own courts the courts are directed by the constitution and latterly the underlying law act to take note of the custom of traditional communities they are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law in practice this has proved extremely difficult and has been largely neglected statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions primarily australia and england advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries this national court system used in towns and cities is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas the law underpinning the village courts is customary law foreign policy in foreign policy papua new guinea is a member of the commonwealth of nations pacific islands forum and the melanesian spearhead group msg of countries it was accorded observer status within asean in 1976 followed later by special observer status in 1981 it is also a member of apec and an acp country associated with the european union the country has a low-key initiative when it comes to the indonesia-sponsored genocide in west papua due to its application in asean where the headquarters is in jakarta papua new guinea has positive ties with australia and countries in oceania it also has good ties with fellow-christian country the philippines especially in the education sector the countrys policy has been focusing on ties with southeast asia in recent years due to its application in asean which is supported by the philippines and co-observer timor-leste military the papua new guinea defence force pngdf is the military organisation responsible for the defence of papua new guinea human rights papua new guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for violence against women a 2013 study in the lancet found that 27 of men on bougainville island papua new guinea reported having raped a non-partner while 141 reported having committed gang rape according to unicef nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years of age and 13 are under 7 years of age a report by childfund australia citing former parliamentarian dame carol kidu claimed 50 of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16 25 are under 12 and 10 are under 8 the 1976 sorcery act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of black magic until the act was repealed in 2013 an estimated 50150 alleged witches are killed each year in papua new guinea there are also no protections given to lgbt citizens in the country homosexual acts are prohibited by law in papua new guinea administrative divisions papua new guinea is divided into four regions which are not the primary administrative divisions but are quite significant in many aspects of government commercial sporting and other activities the nation has 22 province-level divisions twenty provinces the autonomous region of bougainville and the national capital district each province is divided into one or more districts which in turn are divided into one or more local-level government areas provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country provincial governments are branches of the national governmentpapua new guinea is not a federation of provinces the province-level divisions are as follows in 2009 parliament approved the creation of two additional provinces hela province consisting of part of the existing southern highlands province and jiwaka province formed by dividing western highlands province jiwaka and hela officially became separate provinces on 17 may 2012 the declaration of hela and jiwaka is a result of the largest liquefied natural gas lng project in the country that is situated in both provinces the government set 15 june 2019 as the voting date for an independence referendum in the bougainville autonomous region the australian strategic policy institute has said that there is a wide expectation bougainville will vote to become independent geography at 462840km 178704sqmi papua new guinea is the worlds fifty-fourth-largest country including all its islands it lies between latitudes 0 and 12s and longitudes 140 and 160e located north of the australian mainland the countrys geography is diverse and in places extremely rugged a spine of mountains the new guinea highlands runs the length of the island of new guinea forming a populous highlands region mostly covered with tropical rainforest and the long papuan peninsula known as the birds tail dense rainforests can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large wetland areas surrounding the sepik and fly rivers this terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure some areas are accessible only on foot or by aeroplane the highest peak is mount wilhelm at 4509 metres 14793ft papua new guinea is surrounded by coral reefs which are under close watch in the interests of preservation the country is situated on the pacific ring of fire at the point of collision of several tectonic plates there are a number of active volcanoes and eruptions are frequent earthquakes are relatively common sometimes accompanied by tsunamis the mainland of the country is the eastern half of new guinea island where the largest towns are also located including port moresby capital and lae other major islands within papua new guinea include new ireland new britain manus and bougainville papua new guinea is one of the few regions close to the equator that experience snowfall which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland borders the border between papua new guinea and indonesia was confirmed by treaty with australia before independence in 1974 the land border comprises a segment of the 141 e meridian from the north coast southwards to where it meets the fly river flowing east then a short curve of the rivers thalweg to where it meets the 1410110 e meridian flowing west then southwards to the south coast the 141 e meridian formed the entire eastern boundary of dutch new guinea according to its 1828 annexation proclamation in 1895 the dutch and british agreed to a territorial exchange bringing the entire left bank of the fly river into british new guinea and moving the southern border east to the torasi estuary the maritime boundary with australia was confirmed by a treaty in 1978 in the torres strait it runs close to the mainland of new guinea keeping the adjacent north western torres strait islands dauan boigu and saibai under australian sovereignty maritime boundaries with the solomon islands were confirmed by a 1989 treaty ecology papua new guinea is part of the australasia ecozone which also includes australia new zealand eastern indonesia and several pacific island groups including the solomon islands and vanuatu geologically the island of new guinea is a northern extension of the indo-australian tectonic plate forming part of a single land mass which is australia-new guinea also called sahul or meganesia it is connected to the australian segment by a shallow continental shelf across the torres strait which in former ages lay exposed as a land bridge particularly during ice ages when sea levels were lower than at present consequently many species of birds and mammals found on new guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in australia one notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of marsupial mammals including some kangaroos and possums which are not found elsewhere papua new guinea is a megadiverse country many of the other islands within png territory including new britain new ireland bougainville the admiralty islands the trobriand islands and the louisiade archipelago were never linked to new guinea by land bridges as a consequence they have their own flora and fauna in particular they lack many of the land mammals and flightless birds that are common to new guinea and australia australia and new guinea are portions of the ancient supercontinent of gondwana which started to break into smaller continents in the cretaceous era 66130 million years ago australia finally broke free from antarctica about 45 million years ago all the australasian lands are home to the antarctic flora descended from the flora of southern gondwana including the coniferous podocarps and araucaria pines and the broadleafed southern beech nothofagus these plant families are still present in papua new guinea as the indo-australian plate which includes landmasses of india australia and the indian ocean floor in between drifts north it collides with the eurasian plate the collision of the two plates pushed up the himalayas the indonesian islands and new guineas central range the central range is much younger and higher than the mountains of australia so high that it is

expedition a small wallaby a large-eared mouse and shrew-like marsupial were discovered the expedition was also successful in capturing photographs and video footage of some other rare animals such as the tenkile tree kangaroo and the weimang tree kangaroo environmental issues at current rates of deforestation more than half of papua new guineas forests could be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 according to a new satellite study of the region nearly one quarter of papua new guineas rainforests were damaged or destroyed between 1972 and 2002 2018 earthquake on february 25 2018 an earthquake of magnitude 75 and depth of 35 kilometres struck the middle of papua new guinea the worst of the damage was centred around the southern highlands region as of march 1 there were 31 reported deaths and that number was expected to rise economy papua new guinea is richly endowed with natural resources including mineral and renewable resources such as forests marine including a large portion of the worlds major tuna stocks and in some parts agriculture the rugged terrainincluding high mountain ranges and valleys swamps and islandsand high cost of developing infrastructure combined with other factors including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title makes it difficult for outside developers local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education health ict and access to finance agriculture for subsistence and cash crops provides a livelihood for 85 of the population and continues to provide some 30 of gdp mineral deposits including gold oil and copper account for 72 of export earnings oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output with palm oil now the main agricultural export in households participating coffee remains the major export crop produced largely in the highlands provinces followed by cocoa and coconut oilcopra from the coastal areas each largely produced by smallholders and tea produced on estates and rubber the iagifuhedinia field was discovered in 1986 in the papuan fold and thrust belt former prime minister sir mekere morauta tried to restore integrity to state institutions stabilise the kina restore stability to the national budget privatise public enterprises where appropriate and ensure ongoing peace on bougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended bougainvilles secessionist unrest the morauta government had considerable success in attracting international support specifically gaining the backing of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in securing development assistance loans significant challenges face prime minister sir michael somare including gaining further investor confidence continuing efforts to privatise government assets and maintaining the support of members of parliament in march 2006 the united nations development programme policy called for papua new guineas designation of developing country to be downgraded to least-developed country because of protracted economic and social stagnation however an evaluation by the imf in late 2008 found that a combination of prudent fiscal and monetary policies and high global prices for mineral commodity exports have underpinned papua new guineas recent buoyant economic growth and macroeconomic stability by 2012 png had enjoyed a decade of positive economic growth at over 6 since 2007 even during the global financial crisis years of 20089 pngs real gdp growth rate as at 2011 was 89 and 92 for 2012 according to the asian development bank this economic growth has been primarily attributed to strong commodity prices particularly mineral but also agricultural with the high demand for mineral products largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant asian markets a booming mining sector and particularly since 2009 by a buoyant outlook and the construction phase for natural gas exploration production and exportation in liquefied form liquefied natural gas or lng by lng tankers lng carrier all of which will require multibillion-dollar investments exploration production wells pipelines storage liquefaction plants port terminals lng tanker ships the first major gas project was the png lng joint venture exxonmobil is operator of the joint venture also comprising png company oil search santos kumul petroleum holdings papua new guineas national oil and gas company jx nippon oil and gas exploration the png governments mineral resources development company and petromin png holdings the project is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facilities in the hela southern highlands and western provinces of papua new guinea including liquefaction and storage facilities located northwest of port moresby with capacity of 69 million tonnes per year there are over 700 kilometres 430mi of pipelines connecting the facilities it is the largest private-sector investment in the history of png a second major project is based on initial rights held by the french oil and gas major total sa and the us company interoil corp ioc which have partly combined their assets after total agreed in december 2013 to purchase 613 of iocs antelope and elk gas field rights with the plan to develop them starting in 2016 including the construction of a liquefaction plant to allow export of lng total sa has separately another joint operating agreement with oil search further gas and mineral projects are proposed including the large wafi-golpu copper-gold mine with extensive exploration ongoing across the country economic development based on the extractive industries carries difficult consequences for local communities there has been much contention around river tailings in the vast fly river submarine tailings from the new ramu-nickel-cobalt mine commencing exports in late 2012 after a delay from landowner-led court challenges and from proposed submarine mining in the bismarck sea by nautilus minerals one major project conducted through the png department for community development suggested that other pathways to sustainable development should be considered the png governments long-term vision 2050 and shorter-term policy documents including the 2013 budget and the 2014 responsible sustainable development strategy emphasise the need for a more diverse economy based upon sustainable industries and avoiding the effects of dutch disease from major resource extraction projects undermining other industries as has occurred in many countries experiencing oil or other mineral booms notably in western africa undermining much of their agriculture sector manufacturing and tourism and with them broad-based employment prospects measures have been taken to mitigate these effects including through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flows but much will depend upon the readiness to make real reforms to effective use of revenue tackling rampant corruption and empowering households and businesses to access markets services and develop a more buoyant economy with lower costs especially for small to medium-size enterprises the institute of national affairs a png independent policy think tank provides a report on the business and investment environment of papua new guinea every five years based upon a survey of large and small local and overseas companies highlighting law and order problems and corruption as the worst impediments followed by the poor state of transport power and communications infrastructure land tenure the png legislature has enacted laws in which a type of tenure called customary land title is recognised meaning that the traditional lands of the indigenous peoples have some legal basis to inalienable tenure this customary land notionally covers most of the usable land in the country some 97 of total land area alienated land is either held privately under state lease or is government land freehold title also known as fee simple can only be held by papua new guinean citizens only some 3 of the land of papua new guinea is in private hands this is privately held under 99-year state lease or it is held by the state there is virtually no freehold title the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners the precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to another many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans however closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died this is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners customary propertyusually landcannot be devised by will it can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceaseds people the lands act was amended in 2010 along with the land group incorporation act intended to improve the management of state land mechanisms for dispute resolution over land and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities the land group incorporation act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined a major issue in recent years has been a land grab using or rather misusing the lease-leaseback provision under the land act notably using special agricultural and business leases sabls to acquire vast tracts of customary land purportedly for agricultural projects but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for loggingcircumventing the more exacting requirements of the forest act for securing timber permits which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured and with the customary landowners approval following a national outcry these sabls have been subject to a commission of inquiry established in mid-2011 for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the prime minister and parliament demographics papua new guinea is one of the most heterogeneous nations in the world there are hundreds of ethnic groups indigenous to papua new guinea the majority being from the group known as papuans whose ancestors arrived in the new guinea region tens of thousands of years ago the other indigenous peoples are austronesians their ancestors having arrived in the region less than four thousand years ago there are also numerous people from other parts of the world now resident including chinese europeans australians indonesians filipinos polynesians and micronesians the last four belonging to the austronesian family around 40000 expatriates mostly from australia and china were living in papua new guinea in 1975 urbanisation languages papua new guinea has more languages than any other country with over 820 indigenous languages representing 12 of the worlds total but most have fewer than 1000 speakers the most widely spoken indigenous language is enga with about 200000 speakers followed by melpa and huli indigenous languages are classified into two large groups austronesian languages and non-austronesian or papuan languages there are four official languages in papua new guinea english sign language which in practice means papua new guinean sign language tok pisin and hiri motu english is the language of government and the education system but it is not spoken widely the primary lingua franca of the country is tok pisin commonly known in english as new guinean pidgin or melanesian pidgin in which much of the debate in parliament is conducted many information campaigns and advertisements are presented and until recently a national newspaper wantok was published the only area where tok pisin is not prevalent is the southern region of papua where people often use the third official language hiri motu although it lies in the papua region port moresby has a highly diverse population which primarily uses tok pisin and to a lesser extent english with motu spoken as the indigenous language in outlying villages with an average of only 7000 speakers per language papua new guinea has a greater density of languages than any other nation on earth except vanuatu health see health in papua new guinea religion citizen population in papua new guinea by religion based on the 2011 census the courts and government practice uphold the constitutional right to freedom of speech thought and belief and no legislation to curb those rights has been adopted the 2011 census found that 956 of citizens identified themselves as members of a christian church 14 were not christian 31 did not answer this census question these who stated no religion accounted for approximately 0 many citizens combine their christian faith with some traditional indigenous religious practices christianity in papua new guinea is predominantly made up of protestants who collectively constitute roughly 70 of the total population they are mostly represented by the evangelical lutheran church of papua new guinea the seventh-day adventist church diverse pentecostal denominations the united church in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the evangelical alliance papua new guinea and the anglican church of papua
