samuel de champlain frenchsamyl d pl also known in english as samuel champlain about august 13 1567 december 25 1635 was a french colonist navigator cartographer draftsman soldier explorer geographer ethnologist diplomat and chronicler he made between 21 and 29 trips across the atlantic ocean and founded new france and quebec city on july 3 1608 an important figure in canadian history champlain created the first accurate coastal map during his explorations and founded various colonial settlements born into a family of mariners champlain while still a young boy began exploring north america in 1603 under the guidance of his uncle franois grav du pont from 1604 to 1607 he participated in the exploration and settlement of the first permanent european settlement north of florida port royal acadia 1605 as well as the first european settlement that would become saint john new brunswick 1604 in 1608 he established the french settlement that is now quebec city canada champlain was the first european to explore and describe the great lakes and published maps of his journeys and accounts of what he learned from the natives and the french living among the natives he formed relationships with local montagnais and innu and later with others farther west of the ottawa river lake nipissing and georgian bay with algonquin and wendat and agreed to provide assistance in the beaver wars against the iroquois in 1620 louis xiii of france ordered champlain to cease exploration return to quebec and devote himself to the administration of the country in every way but formal title samuel de champlain served as governor of new france a title that may have been formally unavailable to him owing to his non-noble status he established trading companies that sent goods primarily fur to france and oversaw the growth of new france in the st lawrence river valley until his death in 1635 champlain is memorialized as the father of new france and father of acadia with many places streets and structures in northeastern north america bearing his name most notably lake champlain birth year location and family champlain was born to antoine champlain also written anthoine chappelain in some records and marguerite le roy in either hiers-brouage or the port city of la rochelle in the french province of aunis he was born on or before august 13 1574 according to a recent baptism record found by jean-marie germe french genealogist although in 1870 the canadian catholic priest laverdire in the first chapter of his uvres de champlain accepted pierre-damien rainguets estimate and tried to justify it his calculations were based on assumptions now believed or proven to be incorrect although lopold delayant member secretary then president of lacadmie des belles-lettres sciences et arts de la rochelle wrote as early as 1867 that rainguets estimate was wrong the books of rainguet and laverdire have had a significant influence the 1567 date was carved on numerous monuments dedicated to champlain and is widely regarded as accurate in the first half of the 20th century some authors disagreed choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567 in 1978 jean liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of champlains birth year and concluded samuel champlain was born about 1580 in brouage france liebel asserts that some authors including the catholic priests rainguet and laverdire preferred years when brouage was under catholic control which include 1567 1570 and 1575 champlain claimed to be from brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be saintongeois in the title of his second book 1613 he belonged to either a protestant family or a tolerant roman catholic one since brouage was most of the time a catholic city in a protestant region and his old testament first name samuel was not usually given to catholic children the exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty but at the time of his birth his parents were living in brouage born into a family of mariners both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors or navigators samuel champlain learned to navigate draw make nautical charts and write practical reports his education did not include ancient greek or latin so he did not read or learn from any ancient literature as each french fleet had to assure its own defense at sea champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of king henry iv during the later stages of frances religious wars in brittany from 1594 or 1595 to 1598 beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses during this time he claimed to go on a certain secret voyage for the king and saw combat including maybe the siege of fort crozon at the end of 1594 by 1597 he was a capitaine dune compagnie serving in a garrison near quimper early travels in 1598 his uncle-in-law a navigator whose ship saint-julien was chartered to transport spanish troops to cdiz pursuant to the treaty of vervins gave champlain the opportunity to accompany him after a difficult passage he spent some time in cadiz before his uncle whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large spanish fleet to the west indies again offered him a place on the ship his uncle who gave command of the ship to jeronimo de valaebrera instructed the young champlain to watch over the ship this journey lasted two years and gave champlain the opportunity to see or hear about spanish holdings from the caribbean to mexico city along the way he took detailed notes and wrote an illustrated report on what he learned on this trip and gave this secret report to king henry who rewarded champlain with an annual pension this report was published for the first time in 1870 by laverdire as brief discours des choses plus remarquables que sammuel champlain de brouage a reconneues aux indes occidentalles au voiage quil en a faict en icettes en lanne 1599 et en lanne 1601 comme ensuite and in english as narrative of a voyage to the west indies and mexico 15991602 the authenticity of this account as a work written by champlain has frequently been questioned due to inaccuracies and discrepancies with other sources on a number of points however recent scholarship indicates that the work probably was authored by champlain on champlains return to cadiz in august 1600 his uncle who had fallen ill asked him to look after his business affairs this champlain did and when his uncle died in june 1601 champlain inherited his substantial estate it included an estate near la rochelle commercial properties in spain and a 150-ton merchant ship this inheritance combined with the kings annual pension gave the young explorer a great deal of independence as he was not dependent on the financial backing of merchants and other investors from 1601 to 1603 champlain served as a geographer in the court of king henry iv as part of his duties he traveled to french ports and learned much about north america from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from nantucket to newfoundland to capitalize on the rich fishing grounds there he also made a study of previous french failures at colonization in the area including that of pierre de chauvin at tadoussac when chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in north america in 1602 responsibility for renewing the trade was given to aymar de chaste champlain approached de chaste about a position on the first voyage which he received with the kings assent champlains first trip to north america was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by franois grav du pont du pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ships captain on chauvins expedition and with whom champlain established a firm lifelong friendship he educated champlain about navigation in north america including the saint lawrence river and in dealing with the natives there and in acadia after the bonne-renomme the good fame arrived at tadoussac on march 15 1603 champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that jacques cartier had seen and described about sixty years earlier and wanted to go even further than cartier if possible champlain created a map of the saint lawrence on this trip and after his return to france on september 20 published an account as des sauvages ou voyage de samuel champlain de brouages faite en la france nouvelle lan 1603 concerning the savages or travels of samuel champlain of brouages made in new france in the year 1603 included in his account were meetings with begourat a chief of the montagnais at tadoussac in which positive relationships were established between the french and the many montagnais gathered there with some algonquin friends promising to king henry to report on further discoveries champlain joined a second expedition to new france in the spring of 1604 this trip once again an exploratory journey without women and children lasted several years and focused on areas south of the st lawrence river in what later became known as acadia it was led by pierre dugua de mons a noble and protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in new france by the king dugua asked champlain to find a site for winter settlement after exploring possible sites in the bay of fundy champlain selected saint croix island in the st croix river as the site of the expeditions first winter settlement after enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established port royal until 1607 champlain used that site as his base while he explored the atlantic coast dugua was forced to leave the settlement for france in september 1605 because he learned that his monopoly was at risk his monopoly was rescinded by the king in july 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade leading to the abandonment of the settlement in 1605 and 1606 champlain explored the north american coast as far south as cape cod searching for sites for a permanent settlement minor skirmishes with the resident nausets dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day chatham massachusetts he named the area mallebar bad bar founding of quebec city in the spring of 1608 dugua wanted champlain to start a new french colony and fur trading center on the shores of the st lawrence dugua equipped at his own expense a fleet of three ships with workers that left the french port of honfleur the main ship called the don-de-dieu french for the gift of god was commanded by champlain another ship the lvrier the hunt dog was commanded by his friend du pont the small group of male settlers arrived at tadoussac on the lower st lawrence in june because of the dangerous strength of the saguenay river ending there they left the ships and continued up the big river in small boats bringing the men and the materials on july 3 1608 champlain landed at the point of quebec and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings each two stories tall that he collectively called the habitation with a wooden stockade and a moat 12 feet 4m wide surrounding them this was the very beginning of quebec city gardening exploring and fortifying this place became great passions of champlain for the rest of his life in the 1620s the habitation at quebec was mainly a store for the compagnie des marchands traders company and champlain lived in the wooden fort saint louis newly built up the hill south from the present-day chteau frontenac hotel near the only two houses built by the two settler families the ones of louis hbert and guillaume couillard his son-in-law marriage one route champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old hlne boull she was the daughter of nicolas boull a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court the marriage contract was signed on december 27 1610 in presence of dugua who had dealt with the father and the couple was married three days later the terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later champlain sought permission from her parents to consummate the marriage before that many of those who entered into such relationships such as samuel de champlain d 1635 the first governor of french canada agreed that they would not have sex with a 12-year-old bride until she was 14 as champlain did unless he consulted with her family and received their permission to do so earlier apparently he did champlains marriage was initially quite troubled as hlne rallied against joining him in august 1613 their relationship while it apparently lacked any physical connection recovered and was apparently good for many years hlne lived in quebec for several years but returned to paris and eventually decided to enter a convent the couple had no children although champlain did adopt three montagnais girls named faith hope and charity in the winter of 162728 relations and war with native americans during the summer of 1609 champlain attempted to form better relations with the local native tribes he made alliances with the wendat derogatorily called huron by the french and with the algonquin the montagnais and the etchemin who lived in the area of the st lawrence river these tribes demanded that champlain help them in their war against the iroquois who lived farther south champlain set off with nine french soldiers and 300 natives to explore the rivire des iroquois now known as the richelieu river and became the first european to map lake champlain having had no encounters with the haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back leaving champlain with only 2 frenchmen and 60 natives on july 29 somewhere in the area near ticonderoga and crown point new york historians are not sure which of these two places but fort ticonderoga historians claim that it occurred near its site champlain and his party encountered a group of haudenosaunee in a battle that began the next day two hundred and fifty haudenosaunee advanced on champlains position and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs in his account of the battle champlain recounts firing his arquebus and killing two of them with a single shot after which one of his men killed the third the haudenosaunee turned and fled this action set the tone for poor french-iroquois relations for the rest of the century the battle of sorel occurred on june 19 1610 with samuel de champlain supported by the kingdom of france and his allies the wendat people algonquin people and innu people against the mohawk people in new france at present-day sorel-tracy quebec champlains forces armed with the arquebus engaged and slaughtered or captured nearly all of the mohawks the battle ended major hostilities with the mohawks for twenty years exploration of new france on march 29 1613 arriving back in new france he first ensured that his new royal commission be proclaimed champlain set out on may 27 to continue his exploration of the huron country and in hopes of finding the northern sea he had heard about probably hudson bay he traveled the ottawa river later giving the first description of this area along the way he apparently dropped or left behind a cache of silver cups copper kettles and a brass astrolabe dated 1603 champlains astrolabe which was later found by a farm boy named edward lee near cobden ontario it was in june that he met with tessouat the algonquin chief of allumettes island and offered to build the tribe a fort if they were to move from the area they occupied with its poor soil to the locality of the lachine rapids by august 26 champlain was back in saint-malo there he wrote an account of his life from 1604 to 1612 and his journey up the ottawa river his voyages and published another map of new france in 1614 he formed the compagnie des marchands de rouen et de saint-malo and compagnie de champlain which bound the rouen and saint-malo merchants for eleven years he returned to new france in the spring of 1615 with four recollects in order to further religious life in the new colony the roman catholic church was eventually given en seigneurie large and valuable tracts of land estimated at nearly 30 of all the lands granted by the french crown in new france champlain continued to work to improve relations with the natives promising to help them in their struggles against the iroquois with his native guides he explored further up the ottawa river and reached lake nipissing he then followed the french river until he reached the freshwater sea he called lac attigouautau now lake huron in 1615 champlain was escorted through the area that is now peterborough ontario by a group of wendat he used the ancient portage between chemong lake and little lake now chemong road and stayed for a short period of time near what is now bridgenorth military expedition on september 1 1615 at cahiagu a wendat community on what is now called lake simcoe he and the northern tribes started a military expedition against the iroquois the party passed lake ontario at its eastern tip where they hid their canoes and continued their journey by land they followed the oneida river until they arrived at the main onondaga fort on october 10 the exact location of this place is still a matter of debate although the traditional location nichols pond is regularly disproved by professional and amateur archaeologists many still claim that nichols pond is the location of the battle 10 miles 16km south of canastota new york champlain attacked the stockaded oneida village he was accompanied by 10 frenchmen and 300 wendat pressured by the huron wendat to attack prematurely the assault failed champlain was wounded twice in the leg by arrows one in his knee the conflict ended on october 16 when the french wendat were forced to flee although he did not want to the wendat insisted that champlain spend the winter with them during his stay he set off with them in their great deer hunt during which he became lost and was forced to wander for three days living off game and sleeping under trees until he met up with a band of first nations people by chance he spent the rest of the winter learning their country their manners customs modes of life on may 22 1616 he left the wendat country and returned to quebec before heading back to france on july 2 improving administration in new france champlain returned to new france in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration champlain spent the winter building fort saint-louis on top of cape diamond by mid-may he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the caen brothers after some tense negotiations it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the caens champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice he also negotiated a peace treaty with the iroquois champlain continued to work on the fortifications of what became quebec city laying the first stone on may 6 1624 on august 15 he once again returned to france where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to china something widely believed to exist at the time by july 5 he was back at quebec and continued expanding the city in 1627 the caen brothers company lost its monopoly on the fur trade and cardinal richelieu who had joined the royal council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in french politics that he would hold until his death in 1642 formed the compagnie des cent-associs the hundred associates to manage the fur trade champlain was one of the 100 investors and its first fleet loaded with colonists and supplies set sail in april 1628 champlain had overwintered in quebec supplies were low and english merchants pillaged cap tourmente in early july 1628 a war had broken out between france and england and charles i of england had issued letters of marque that authorized the capture of french shipping and its colonies in north america champlain received a summons to surrender on july 10 from some heavily armed english based scottish merchants the kirke brothers champlain refused to deal with them misleading them to believe that quebecs defenses were better than they actually were champlain had only 50 pounds of gunpowder to defend the community successfully bluffed they withdrew but encountered and captured the french supply fleet cutting off that years supplies to the colony by the spring of 1629 supplies were dangerously low and champlain was forced to send people to gasp and into indian communities to conserve rations on july 19 the kirke brothers arrived before quebec after intercepting champlains plea for help and champlain was forced to surrender the colony many colonists were taken first to england and then to france by the kirkes but champlain remained in london to begin the process of regaining the colony a peace treaty had been signed in april 1629 three months before the surrender and under the terms of that treaty quebec and other prizes were taken by the kirkes after the treaty was supposed to be returned it was not until the 1632 treaty of saint-germain-en-laye that quebec was formally given back to france david kirke was rewarded when charles i knighted him and gave him a charter for newfoundland champlain reclaimed his role as commander of new france on behalf of richelieu on march 1 1633 having served in the intervening years as commander in new france in the absence of my lord the cardinal de richelieu from 1629 to 1635 in 1632 champlain published voyages de la nouvelle france which was dedicated to cardinal richelieu and traitt de la marine et du devoir dun bon marinier a treatise on leadership seamanship and navigation champlain made more than twenty-five round-trip crossings of the atlantic in his lifetime without losing a single ship last return and last years working in quebec champlain returned to quebec on may 22 1633 after an absence of four years richelieu gave him a commission as lieutenant general of new france along with other titles and responsibilities but not that of governor despite this lack of formal status many colonists french merchants and indians treated him as if he had the title writings survive in which he is referred to as our governor on august 18 1634 he sent a report to richelieu stating that he had rebuilt on the ruins of quebec enlarged its fortifications and established two more habitations one was 15 leagues upstream and the other was at trois-rivires he also began an offensive against the iroquois reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or brought to reason death and burial champlain had a severe stroke in october 1635 and died on december 25 leaving no immediate heirs jesuit records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor charles lallemant although his will drafted in november 17 1635 gave much of his french property to his wife hlne he made significant bequests to the catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of quebec however marie camaret a cousin on his mothers side challenged the will in paris and had it successfully overturned it is unclear exactly what happened to his estate samuel de champlain was temporarily buried in the church while a standalone chapel was built to hold his remains in the upper part of the city unfortunately this small building along with many others was destroyed by a large fire in 1640 though immediately rebuilt no traces of it exist anymore his exact burial site is still unknown despite much research since about 1850 including several archaeological digs in the city there is general agreement that the previous champlain chapel site and the remains of champlain should be somewhere near the notre-dame de qubec cathedral the search for champlains remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer louise pennys 2010 novel bury your dead legacy many sites and landmarks have been named to honour champlain who was a prominent figure in many parts of acadia ontario quebec new york and vermont
