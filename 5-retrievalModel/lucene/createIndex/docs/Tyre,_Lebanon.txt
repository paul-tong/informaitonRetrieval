top of page right is still in use in ancient times the island-city of tyre was heavily fortified and the mainland settlement originally called ushu later called palaetyrus meaning old tyre by the ancient greeks was actually more like a line of suburbs than any one city and was used primarily as a source of water and timber for the main island city josephus records that the two fought against each other on occasion but most of the time they supported one another because they both benefited from the island citys wealth from maritime trade and the mainland areas source of timber water and

israel as the first and second tyre catastrophes the 1983 explosion by a suicide truck happened only 10 days after similar attacks the 1983 beirut barracks bombings of us marines and french paratroop

cultural heritage include development pressures and the illegal antiquities trade a highway planned for 2011 was expected to be built in areas that are deemed archaeologically sensitive a small-scale geophysical survey indicated the presence of archaeological remains at proposed construction sites the sites have not been investigated despite the relocation of a proposed traffic interchange the lack of precise site boundaries confuses the issue of site preservation the hostilities of the 2006 lebanon war put the ancient structures of tyre at risk this prompted unescos director-general to launch a heritage alert for the site following the cessation of hostilities in september 2006 a visit by conservation experts to lebanon observed no direct damage to the ancient city of tyre however bombardment had damaged frescoes in a roman funerary cave at the tyre necropolis additional site degradation was also noted including the lack of maintenance the decay of exposed structures due to lack of rainwater regulation and the decay of porous and soft stones like many of the cities in the levant and in lebanon the architecture since the lebanese civil war in the 1970s has been of poor quality which tend to threaten the cultural heritage in the built environment before the war scriptural the bible makes several references to tyre according to joshua 1929 tyre is referred to as a
