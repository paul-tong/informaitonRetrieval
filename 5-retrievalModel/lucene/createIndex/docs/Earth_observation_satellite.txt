earth observation satellites or earth remote sensing satellites are satellites specifically designed for earth observation from orbit similar to spy satellites but intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc the first occurrence of satellite remote sensing can be dated to the launch of the first artificial satellite sputnik 1 by the soviet union on october 4 1957 sputnik 1 sent back radio signals which scientists used to study the ionosphere nasa launched the first american satellite explorer 1 in january 31 1958 the information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the earths van allen radiation belts the tiros-1 spacecraft launched on april 1 1960 as part of nasas tiros television infrared observation satellite program sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space as of 2008 more than 150 earth observation satellites were in orbit recording data with both passive and active sensors and acquiring more than 10 terabits of data daily most earth observation satellites carry instruments that should be operated at a relatively low altitude altitudes below 500-600 kilometers are in general avoided though because of the significant air-drag at such low altitudes making frequent orbit reboost maneuvres necessary the earth observation satellites ers-1 ers-2 and envisat of european space agency as well as the metop spacecraft of eumetsat are all operated at altitudes of about 800km the proba-1 proba-2 and smos spacecraft of european space agency are observing the earth from an altitude of about 700km the earth observation satellites of uae dubaisat-1 dubaisat-2 are also placed in low earth orbits leo orbits and providing satellite imagery of various parts of the earth to get nearly global coverage with a low orbit it must be a polar orbit or nearly so a low orbit will have an orbital period of roughly 100 minutes and the earth will rotate around its polar axis with about 25 deg between successive orbits with the result that the ground track is shifted towards west with these 25 deg in longitude most are in sun-synchronous orbits spacecraft carrying instruments for which an altitude of 36000km is suitable sometimes use a geostationary orbit such an orbit allows uninterrupted coverage of more than 13 of the earth three geostationary spacecraft at longitudes separated with 120 deg can cover the whole earth except the extreme polar regions this type of orbit is mainly used for meteorological satellites history herman potonik explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book the problem of space travel he described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments the book described geostationary satellites first put forward by konstantin tsiolkovsky and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays weather a weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the earth these meteorological satellites however see more than clouds and cloud systems city lights fires effects of pollution auroras sand and dust storms snow cover ice mapping boundaries of ocean currents energy flows etc are other types of environmental information collected using weather satellites weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from mount st helens and activity from other volcanoes such as mount etna smoke from fires environmental monitoring other environmental satellites can assist environmental monitoring by detecting changes in the earths vegetation atmospheric trace gas content sea state ocean color and ice fields by monitoring vegetation changes over time droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average for example the 2002 oil spill off the northwest coast of spain was watched carefully by the european envisat which though not a weather satellite flies an instrument asar which can see changes in the sea surface anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric no2 and so2 these types of satellites are almost always in sun synchronous and frozen orbits the sun synchronous orbit is in general sufficiently close to polar to get the desired global coverage while the relatively constant geometry to the sun mostly is an advantage for the instruments the frozen orbit is selected as this is the closest to a circular orbit that is possible in the gravitational field of the earth mapping terrain can be mapped from space with the use of satellites such as radarsat-1 and terrasar-x see also earth observation earth observation satellites transmission frequencies earth observing system -
