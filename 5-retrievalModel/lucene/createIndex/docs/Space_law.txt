space law is the body of law governing space-related activities encompassing both international and domestic agreements rules and principles parameters of space law include space exploration liability for damage weapons use rescue efforts environmental preservation information sharing new technologies and ethics other fields of law such as administrative law intellectual property law arms control law insurance law environmental law criminal law and commercial law are also integrated within space law the origins of space law date back to 1919 with international law recognizing each countrys sovereignty over the airspace directly above their territory later reinforced at the chicago convention in 1954 the onset of domestic space programs during the cold war propelled the official creation of international space policy ie the international geophysical year initiated by the international council of scientific unions the soviet unions 1957 launch of the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 directly spurred the united states congress to pass the space act thus creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa because space exploration required crossing transnational boundaries it was during this era where space law became a field independent from traditional aerospace law since the cold war the treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies the outer space treaty and the international telecommunications union have served as the foundational legal framework and set of principles and procedures constituting space law further the united nations committee on peaceful uses of outer space along with its the office for outer space affairs subcommittee aid in governing international space law and policy challenges that space law will continue to face in the future are fourfoldspanning across dimensions of domestic compliance international cooperation ethics and the advent of scientific innovations furthermore specific guidelines on the definition of airspace have yet to be universally determined early developments at caltech in 1942 theodore von krmn and other rocket scientists banded together to form aerojet rocket company with the help of lawyer andrew g haley to toast the new corporation krmn said now andy we will make the rockets you must make the corporation and obtain the money later on you will have to see that we behave well in outer spaceafter all we are the scientists but you are the lawyer and you must tell us how to behave ourselves according to law and to safeguard our innocence indeed twenty years later haley published the fundamental textbook space law and government beginning in 1957 with the space race nations began discussing systems to ensure the peaceful use of outer space bilateral discussions between the united states and ussr in 1958 resulted in the presentation of issues to the un for debate in 1959 the un created the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space copuos copuos in turn created two subcommittees the scientific and technical subcommittee and the legal subcommittee the copuos legal subcommittee has been a primary forum for discussion and negotiation of international agreements relating to outer space in 1960 the international astronautical congress met in stockholm and heard several submissions including a survey of legal opinion on extraterrestrial jurisdiction by andrew g haley in 1963 yale university press published law and public order in space by myres mcdougal harold lasswell and ivan vlasic international treaties five international treaties have been negotiated and drafted in the copuos the 1967 treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies the outer space treaty the 1968 agreement on the rescue of astronauts the return of astronauts and the return of objects launched into outer space the rescue agreement the 1972 convention on international liability for damage caused by space objects the liability convention the 1975 convention on registration of objects launched into outer space the registration convention the 1979 agreement governing the activities of states on the moon and other celestial bodies the moon treaty the outer space treaty is the most widely adopted treaty with 104 parties the rescue agreement the liability convention and the registration convention all elaborate on provisions of the outer space treaty un delegates apparently intended that the moon treaty serve as a new comprehensive treaty which would supersede or supplement the outer space treaty most notably by elaborating upon the outer space treatys provisions regarding resource appropriation and prohibition of territorial sovereignty the moon treaty has only 17 parties however and many consider it to be a failed treaty due to its limited acceptance india is the only nation that has both signed the moon treaty and declared itself interested in going to the moon india has not ratified the treaty an analysis of indias treaty law is required to understand how this affects india legally in addition the 1963 treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere in outer space and under water partial test ban treaty banned the testing of nuclear weapons in outer space international principles and declarations the five treaties and agreements of international space law cover non-appropriation of outer space by any one country arms control the freedom of exploration liability for damage caused by space objects the safety and rescue of spacecraft and astronauts the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment the notification and registration of space activities scientific investigation and the exploitation of natural resources in outer space and the settlement of disputes the united nations general assembly adopted five declarations and legal principles which encourage exercising the international laws as well as unified communication between countries the five declarations and principles are the declaration of legal principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and uses of outer space 1963 agreement governing the activities of states on the moon and other celestial bodies 1979 apollo 15 moon landing jul 26 1971 aug 7 1971 the agreement exists to promote the exploration of outer space but to keep the moon and other celestial bodies in pristine conditions for the common heritage of man meaning that no nation may claim sovereignty over any part of space all countries should have equal rights to conduct research on the moon or other celestial bodies weapons of mass destruction of any kind including nuclear and bases built for military purposes are specifically banned by the treaty the united nations resolution also states that all state parties may conduct their enterprises below the surface of the moon or any celestial body so long as efforts are made to protect it from contamination all activities in space are required to be attached to a nation and any damages to other nations equipment or facilities caused by another party must be repaid in full to that nation any discovery of a dangerous hazard such as an area that is radioactive must notify the united nations secretary general and the greater international scientific community immediately the principles governing the use by states of artificial earth satellites for international direct television broadcasting 1982 the principles relating to remote sensing of the earth from outer space 1986 the principles relevant to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space 1992 the declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for the benefit and in the interest of all states taking into particular account the needs of developing countries 1996 consensus the united nations committee on the peaceful uses of outer space and its scientific and technical and legal subcommittees operate on the basis of consensus ie all delegations from member states must agree on any matter be it treaty language before it can be included in the final version of a treaty or new items on committeesubcommittees agendas one reason that the un space treaties lack definitions and are unclear in other respects is that it is easier to achieve consensus when language and terms are vague in recent years the legal subcommittee has been unable to achieve consensus on discussion of a new comprehensive space agreement the idea of which though was proposed just by a few member states it is also unlikely that the subcommittee will be able to agree to amend the outer space treaty in the foreseeable future many space faring nations seem to believe that discussing a new space agreement or amendment of the outer space treaty would be futile and time-consuming because entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation property rights and other issues relating to commercial activity make consensus unlikely 1998 iss agreement in addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the united nations the nations participating in the international space station have entered into the 1998 agreement among the governments of canada member states of the european space agency japan russian federation and the united states concerning cooperation on the civil international space station this agreement provides among other things that nasa is the lead agency in coordinating the member states contributions to and activities on the space station and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own modules the agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution this agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the moon and mars where the first off-world colonies and scientificindustrial bases are likely to be established national law space law also encompasses national laws and many countries have passed national space legislation in recent years the outer space treaty gives responsibility for regulating space activities including both government and private sector to the individual countries where the activity is taking place if a national of or an organization incorporated in one country launches a spacecraft in a different country interpretations differ as to whether the home country or the launching country has jurisdiction the outer space treaty also incorporates the un charter by reference and requires parties to ensure that activities are conducted in accordance with other forms of international law such as customary international law the custom and practice of states the advent of commercial activities like space mining space tourism private exploration and the development of many commercial spaceports is leading many countries to consider how to regulate private space activities the challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law the developing nations are concerned that the spacefaring nations will monopolize space resources royalties paid to developing countries is one reason the united states has not ratified the united nations convention on the law of the sea and why some oppose applying the same principles to outer space several nations have recently updated their statutory space law among them luxembourg in 2017 the united states in 2015 and japan with the basic space law in 2008 due to the expansion of the domain of space research and allied activities in india the draft space activities bill was introduced in the year 2017 geostationary orbit allocation allocative limitations objects in geostationary orbits remain stationary over a point on the earth due to gravity there are numerous advantages in being able to use these orbits mostly due to the unique ability to send radio frequencies to and from satellites to collect data and send signals to various locations the united nations committee on peaceful uses of outer space has approved seven nonmilitary uses for these orbits communications meteorology earth resources and environment navigation and aircraft control testing of new systems astronomy and data relay the requirement to space these satellites apart means that there is a limited number of orbital slots available thus only a limited number of satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit this has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots countries at the same longitude but differing latitudes these disputes are addressed through the itu allocation mechanism countries located at the earths equator have also asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory notably in 1976 when many countries located at the earths equator created the bogota declaration in which they asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory political controversy future developments using geostationary orbits may include an expansion of services in telecommunication broadcasting and meteorology as a result uses for geostationary orbits may stir political controversy for example broadcasting and telecommunication services of satellites orbiting above earth from certain nations may accidentally spill over into other nations territory this may prompt conflict with nations that wish to restrict access to information and communication current and future political and legal concerns allocation may pose may be addressed by international legislatures such as the united nations committee on the peaceful uses of outer space and the international telecommunication union ethics ethics can be defined as the task of being human in space law ethics extend to topics regarding space exploration space tourism space ownership the militarization of space environmental protection and distinguishing the boundaries of space itself commercial use early discussions regarding space ethics revolved around whether or not the space frontier should be available for use gaining prominence at the time of the soviet union and united states space race in 1967 the outer space treaty dictated that all nations in compliance with international regulation is permitted to exploit space as a result the commercial use of space is open to exploitation by public and private entities especially in relation to mining and space tourism this principle has been the subject of controversy particularly by those in favor of environmental protection sustainability and conservation environmental protection more recent discussions focus on the need for the international community to draft and institute a code of space ethics to prevent the destruction of the space environment furthermore the advancement of life in space pertain to questions related to the ethics of biocentrism and anthropocentrism or in other words determining how much value we place in all living things versus human beings specifically currently researchers in the bioengineering field are working towards contamination control measures integrated into spacecrafts to protect both space and earths biosphere defining space many ethical questions arise from the difficulty of defining the term space scholars not only debate its geographical definition ie upper and lower limits but also whether or not it also encompasses various objects within it ie celestial objects human beings man-made devices lower limits are generally estimated to be about 50 kilometers more difficulties arise trying to define the upper bounds of space as it would require more inquiry into the nature of the universe and the role of earth along with within it future developments exploitation while this field of the law is still in its infancy it is in an era of rapid change and development arguably the resources of space are infinite if commercial space transportation becomes widely available with substantially lower launch costs then all countries will be able to directly reap the benefits of space resources in that situation it seems likely that consensus will be much easier to achieve with respect to commercial development and human settlement of outer space high costs are not the only factor preventing the economic exploitation of space it is argued that space should be considered as a pristine environment worthy of protection and conservation and that the legal regime for space should further protect it from being used as a resource for earths needs debate is also focused on whether space should continue to be legally defined as part of the common heritage of man and therefore unavailable for national claims or whether its legal definition should be changed to allow private property in space as of 2013 nasas plans to capture an asteroid by 2021 has raised questions about how space law would be applied in practice in 2016 the nation of luxembourg has set out a formal legal framework which ensures that private companies engaged in mining resources in space have rights to those resources legal profession michael dodge of long beach mississippi was the first law school graduate to receive a space law certificate in the united states
