zhang heng chinese ad 78139 formerly romanized as chang heng was a han chinese polymath from nanyang who lived during the han dynasty educated in the capital cities of luoyang and changan he achieved success as an astronomer mathematician scientist engineer inventor geographer cartographer artist poet statesman and literary scholar zhang heng began his career as a minor civil servant in nanyang eventually he became chief astronomer prefect of the majors for official carriages and then palace attendant at the imperial court his uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure preventing him from rising to the status of grand historian his political rivalry with the palace eunuchs during the reign of emperor shun r125144 led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of hejian in hebei zhang returned home to nanyang for a short time before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138 he died there a year later in 139 zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions he invented the worlds first water-powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank and invented the worlds first seismoscope which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake 500km 310mi away he improved previous chinese calculations for pi in addition to documenting about 2500 stars in his extensive star catalog zhang also posited theories about the moon and its relationship to the sun specifically he discussed the moons sphericity its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the hidden nature of the other and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses his fu rhapsody and shi poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later chinese writers zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the greco-roman ptolemy ad86161 life early life born in the town of xie in nanyang commandery north of the modern nanyang city in henan province zhang heng came from a distinguished but not very affluent family his grandfather zhang kan had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the han by emperor guangwu r2557 following the death of the usurping wang mang of the xin ad923 when he was ten zhangs father died leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother an accomplished writer in his youth zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of changan and luoyang while traveling to luoyang zhang passed by a hot spring near mount li and dedicated one of his earliest fu poems to it this work entitled fu on the hot springs wnqun f describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs which later became famous as the huaqing hot springs a favorite retreat of imperial concubine yang guifei during the tang dynasty after studying for some years at luoyangs taixue he was well-versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons including the mathematician and calligrapher cui yuan 78143 the official and philosophical commentator ma rong 79166 and the philosopher wang fu 78163 government authorities offered zhang appointments to several offices including a position as one of the imperial secretaries yet he acted modestly and declined at age twenty-three he returned home with the title officer of merit in nanyang serving as the master of documents under the administration of governor bao de in office from 103111 as he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor he gained experience in writing official documents as officer of merit in the commandery he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office he spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities when bao de was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance zhang continued his literary work at home in xie zhang heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics official career in 112 zhang was summoned to the court of emperor an r106125 who had heard of his expertise in mathematics when he was nominated to serve at the capital zhang was escorted by carriagea symbol of his official statusto luoyang where he became a court gentleman working for the imperial secretariat he was promoted to chief astronomer for the court serving his first term from 115120 under emperor an and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126132 as chief astronomer zhang was a subordinate of the minister of ceremonies one of nine ministers ranked just below the three excellencies in addition to recording heavenly observations and portents preparing the calendar and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the imperial secretariat and the censorate both of whose members were required to know at least 9000 characters and all major writing styles under emperor an zhang also served as prefect of the majors for official carriages under the ministry of guards in charge of receiving memorials to the throne formal essays on policy and administration as well as nominees for official appointments when the government official dan song proposed the chinese calendar should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain apocryphal teachings zhang opposed the idea he considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors others shared zhangs opinion and the calendar was not altered yet zhangs proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected the officials liu zhen and liu taotu members of a committee to compile the dynastic history dongguan hanji sought permission from the court to consult zhang heng however zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of gengshi emperors r2325 role in the restoration of the han dynasty as lesser than emperor guangwus liu zhen and liu taotu were zhangs only historian allies at court and after their deaths zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian despite this setback in his official career zhang was reappointed as chief astronomer in 126 after emperor shun of han r 125144 ascended to the throne his intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600bushels or shi of grain mostly commuted to coin cash or bolts of silk to place this number in context in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10000bushels during the han the 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank in 132 zhang introduced an intricate seismoscope to the court which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant earthquake on one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest as there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400km 248mi to 500km 310mi northwest of luoyang in gansu province a year after zhang presented his seismoscope to the court officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from heaven the ancient chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth in zhangs memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters he criticized the new recruitment system of zuo xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title filial and incorrupt at age forty the new system also transferred the power of the candidates assessment to the three excellencies rather than the generals of the household who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen although zhangs memorial was rejected his status was significantly elevated soon after to palace attendant a position he used to influence the decisions of emperor shun with this prestigious new position zhang earned a salary of 2000bushels and had the right to escort the emperor as palace attendant to emperor shun zhang heng attempted to convince him that the court eunuchs represented a threat to the imperial court zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs and convinced shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence the eunuchs attempted to slander zhang who responded with a fu rhapsody called fu on pondering the mystery which vents his frustration rafe de crespigny states that zhangs rhapsody used imagery similar to qu yuans 340278bc poem li sao and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it literature and poetry while working for the central court zhang heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the archives of the eastern pavilion zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the records of the grand historian by sima qian 14590bc and the book of han by ban gu ad3292 differed from other ancient texts that were available to him his account was preserved and recorded in the 5thcentury text of the book of later han by fan ye 398445 his rhapsodies and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts chinese philosophy and histories he also compiled a commentary on the taixuan great mystery by the daoist author yang xiong 53bcad18 xiao tong 501531 a crown prince of the liang dynasty 502557 immortalized several of zhangs works in his literary anthology selections of refined literature wen xuan zhangs rhapsodies fu include western metropolis rhapsody x jng f eastern metropolis rhapsody dng jng f southern capital rhapsody nn d f rhapsody on contemplating the mystery s xun f and rhapsody on returning to the fields gu tin f the latter fuses daoist ideas with confucianism and was a precursor to later chinese metaphysical nature poetry according to liu wu-chi a set of four short lyric poems shi entitled lyric poems on four sorrows s chu f is also included with zhangs preface this set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic shi chinese poetry written while still in luoyang zhang became inspired to write his western metropolis rhapsody and eastern metropolis rhapsody which were based on the rhapsody on the two capitals by the historian ban gu zhangs work was similar to bans although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous eastern han regime while zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the western han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity these two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes zhangs southern capital rhapsody commemorated his home city of nanyang home of the restorer of the han dynasty guangwu in zhang hengs poem four sorrows he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains snows and rivers rafe de crespigny tong xiao and david r knechtges claim that zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men this poem is one of the first in china to have seven words per line his four sorrows reads in another poem of his called stabilizing the passions dng qng f preserved in a tang dynasty 618907 encyclopedia but referred to earlier by tao qian 365427 in praise of zhangs lyrical minimalism zhang displays his admiration for an attractive and exemplary woman this simpler type of fu poem influenced later works by the prominent official and scholar cai yong 132192 zhang wrote zhangs long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography his rhapsody sir based-on-nothing provides details on terrain palaces hunting parks markets and prominent buildings of changan the western han capital exemplifying his attention to detail his rhapsody on nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic summer bamboo shoots autumn leeks winter rape-turnips perilla evodia and purple ginger zhang hengs writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of changan as his estimate for the circumference of the parks encircling wall agrees with the historian ban gus estimate of roughly 400li one li in han times was equal to 4158m or 1364ft making the circumference of the park wall 166320m or 545600ft along with sima xiangru 179117bc zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from northern or southern china somewhat similar to the description of sima xiangru zhang described the western han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings water plays fishing and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of tall towers along changans kunming lake the focus of zhangs writing on specific places and their terrain society people and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization in his poem xijing fu zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of buddhism introduced via the silk road as well as the legend of the birth of buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception in his western metropolis rhapsody zhang described court entertainments such as juedi a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks with his responding to criticism ying jian a work modeled on yang xiongs justification against ridicule zhang was an early writer and proponent of the chinese literary genre shelun or hypothetical discourse authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person or a real person of their entourage or association the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life he also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power in this work dominik declercq asserts that the person urging zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or empress liangs 116150 powerful relatives in the liang clan declercq states that these two groups would have been anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side but zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls this was seen as a general criticism of the eastern han emperors and their imperial favorites guised in the criticism of earlier western han emperors besides criticizing the western han emperors for lavish decadence zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the chinese cyclical beliefs in yin and yang in a poem criticizing the previous western han dynasty zhang wrote achievements in science and technology astronomy and mathematics for centuries the chinese approximated pi as 3 liu xin d ad23 made the first known chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 31457 but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure in his work around 130 zhang heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232 thus calculating pi as 31724 in zhangs day the ratio 43 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 43 in formula with d as diameter and v as volume dv 169 or v 9 16 displaystyle tfrac 916 d zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional 1 16 displaystyle tfrac 116 d hence v 9 16 displaystyle tfrac 916 d 1 16 displaystyle tfrac 116 d 5 8 displaystyle tfrac 58 d with the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 85 the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is 85 from this formula zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 or approximately 3162 zhang also calculated pi as 730 232 displaystyle tfrac 730232 31466 in his book ling xian in the 3rdcentury liu hui made the calculation more accurate with his algorithm which allowed him to obtain the value 314159 later zu chongzhi 429500 approximated pi as 355 113 displaystyle tfrac 355113 or 3141592 the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient chinese would achieve in his publication of ad120 called the spiritual constitution of the universe ling xian lit sublime model zhang heng theorized that the universe was like an egg as round as a crossbow pellet with the stars on the shell and the earth as the central yolk this universe theory is congruent with the geocentric model as opposed to the heliocentric model although the ancient warring states 403221 bc chinese astronomers shi shen and gan de had compiled chinas first star catalogue in the 4thcenturybc zhang nonetheless catalogued 2500 stars which he placed in a brightly shining category the chinese estimated the total to be 14000 and he recognized 124constellations in comparison this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the greek astronomer hipparchus c 190c120bc in his catalogue and more than ptolemy ad83161 who catalogued over 1000 zhang supported the radiating influence theory to explain solar and lunar eclipses a theory which was opposed by wang chong ad2797 in the ling xian zhang wrote the sun is like fire and the moon like water the fire gives out light and the water reflects it thus the moons brightness is produced from the radiance of the sun and the moons darkness is due to the light of the sun being obstructed the side which faces the sun is fully lit and the side which is away from it is dark the planets as well as the moon have the nature of water and reflect light the light pouring forth from the sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itselfthis is called an-xu a lunar eclipse when a similar effect happens with a planet we call it an occultation when the moon passes across the suns path then there is a solar eclipse zhang heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well the signs of comets eclipses and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies the music theorist and mathematician jing fang 7837bc wrote about the spherical shape of the sun and moon while discussing eclipses the moon and the planets are yin they have shape but no light this they receive only when the sun illuminates them the former masters regarded the sun as round like a crossbow bullet and they thought the moon had the nature of a mirror some of them recognized the moon as a ball too those parts of the moon which the sun illuminates look bright those parts which it does not remain dark the theory posited by zhang and jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as shen kuo 10311095 who expanded on the reasoning of why the sun and moon were spherical the theory of the celestial sphere surrounding a flat square earth was later criticized by the jin-dynasty scholar-official yu xi fl 307-345 he suggested that the earth could be round like the heavens a spherical earth theory fully accepted by mathematician li ye 1192-1279 but not by mainstream chinese science until european influence in the 17th century extra tank for inflow clepsydra the outflow clepsydra was a timekeeping device used in china as long ago as the shang dynasty c1600c1050bc and certainly by the zhou dynasty 1122256bc the inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in china since the beginning of the han dynasty in 202bc and had replaced the outflow type the han chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled zhang heng was the first to address this problem indicated in his writings from 117 by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel zhang also mounted two statuettes of a chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right joseph needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of zhang heng in 610 the sui dynasty 581618 engineers geng xun and yuwen kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year zhang mentioned a jade dragons neck which in later times meant a siphon he wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows bronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels they are filled with pure water each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a jade dragons neck the water dripping from above enters two inflow receivers alternately the left one being for the night and the right one for the day on the covers of each inflow receiver there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze the left night one is an immortal and the right day one is a policeman these figures guide the indicator-rod lit arrow with their left hands and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands thus giving the time water-powered armillary sphere zhang heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic motive power ie by employing a waterwheel and clepsydra to rotate an armillary sphere an astronomical instrument representing the celestial sphere the greek astronomer eratosthenes 276194bc invented the first armillary sphere in 255bc the chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52bc with the astronomer geng shouchangs addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring in ad 84 the astronomers fu an and jia kui added the ecliptic ring and finally zhang heng added the horizon and meridian rings this invention is described and attributed to zhang in quotations by hsu chen and li shan referencing his book lou shui chuan hun thien i chieh apparatus for rotating an armillary sphere by clepsydra water it was likely not an actual book by zhang but a chapter from his hun i or hun i thu chu written in 117 ad his water-powered armillary influenced the design of later chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the escapement mechanism by the 8thcentury the historian joseph needham 19001995 states what were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in china the chief tradition leading to yi xing ad 725 was of course the succession of pre-clocks which had started with zhang heng about 125 reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft zhang heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in chinese culture in the previous century zhang did not initiate the chinese tradition of hydraulic engineering which began during the mid zhou dynasty c6thcenturybc through the work of engineers such as sunshu ao and ximen bao zhangs contemporary du shi dad38 was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the bellows of a blast furnace to make pig iron and the cupola furnace to make cast iron zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125 stating the equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 519 degrees away from the pole the circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 degrees with the equator thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 degrees and a fraction away from the pole while at the winter solstice it is 115 degrees and a fraction away hence the points where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes but now it has been recorded that the spring equinox is 90 and 14 degrees away from the pole and the autumn equinox is 92 and 14 degrees away the former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the results obtained by the method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the xia dynasty calendar zhang hengs water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations his model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water-powered instruments of later astronomers such as yi xing 683727 zhang sixun fl10thcentury su song 10201101 guo shoujing 12311316 and many others water-powered armillary spheres in the tradition of zhang hengs were used in the eras of the three kingdoms 220280 and jin dynasty 265420 yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418 due to invasions of northern xiongnu nomads zhang hengs old instruments were recovered in 418 when emperor wu of liu song r420422 captured the ancient capital of changan although still intact the graduation marks and the representations of the stars moon sun and planets were quite worn down by time and rust in 436 the emperor ordered qian luozhi the secretary of the bureau of astronomy and calendar to recreate zhangs device which he managed to do successfully qians water-powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the liang dynasty 502557 and successive models of water-powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties zhangs seismoscope from the earliest times the chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes it was recorded in sima qians records of the grand historian of 91bc that in 780bc an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers it was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the earths crust instead the people of the ancient zhou dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang along with the heavens displeasure with acts committed or the common peoples grievances ignored by the current ruling dynasty these theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the yijing book of changes in its fifty-first hexagram there were other early theories about earthquakes developed by those such as the ancient greeks anaxagoras c500428bc believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the earths hollows democritus c 460370bc believed that the saturation of the earth with water caused them anaximenes c585c525bc believed they were the result of massive pieces of the earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying and aristotle 384322bc believed they were caused by instability of vapor pneuma caused by the drying of the moist earth by the suns rays during the han dynasty many learned scholarsincluding zhang hengbelieved in the oracles of the winds these oracles of the occult observed the direction force and timing of the winds to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on earth these ideas influenced zhang hengs views on the cause of earthquakes against the grain of earlier theories proposed by his fellow chinese and contemporary greeks zhang heng believed that earthquakes were caused by wind and air writing the chief cause of earthquake is air an element naturally swift and shifting from place to place as long as it is not stirred but lurks in a vacant space it reposes innocently giving no trouble to objects around it but any cause coming upon it from without rouses it or compresses it and drives it into a narrow space and when opportunity of escape is cut off then with deep murmur of the mountain it roars around the barriers which after long battering it dislodges and tosses on high growing more fierce the stronger the obstacle with which it has contended in 132 zhang heng presented to the han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention the first seismoscope a seismoscope records the motions of earths shaking but unlike a seismometer it does not retain a time record of those motions it was named earthquake weathervane houfeng didongyi and it was able to roughly determine the direction out of eight directions where the earthquake came from according to the book of later han compiled by fan ye in the 5thcentury his bronze urn-shaped device with a swinging pendulum inside was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of mileskilometers away this was essential for the han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster the book of later han records that on one occasion zhangs device was triggered though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in longxi modern gansu province the same direction that zhangs device had indicated and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device to indicate the direction of a distant earthquake zhangs device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose his device had eight mobile arms for all eight directions connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery when tripped a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head his device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank a catch device a pivot on a projection a sling suspending the pendulum an attachment for the sling and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum wang zhenduo argued that the technology of the eastern han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers later chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent zhangs seismoscope they included the 6th-century mathematician and surveyor xindu fang of the northern qi dynasty 550577 and the astronomer and mathematician lin xiaogong of the sui dynasty 581618 like zhang xindu fang and lin xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court by the time of the yuan dynasty 12711368 it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved except for that of the seismoscope this was discussed by the scholar zhou mi around 1290 who remarked that the books of xindu fang and lin xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found horwitz kreitner and needham speculate if tang dynasty 618907 era seismographs found their way to contemporary japan according to needham instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder have been described hong-sen yan states that modern replicas of zhangs device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in chinese historical records wang zhenduo presented two different models of the seismoscope based on the ancient descriptions of zhangs device in his 1936 reconstruction the central pillar du zhu of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an inverted pendulum according to needham while working in the seismological observatory of tokyo university in 1939 akitsune imamura and hagiwara made a reconstruction of zhangs device while it was john milne and wang zhenduo who argued early on that zhangs central pillar was a suspended pendulum imamura was the first to propose an inverted model he argued that transverse shock would have rendered wangs immobilization mechanism ineffective as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position on june 13 2005 modern chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument anthony j barbieri-low a professor of early chinese history at the university of california santa barbara names zhang heng as one of several high-ranking eastern-han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans gong such as mechanical engineering barbieri-low speculates that zhang only designed his seismoscope but did not actually craft the device himself he asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by zhang he writes zhang heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the gong artisans and the government slaves most likely he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops cartography the wei 220265 and jin dynasty 265420 cartographer and official pei xiu 224271 was the first in china to describe in full the geometric grid reference for maps that allowed for precise measurements using a graduated scale as well as topographical elevation however map-making in china had existed since at least the 4thcenturybc with the qin state maps found in gansu in 1986 pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the qin and han dynasty respectively as evidenced by their existing maps while the use of a rectangular grid had been known in china since the han as well historian howard nelson states that although the accounts of zhang hengs work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy there is ample written evidence that pei xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of zhang heng rafe de crespigny asserts that it was zhang who established the rectangular grid system in chinese cartography needham points out that the title of his book flying bird calendar may have been a mistake and that the book is more accurately entitled birds eye map historian florian c reiter notes that zhangs narrative guitian fu contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of confucius of the zhou dynasty which reiter suggests places maps tu on a same level of importance with documents shu it is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by zhang heng in 116 ad called a ti hsing thu odometer and south-pointing chariot zhang heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer an achievement also attributed to archimedes c287212bc and heron of alexandria flad1070 similar devices were used by the roman and han-chinese empires at about the same period by the 3rdcentury the chinese had termed the device the ji li gu che or li-recording drum carriage the modern measurement of li500m1640ft ancient chinese texts describe the mechanical carriages functions after one li was traversed a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum and after ten li had been covered another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm however there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in han dynasty china that centered on the huang mencourt people ie eunuchs palace officials attendants and familiars actors acrobats etc who followed the musical procession of the royal drum-chariot there is speculation that at some time during the 1stcenturybc the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels this might have actually been the design of luoxia hong c110bc yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known as it was depicted in a mural of the xiao tang shan tomb the south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to zhang heng it was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot differential gears driven by the chariots wheels allowed a wooden figurine in the shape of a chinese state
