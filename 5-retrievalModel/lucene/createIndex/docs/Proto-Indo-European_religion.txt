proto-indo-european mythology is the body of myths and stories associated with the proto-indo-europeans although these stories are not directly attested they have been reconstructed by scholars of comparative mythology based on the similarities in the belief systems of various indo-european peoples various schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of proto-indo-european mythology which do not always agree with each other the main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are vedic roman and norse often supported with evidence from the baltic celtic greek slavic and hittite traditions as well the proto-indo-european pantheon includes well-attested deities such as dyus patr the god of the daylit skies his daughter hauss the goddess of the dawn the divine twins and the storm god perkunos other probable deities include ph2usn a pastoral god and seh2ul a female solar deity well-attested myths of the proto-indo-europeans include a myth involving a storm god who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world the proto-indo-europeans may have believed that the otherworld was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river they also may have believed in a world tree bearing fruit of immortality either guarded by or gnawed on by a serpent or dragon and tended by three goddesses who spun the thread of life methods of reconstruction schools of thought the mythology of the proto-indo-europeans is not directly attested and it is difficult to match their language to archaeological findings related to any specific culture from the chalcolithic nonetheless scholars of comparative mythology have attempted to reconstruct aspects of proto-indo-european mythology based on the existence of similarities among the deities religious practices and myths of various indo-european peoples this method is known as the comparative method different schools of thought have approached the subject of proto-indo-european mythology from different angles the meteorological school holds that proto-indo-european mythology was largely centered around deified natural phenomena such as the sky the sun the moon and the dawn this meteorological interpretation was popular among early scholars such as friedrich max mller who saw all myths as fundamentally solar allegories this school lost most of its scholarly support in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the ritual school which first became prominent in the late nineteenth century holds that proto-indo-european myths are best understood as stories invented to explain various rituals and religious practices the ritual school reached the height of its popularity during the early twentieth century many of its most prominent early proponents such as james george frazer and jane ellen harrison were classical scholars bruce lincoln a contemporary member of the ritual school argues that the proto-indo-europeans believed that every sacrifice was a reenactment of the original sacrifice performed by the founder of the human race on his twin brother the functionalist school holds that proto-indo-european society and consequently their mythology was largely centered around the trifunctional system proposed by georges dumzil which holds that proto-indo-european society was divided into three distinct social classes farmers warriors and priests the structuralist school by contrast argues that proto-indo-european mythology was largely centered around the concept of dualistic opposition this approach generally tends to focus on cultural universals within the realm of mythology rather than the genetic origins of those myths but it also offers refinements of the dumzilian trifunctional system by highlighting the oppositional elements present within each function such as the creative and destructive elements both found within the role of the warrior source mythologies one of the earliest attested and thus most important of all indo-european mythologies is vedic mythology especially the mythology of the rigveda the oldest of the vedas early scholars of comparative mythology such as friedrich max mller stressed the importance of vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with proto-indo-european myth modern researchers have been much more cautious recognizing that although vedic mythology is still central other mythologies must also be taken into account another of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is roman mythology contrary to the frequent erroneous statement made by some authors that rome has no myth the romans possessed a very complex mythological system parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts despite its relatively late attestation norse mythology is still considered one of the three most important of the indo-european mythologies for comparative research simply due to the vast bulk of surviving icelandic material baltic mythology has also received a great deal of scholarly attention but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late nonetheless latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing proto-indo-european myth despite the popularity of greek mythology in western culture greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of pre-greek and near eastern cultures which overwhelms what little indo-european material can be extracted from it consequently greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the mid 2000s although scythians are considered relatively conservative in regards to proto-indo-european cultures retaining a similar lifestyle and culture their mythology has very rarely been examined in an indo-european context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral indo-european mythology at least three deities tabiti papaios and api are generally interpreted as having indo-european origins while the remaining have seen more disparate interpretations influence from siberian turkic and even near eastern beliefs on the other hand are more widely discussed in literature pantheon linguists are able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the proto-indo-european language pie from many types of sources some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others the term for a god was deiwos reflected in hittite sius latin deus divus sanskrit dyaus deva avestan daeva later persian div welsh duw irish dia lithuanian dievas latvian dievs heavenly deities sky father the head deity of the proto-indo-european pantheon was the god dyus patr whose name literally means sky father he is believed to have been regarded as the god of the daylit skies he is by far the most well-attested of all the proto-indo-european deities the greek god zeus the roman god jupiter and the illyrian god dei-ptrous all appear as the head gods of their respective pantheons the norse god tr however seems to have been demoted to the role of a minor war-deity prior to the composition of the earliest germanic texts dyus patr is also attested in the rigveda as dyus pit a minor ancestor figure mentioned in only a few hymns the names of the latvian god dievs and the hittite god attas isanus do not preserve the exact literal translation of the name dyus patr but do preserve the general meaning of it dyus patr may have had a consort who was an earth goddess this possibility is attested in the vedic pairing of dyus pit and prithvi mater the roman pairing of jupiter and tellus mater from macrobiuss saturnalia and the norse pairing of odin and jr odin is not a reflex of dyus patr but his cult may have subsumed aspects of an earlier chief deity who was this pairing may also be further attested in an old english ploughing prayer and in the greek pairings of ouranos and gaia and zeus and demeter dawn goddess hauss has been reconstructed as the proto-indo-european goddess of the dawn twenty-one hymns in the rigveda are dedicated to the dawn goddess us and a single passage from the avesta honors the dawn goddess u the dawn goddess eos appears prominently in early greek poetry and mythology the roman dawn goddess aurora is a reflection of the greek eos but the original roman dawn goddess may have continued to be worshipped under the cultic title mater matuta the anglo-saxons worshipped the goddess ostre who was associated with a festival in spring which later gave its name to a month which gave its name to the christian holiday of easter in english the name starmnth in old high german has been taken as an indication that a similar goddess was also worshipped in southern germany the lithuanian dawn goddess aura was still acknowledged in the sixteenth century us in the sanskrit tradition and eos in the greek have very similar attributes indicating that these attributes were established by at least the greco-aryan period both goddesses are also portrayed as taking mortal lovers sun and moon seh2ul and meh1not are reconstructed as the proto-indo-european goddess of the sun and god of the moon respectively seh2ul is reconstructed based on the greek god helios the roman god sol the celtic goddess sulsuil the north germanic goddess sl the continental germanic goddess sowil the hittite goddess utu-liya the zoroastrian hvare-khshaeta and the vedic god surya meh1not- is reconstructed based on the norse god mni the slavic god myesyats and the lithuanian god meno or mnuo mnulis they are often seen as the twin children of various deities but in fact the sun and moon were deified several times and are often found in competing forms within the same language the usual scheme is that one of these celestial deities is male and the other female though the exact gender of the sun or moon tends to vary among subsequent indo-european mythologies the original indo-european solar deity appears to have been female a characteristic not only supported by the higher number of sun goddesses in subsequent derivations feminine sl saule sulis tan gran aimend ine and catha versus masculine helios surya savitr usil and sol hvare-khshaeta is of neutral gender but also by vestiges in mythologies with male solar deities usil in etruscan art is depicted occasionally as a goddess while solar characteristics in athena and helen of troy still remain in greek mythology the original indo-european lunar deity appears to have been masculine with feminine lunar deities like selene minerva and luna being a development exclusive to the eastern mediterranean even in these traditions remnants of male lunar deities like menelaus remain although the sun was personified as an independent female deity the proto-indo-europeans also visualized the sun as the eye of dyus patr as seen in various reflexes helios as the eye of zeus hvare-khshaeta as the eye of ahura mazda and the sun as gods eye in romanian folklore the names of celtic sun goddesses like sulis and grian may also allude to this association the words for eye and sun are switched in these languages hence the name of the goddesses divine twins horse twins the horse twins are a set of twin brothers found throughout nearly every indo-european pantheon who usually have a name that means horse ekwa- but the names are not always cognate and no proto-indo-european name for them can be reconstructed in most indo-european pantheons the horse twins are brothers of the sun maiden or dawn goddess and sons of the sky god they are reconstructed based on the vedic ashvins the lithuanian avieniai the latvian dieva deli the greek dioskouroi kastor and polydeukes the roman dioscuri castor and pollux and the old english hengist and horsa whose names mean stallion and horse references from the greek writer timaeus indicate that the celts may have had a set of horse twins as well the welsh brn and manawydan may also be related the horse twins may have been based on the morning and evening star the planet venus and they often have stories about them in which they accompany the sun goddess because of the close orbit of the planet venus to the sun twin founders the proto-indo-european creation myth seems to have involved two key figures manu- man indic manu germanic mannus and his twin brother yemo- twin indic yama germanic ymir reflexes of these two figures usually fulfill the respective roles of founder of the human race and first human to die storm deities perkunos has been reconstructed as the proto-indo-european god of lightning and storms his name literally means the striker he is reconstructed based on the norse goddess fjrgyn the mother of thor the lithuanian god perknas and the slavic god pern the vedic god parjnya may also be related but his possible connection to perkunos is still under dispute the name of perkunos may also be attested in greek as kerauns an epithet of the god zeus meaning thunder-shaker a possible alternative name through the root stenh is responsible for thor as well as hittite tarhunt and celtic tarantaranis the roman god mars is also a speculated descendent since he originally had thunderer characteristics water deities some authors have proposed neptonos or h2epom nepts as the proto-indo-european god of the waters the name literally means grandson or nephew of the waters philologists reconstruct his name from that of the vedic god apm npt the roman god neptnus and the old irish god nechtain although such a god has been solidly reconstructed in proto-indo-iranian religion mallory and adams nonetheless still reject him as a proto-indo-european deity on linguistic grounds a river goddess dehanu- has been proposed based on the vedic goddess dnu the irish goddess danu the welsh goddess don and the names of the rivers danube don dnieper and dniester mallory and adams however dismiss this reconstruction commenting that it does not have any evidence to support it some have also proposed the reconstruction of a sea god named trihatn based on the greek god triton and the old irish word trath meaning sea mallory and adams reject this reconstruction as having no basis asserting that the lexical correspondence is only just possible and with no evidence of a cognate sea god in irish nature deities ph2usn a pastoral deity is reconstructed based on the greek god pan and the vedic god pshn both deities are closely affiliated with goats and were worshipped as pastoral deities the minor discrepancies between the two deities can be easily explained by the possibility that many attributes originally associated with pan may have been transferred over to his father hermes the association between pan and pshn was first identified in 1924 by the german scholar hermann collitz in 1855 adalbert kuhn suggested that the proto-indo-europeans may have believed in a set of helper deities whom he reconstructed based on the germanic elves and the hindu ribhus though this proposal is often mentioned in academic writings very few scholars actually accept it there may also have been a female cognate akin to the greco-roman nymphs slavic vilas the huldra of germanic folklore and the hindu apsaras societal deities it is highly probable that the proto-indo-europeans believed in three fate goddesses who spun the destinies of mankind although such fate goddesses are not directly attested in the indo-aryan tradition the atharvaveda does contain an allusion comparing fate to a warp furthermore the three fates appear in nearly every other indo-european mythology the earliest attested set of fate goddesses are the gulses in hittite mythology who were said to preside over the individual destinies of human beings they often appear in mythical narratives alongside the goddesses papaya and istustaya who in a ritual text for the foundation of a new temple are described sitting holding mirrors and spindles spinning the kings thread of life in the greek tradition the moirai apportioners are mentioned dispensing destiny in both the iliad and the odyssey in which they are given the epithet klothes meaning spinners in hesiods theogony the moirai are said to give mortal men both good and ill and their names are listed as klotho spinner lachesis apportioner and atropos inflexible in his republic plato records that klotho sings of the past lachesis of the present and atropos of the future in roman legend the parcae were three goddesses who presided over the births of children and whose names were nona ninth decuma tenth and morta death they too were said to spin destinies although this may have been due to influence from greek literature in the old norse vlusp and gylfaginning the norns are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of urr at the foot of the world tree yggdrasil in old norse texts the norns are frequently conflated with valkyries who are sometimes also described as spinning old english texts such as rhyme poem 70 and guthlac 1350 f reference wyrd as a singular power that weaves destinies later texts mention the wyrds as a group with geoffrey chaucer referring to them as the werdys that we clepyn destin in the legend of good women a goddess spinning appears in a bracteate from southwest germany and a relief from trier shows three mother goddesses with two of them holding distaffs tenth-century german ecclesiastical writings denounce the popular belief in three sisters who determined the course of a mans life at his birth an old irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in celtic mythology as well a lithuanian folktale recorded in 1839 recounts that a mans fate is spun at his birth by seven goddesses known as the deivs valdytojos and used to hang a star in the sky when he dies his thread snaps and his star falls as a meteor in latvian folk songs a goddess called the lima is described as weaving a childs fate at its birth although she is usually only one goddess the lima sometimes appears as three the three spinning fate goddesses appear in slavic traditions in the forms of the russian roanicy the czech sudiky the bulgarian narennice or urisnice the polish rodzanice the croatian rodjenice the serbian sudjenice and the slovene rojenice albanian folk tales speak of the fatit three old women who appear three days after a child is born and determine its fate using language reminiscent of spinning although the name of a particular proto-indo-european smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed it is highly probable that the proto-indo-europeans had a smith deity of some kind since smith gods occur in nearly every indo-european culture with examples including the hittite god hasammili the vedic god tvastr the greek god hephaestus the germanic villain wayland the smith and the ossetian culture figure kurdalagon many of these smith figures share certain characteristics in common hephaestus the greek god of blacksmiths and wayland the smith a nefarious blacksmith from germanic mythology are both described as lame additionally wayland the smith and the greek mythical inventor daedalus both escape imprisonment on an island by fashioning sets of mechanical wings from feathers and wax and using them to fly away the proto-indo-europeans may have had a goddess who presided over the trifunctional organization of society various epithets of the iranian goddess anahita and the roman goddess juno provide sufficient evidence to solidly attest that she was probably worshipped but no specific name for her can be lexically reconstructed vague remnants of this goddess may also be preserved in the greek goddess athena some scholars have proposed a war god mwort- based on the roman god mars and the vedic maruts companions of the war-god indra mallory and adams however reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds likewise some researchers have found it more plausible that mars was originally a storm deity while this cannot be said for ares mythology dragon or serpent one common myth found in nearly all indo-european mythologies is a battle ending with a hero or god slaying a serpent or dragon of some sort although the details of story often vary widely in all iterations several features remain remarkably the same in iterations of the story the serpent is usually associated with water in some way the hero of the story is usually a thunder-god or a hero who is somehow associated with thunder the serpent is usually multi-headed or else multiple in some other way in hittite mythology the storm god tarhunt slays the giant serpent illuyanka in the rigveda the god indra slays the multi-headed serpent vritra which had been causing a drought in the bhagavata purana krishna slays the serpent kliy several variations of the story are also found in greek mythology as well the story is attested in the legend of zeus slaying the hundred-headed typhon from hesiods theogony but it is also in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed lernaean hydra by heracles and the slaying of python by apollo the story of heracless theft of the cattle of geryon is probably also related although heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense he bears many attributes held by other indo-european storm deities including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony the original proto-indo-european myth is also reflected in germanic mythology in norse mythology thor the god of thunder slays the giant serpent jrmungandr which lived in the waters surrounding the realm of midgard other dragon-slaying myths are also found in the germanic tradition in the vlsunga saga sigurd slays the dragon fafnir and in beowulf the eponymous hero slays a different dragon reflexes of the proto-indo-european dragon-slaying myth are found throughout other branches of the language family as well in zoroastrianism and persian mythology fereydun and later garshasp slays zahhak in slavic mythology perun the god of storms slays veles and dobrynya nikitich slays the three-headed dragon zmey in armenian mythology the god vahagn slays the dragon vishap in romanian folklore ft-frumos slays the fire-spitting monster zmeu in celtic mythology dian cecht slays meichi the myth is believed to have symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos in every version of the story the dragon or serpent always loses although in some mythologies such as the norse ragnark myth the hero or god dies as well twin founders the analysis of different indo-european tales indicates that the proto-indo-europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind manu- man and yemo- twin his twin brother a reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by david w anthony attributed in part to bruce lincoln manu and yemo traverse the cosmos accompanied by the primordial cow and finally decide to create the world to do so manu sacrifices either yemo or the cow and with help from the sky father the storm god and the divine twins forges the earth from the remains manu thus becomes the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice the sky gods then present cattle to the third man trito who loses it to the three-headed serpent nghi but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue reflexes of manu include indic manu germanic mannus of yemo indic yama avestan yima norse ymir possibly roman remus earlier old latin yemos the early history of rome is widely recognized as a historicized retelling of various old myths romulus and remus are twin brothers from roman mythology who both have stories in which they are killed the roman writer livy reports that remus was believed to have been killed by his brother romulus at the founding of rome when they entered into a disagreement about which hill to build the city on later romulus himself is said to have been torn limb-from-limb by a group of senators both of these myths are widely recognized as historicized remnants of the proto-indo-european creation story the germanic languages have information about both ymir and mannus reflexes of yemo- and manu- respectively but they never appear together in the same myth instead they only occur in myths widely separated by both time and circumstances in chapter two of his book germania which was written in latin in around 98 ad the roman writer tacitus claims that mannus the son of tuisto was the ancestor of the germanic peoples this name never recurs anywhere in later germanic literature but one proposed meaning of the continental germanic tribal name alamanni is mannus own people all-men being another scholarly etymology fire in water another important possible myth is the myth of the fire in the waters a myth which centers around the possible deity h2epom nepts a fiery deity who dwells in water in the rigveda the god apm npt is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters in celtic mythology a well belonging to the god nechtain is said to blind all those who gaze into it in an old armenian poem a small reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero vahagn springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns in a ninth-century norwegian poem by the poet thiodolf the name svar nir meaning grandson of the sea is used as a kenning for fire even the greek tradition contains possible allusions to the myth of a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea the phrase meaning descendants of the beautiful seas is used in the odyssey 4404 as an epithet for the seals of proteus binding of evil jaan puhvel notes similarities between the norse myth in which the god tr inserts his hand into the wolf fenrirs mouth while the other gods bind him with gleipnir only for fenrir to bite off trs hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings and the iranian myth in which jamshid rescues his brothers corpse from ahrimans bowels by reaching his hand up ahrimans anus and pulling out his brothers corpse only for his hand to become infected with leprosy in both accounts an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the beings orifice in fenrirs case the mouth in ahrimans the anus and losing it fenrir and ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and are unlikely to be remnants of a proto-indo-european evil god nonetheless it is clear that the binding myth is of proto-indo-european origin cosmogony in the cosmogonic myths of many indo-european cultures a cosmic egg symbolizes the primordial state from which the universe arises cosmology underworld most indo-european traditions contain some kind of underworld or afterlife it is possible that the proto-indo-europeans may have believed that in order to reach the underworld one needed to cross a river guided by an old man erhaont- the greek tradition of the dead being ferried across the river styx by charon is probably a reflex of this belief the idea of crossing a river to reach the underworld is also present throughout celtic mythologies several vedic texts contain references to crossing a river in order to reach the land of the dead and the latin word tarentum meaning tomb originally meant crossing point in norse mythology hermr must cross a bridge over the river gill in order to reach hel in latvian folk songs the dead must cross a marsh rather than a river traditions of placing coins on the bodies of the deceased in order to pay the ferryman are attested in both ancient greek and early modern slavic funerary practices it is also possible that the proto-indo-europeans may have believed that the underworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog similar to the greek cerberus the hindu rvara or the norse garmr world tree and serpent the proto-indo-europeans may have believed in some kind of world tree it is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent in norse mythology the cosmic tree yggdrasil is tended by the three norns while the dragon nidhogg gnaws at its roots in greek mythology the tree of the golden apples in the garden of the hesperides is tended by the three hesperides and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon ladon in indo-iranian texts there is a mythical tree dripping with soma the immortal drink of the gods and in later pahlavi sources a malicious lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it see also mythology portal interpretatio graeca the comparison of greek deities to germanic roman and celtic deities
