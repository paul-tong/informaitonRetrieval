the v-2 german vergeltungswaffe 2 retribution weapon 2 technical name aggregat 4 a4 was the worlds first long-range guided ballistic missile the missile powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed during the second world war in germany as a vengeance weapon assigned to attack allied cities as retaliation for the allied bombings against german cities the v-2 rocket also became the first man-made object to travel into space by crossing the krmn line with the vertical launch of mw 18014 on 20 june 1944 research into military use of long range rockets began when the studies of graduate student wernher von braun attracted the attention of the german army a series of prototypes culminated in the a-4 which went to war as the v-2 beginning in september 1944 over 3000 v-2s were launched by the german wehrmacht against allied targets first london and later antwerp and lige according to a 2011 bbc documentary the attacks from v-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9000 civilians and military personnel and a further 12000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons as germany collapsed teams from the allied forcesthe united states the united kingdom and the soviet unionraced to capture key german manufacturing sites and technology wernher von braun and over 100 key v-2 personnel surrendered to the americans eventually many of the original v-2 team ended up working at the redstone arsenal the us also captured enough v-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles the soviets gained possession of the v-2 manufacturing facilities after the war re-established v-2 production and moved it to the soviet union developmental history in the late 1920s a young wernher von braun bought a copy of hermann oberths book die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket into interplanetary spaces starting in 1930 he attended the technical university of berlin where he assisted oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests von braun was working on his doctorate when the nazi party gained power in germany an artillery captain walter dornberger arranged an ordnance department research grant for von braun who from then on worked next to dornbergers existing solid-fuel rocket test site at kummersdorf von brauns thesis construction theoretical and experimental solution to the problem of the liquid propellant rocket dated 16 april 1934 was kept classified by the german army and was not published until 1960 by the end of 1934 his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of 22 and 35km 14 and 22mi at the time germany was highly interested in american physicist robert h goddards research before 1939 german engineers and scientists occasionally contacted goddard directly with technical questions von braun used goddards plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the aggregat a series of rockets named for the german word for mechanism or mechanical system following successes at kummersdorf with the first two aggregate series rockets wernher von braun and walter riedel began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 1936 based on a projected 25000kg 55000lb thrust engine after the a-4 project was postponed due to unfavourable aerodynamic stability testing of the a-3 in july 1936 von braun specified the a-4 performance in 1937 and after an extensive series of test firings of the a-5 scale test model using a motor redesigned from the troublesome a-3 by walter thiel a-4 design and construction was ordered c 193839 during 2830 september 1939 der tag der weisheit english the day of wisdom conference met at peenemnde to initiate the funding of university research to solve rocket problems by late 1941 the army research center at peenemnde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the a-4 the four key technologies for the a-4 were large liquid-fuel rocket engines supersonic aerodynamics gyroscopic guidance and rudders in jet control at the time adolf hitler was not particularly impressed by the v-2 he pointed out that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost in early september 1943 von braun promised the long-range bombardment commission that the a-4 development was practically completeconcluded but even by the middle of 1944 a complete a-4 parts list was still unavailable hitler was sufficiently impressed by the enthusiasm of its developers and needed a wonder weapon to maintain german morale so he authorized its deployment in large numbers the v-2s were constructed at the mittelwerk site by prisoners from mittelbau-dora a concentration camp where 12000-20000 prisoners died during the war technical details the a-4 used a 74 ethanolwater mixture b-stoff for fuel and liquid oxygen lox a-stoff for oxidizer at launch the a-4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power and a program motor controlled the pitch to the specified angle at engine shutdown after which the rocket continued on a ballistic free-fall trajectory the rocket reached a height of 80km 50mi after shutting off the engine the fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine and the steam was produced by concentrated hydrogen peroxide with sodium permanganate catalyst both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy the combustion burner reached a temperature of 2500 to 2700c 4530 to 4890f the alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner this regenerative cooling heated the fuel and cooled the combustion chamber the fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1224 nozzles which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber forming a cooled boundary layer that further protected the wall of the chamber especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest the boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere accounting for the long diffuse exhaust plume by contrast later post-v-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with shock diamonds the warhead was another source of troubles the explosive employed was amatol 6040 detonated by an electric contact fuze amatol had the advantage of stability and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of fiberglass but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase the warhead weighed 975 kilograms 2150lb and contained 910 kilograms 2010lb of explosive the warheads percentage by weight that was explosive was 93 a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition the protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the a-4 did not have the tendency to form ice which was common to other early missiles like the balloon tank-design sm-65 atlas the tanks held 4173 kilograms 9200lb of ethyl alcohol and 5553 kilograms 12242lb of oxygen the v-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor the lev-3 guidance system consisted of two free gyroscopes a horizontal and a vertical for lateral stabilization and a piga accelerometer to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity the v-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location so the distance and azimuth to the target were known fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth some later v-2s used guide beams radio signals transmitted from the ground to keep the missile on course but the first models used a simple analog computer that adjusted the azimuth for the rocket and the flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut-off brennschluss ground controlled by a doppler system or by different types of on-board integrating accelerometers the rocket stopped accelerating and soon reached the top of the approximately parabolic flight curve dr friedrich kirchstein of siemens of berlin developed the v-2 radio control for motor-cut-off german brennschluss for velocity measurement professor wolman of dresden created an alternative of his doppler tracking system in 194041 which used a ground signal transponded by the a-4 to measure the velocity of the missile by 9 february 1942 peenemnde engineer de beek had documented the radio interference area of a v-2 as 10000 metres 33000 feet around the firing point and the first successful a-4 flight on 3 october 1943 used radio control for brennschluss although hitler commented on 22 september 1943 that it is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam now no opening remains for the british to interfere technically with the missile in flight about 20 of the operational v-2 launches were beam-guided the operation pinguin v-2 offensive began on 8 september 1944 when lehr- und versuchsbatterie no 444 english training and testing battery 444 launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at paris wreckage of combat v-2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff the painting of the operational v-2s was mostly a ragged-edged pattern with several variations but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket also appeared during tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic black-and-white chessboard pattern which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis the original german designation of the rocket was v2 unhyphenated exactly as used for any third reich-era second prototype example of an rlm-registered german aircraft design but us publications such as life magazine were using the hyphenated form v-2 as early as december 1944 this hyphenated form has now become common usage testing the first successful test flight was on 3 october 1942 reaching an altitude of 845 kilometres 525 miles walter dornberger in a speech at peenemnde of 3 october 1942 declared this third day of october 1942 is the first of a new era in transportation that of space travel two test launches were recovered by the allies the bckebo rocket the remnants of which landed in sweden on 13 june 1944 and one recovered by the polish resistance on 30 may 1944 from blizna and transported to the uk during operation most iii the highest altitude reached during the war was 1746 kilometres 1085 miles 20 june 1944 test launches of v-2 rockets were made at peenemnde blizna and tuchola forest and after the war at cuxhaven by the british white sands proving grounds and cape canaveral by the us and kapustin yar by the ussr various design issues were identified and solved during v-2 development and testing to reduce tank pressure and weight high flow turbopumps were used to boost pressure a short and lighter combustion chamber without burn-through was developed by using centrifugal injection nozzles a mixing compartment and a converging nozzle to the throat for homogeneous combustion film cooling was used to prevent burn-through at the nozzle throat relay contacts were made more durable to withstand vibration and prevent thrust cut-off just after lift-off ensuring that the fuel pipes had tension-free curves reduced the likelihood of explosions at 12001800m 40006000ft fins were shaped with clearance to prevent damage as the exhaust jet expanded with altitude to control trajectory at liftoff and supersonic speeds heat-resistant graphite vanes were used as rudders in the exhaust jet air burst problem through mid-march 1944 only four of the 26 successful blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the sarnaki target area due to in-flight breakup luftzerleger on re-entry into the atmosphere as mentioned above one rocket was collected by the home army parts of it transported to london for tests initially the german developers suspected excessive alcohol tank pressure but by april 1944 after five months of test firings the cause was still not determined major-general rossmann the army weapons office department chief recommended stationing observers in the target area c mayjune dornberger and von braun set up a camp at the centre of the poland target zone after moving to the heidekraut ss mortar battery 500 of the 836th artillery battalion motorized was ordered on 30 august to begin test launches of eighty sleeved rockets testing confirmed that the so-called tin trousers a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding reduced the likelihood of air bursts production on 22 december 1942 hitler signed the order for mass production when speer assumed final technical data would be ready by july 1943 however many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943 a production line was nearly ready at peenemnde when the operation hydra attack caused the germans to move production to the underground mittelwerk in the kohnstein where 5200 v-2 rockets were built with the use of forced labour launch sites following operation crossbow bombing initial plans for launching from the massive underground watten and wizernes bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the chteau du molay were dropped in favour of mobile launching eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by july 1944 the one at mery-sur-oise was begun in august 1943 and completed by february 1944 the missile could be launched practically anywhere roads running through forests being a particular favourite the system was so mobile and small that only one meillerwagen was ever caught in action by allied aircraft during the operation bodenplatte attack on 1 january 1945 near lochem by a usaaf 4th fighter group aircraft although raymond baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it it was estimated that a sustained rate of 350 v-2s could be launched per week with 100 per day at maximum effort given sufficient supply of the rockets operational history the lxv armeekorps zbv formed during the last days of november 1943 in france commanded by general der artillerie zv erich heinemann was responsible for the operational use of v-2 after hitlers 29 august 1944 declaration to begin v-2 attacks as soon as possible the offensive began on 8 september 1944 with a single launch at paris which caused modest damage near porte ditalie two more launches by the 485th followed including one from the hague against london on the same day at 643pm the first landed at staveley road chiswick killing 63-year-old mrs ada harrison 3-year-old rosemary clarke and sapper bernard browning on leave from the royal engineers and one that hit epping with no casualties upon hearing the double-crack of the supersonic rocket londons first ever duncan sandys and reginald victor jones looked up from different parts of the city and exclaimed that was a rocket and a short while after the double-crack the sky was filled with the sound of a heavy body rushing through the air the british government initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by blaming them on defective gas mains the public therefore began referring to the v-2s as flying gas pipes the germans themselves finally announced the v-2 on 8 november 1944 and only then on 10 november 1944 did winston churchill inform parliament and the world that england had been under rocket attack for the last few weeks in september 1944 control of the v-2 mission was taken over by the waffen-ss positions of the german launch units changed a number of times for example artillerie init 444 arrived in the southwest netherlands in zeeland in september 1944 from a field near the village of serooskerke five v-2s were launched on 15 and 16 september with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th that same date a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in serooskerke itself giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon these were smuggled to london by the dutch resistance after that the unit moved to the woods near rijs gaasterland in the northwest netherlands to ensure that the technology did not fall into allied hands from gaasterland v-2s were launched against ipswich and norwich from 25 september london being out of range because of their inaccuracy these v-2s did not hit their target cities shortly after that only london and antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by adolf hitler himself antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 october after which time the unit moved to the hague over the next few months about 3172 v-2 rockets were fired at the following targets an estimated 2754 civilians were killed in london by v-2 attacks with another 6523 injured which is two people killed per v-2 rocket however this understates the potential of the v-2 since many rockets were misdirected and exploded harmlessly accuracy increased over the course of the war particularly for batteries where the leitstrahl radio guide beam system was used missile strikes that found targets could cause large numbers of deaths 160 were killed and 108 seriously injured in one explosion at 1226 pm on 25 november 1944 at a woolworths department store in new cross south-east london british intelligence sent false reports via their double-cross system implying that the rockets were over-shooting their london target by 10 to 20 miles 16 to 32km this tactic worked more than half of the v-2s aimed at london landed outside the london civil defense region most landed on less-heavily populated areas in kent due to erroneous recalibration for the remainder of the war british intelligence kept up the ruse by repeatedly sending bogus reports implying that the rockets were now striking the british capital with heavy loss of life antwerp belgium was also the target for a large number of v-weapon attacks from october 1944 through march 1945 leaving 1736 dead and 4500 injured in greater antwerp thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by 590 direct hits the largest loss of life in a single attack came on 16 december 1944 when the roof of the crowded cinema rex was struck leaving 567 dead and 291 injured possible use during operation bodenplatte at least one v-2 missile on a mobile meillerwagen launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a usaaf 4th fighter group pilot defending against the massive new years day 1945 operation bodenplatte strike by the luftwaffe over the northern german attack route near the town of lochem on 1 january 1945 possibly from the potential sighting of the american fighter by the missiles launch crew the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85 elevation to 30 tactical use after the us army captured the ludendorff bridge during the battle of remagen the germans were desperate to destroy it on 17 march 1945 they fired eleven v-2 missiles at the bridge their first use against a tactical target they could not employ the more accurate leitstrahl device because it was oriented towards antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target fired from near hellendoorn the netherlands one of the missiles landed as far away as cologne 40 miles 64km to the north while one missed the bridge by only 500 to 800 yards 460 to 730m they also struck the town of remagen destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six american soldiers final use the final two rockets exploded on 27 march 1945 one of these was the last v-2 to kill a british civilian mrs ivy millichamp aged 34 killed in her home in kynaston road orpington in kent a scientific reconstruction carried out in 2010 demonstrated that the v-2 creates a crater 20 metres 66 feet wide and 8 metres 26 feet deep ejecting approximately 3000 tons of material into the air post-war history after the nazi defeat german engineers were moved to the united states the united kingdom and the ussr where they further developed the v-2 rocket for military and civilian purposes the v-2 rocket also laid the foundation for the liquid fuel missiles and space launchers used later countermeasures big ben and crossbow unlike the v-1 the v-2s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters as it dropped from an altitude of 100110km 6268mi at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level approximately 3550kmh nevertheless the threat of what was then code-named big ben was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures the situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution the formation of the crossbow committee to collect examine and develop countermeasures early on it was believed that the v-2 employed some form of radio guidance a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver this led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as september 1944 using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the uk in october a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch by december it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect and jamming efforts ended anti-aircraft gun system general frederick alfred pile commander of anti-aircraft command studied the problem and proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rockets path but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory the first estimates suggested that 320000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket about 2 of these were expected to fall back to the ground almost 90 tons of rounds which would cause far more damage than the missile at a 25 august 1944 meeting of the crossbow committee the concept was rejected pile continued studying the problem and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to earth unexploded some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in hyde park that were provided with pre-configured firing data for 25-mile 40-kilometre grids of the london area after the trajectory was determined the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds at a crossbow meeting on 15 january 1945 piles updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from roderic hill and charles drummond ellis however the committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed by march this had changed significantly with 81 of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into or the one beside it at a 26 march meeting the plan moved ahead and pile was directed to a subcommittee with rv jones and ellis to further develop the statistics three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down plans for an operational test began but as pile later put it monty beat us to it as the attacks ended with the allied liberation of their launching areas with the germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking london they turned their attention on antwerp plans were made to move the pile system to protect that city but the war ended before anything could be done direct attack another defence against the v-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructureexpensive in terms of bomber resources and casualtiesor to cause the germans to aim at the wrong place through disinformation the british were able to convince the germans to direct v-1s and v-2s aimed at london to less populated areas east of the city this was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the german espionage network in britain which was controlled by the british the double-cross system according to the bbc television presenter raymond baxter who served with the raf during the war in february 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a v2 launch site when one missile was launched in front of them one member of baxters squadron opened fire on it without effect on 3 march 1945 the allies attempted to destroy v-2s and launching equipment in the haagse bos in the hague by a large-scale bombardment but due to navigational errors the bezuidenhout quarter was destroyed killing 511 dutch civilians churchill sent a scathing minute to general ismay requesting a thorough explanation for this extraordinarily bad aiming assessment the german v-weapons v-1 and v-2 cost the equivalent of around usd 40 billion 2015 dollars which was 50 percent more than the manhattan project that produced the atomic bomb 6048 v-2s were built at a cost of approximately 100000 reichsmark gb2370000 2011 each 3225 were launched ss general hans kammler who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including auschwitz had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program more people died manufacturing the v-2 than were killed by its deployment those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to wernher von braun we knew that each v-2 cost as much to produce as a high-performance fighter airplane we knew that german forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes and that the v-2 rockets were doing us no military damage from our point of view the v-2 program was almost as good as if hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament freeman dyson the v-2 consumed a third of germanys fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies to distil the fuel alcohol for one v-2 launch required 30 tonnes of potatoes at a time when food was becoming scarce due to a lack of explosives some warheads were simply filled in with concrete using the kinetic energy alone for destruction and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of german citizens who had died in allied bombings the v-2 lacked a proximity fuze so it could not be set for air burst it buried itself in the target area before or just as the warhead detonated this reduced its effectiveness furthermore its early guidance systems were too primitive to hit specific targets and its costs were approximately equivalent to 40 of the cost of a two-engine ju-88 bomber which was more accurate though only in a relative sense which could carry more warheads and was reusable in comparison in one 24-hour period during operation hurricane the raf dropped over 10000 long tons of bombs on brunswick and duisburg roughly equivalent to the amount of explosives that could be delivered by 10000 v-2 rockets while the v-programs did in fact divert resources needed for other more effective programs this aspect should not be overstated as the limiting factor for german aviation after 1941 was always the availability of high test aviation gas not planes or pilots so criticisms that compare their cost to hypothetical increases in fighter or bomber production are misguided on the other hand the psychological effect of the v-2 was considerable as the v-2 travelling faster than the speed of sound gave no warning before impact unlike bombing planes or the v-1 flying bomb which made a characteristic buzzing sound there was no effective defence and no risk of pilot and crew casualties with the war all but lost regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons the nazis resorted to v-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily hence antwerp as v-2 target as an extension of their desire to punish their foes and most importantly to give hope to their supporters with their miracle weapon the v-2 had no effect on the outcome of the war but it led to the icbms of the cold war that were used for space exploration unfulfilled plans a submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully making it the prototype for submarine-launched ballistic missiles the project codename was prfstand xii test stand xii sometimes called the rocket u-boat if deployed it would have allowed a u-boat to launch v-2 missiles against united states cities though only with considerable effort and limited effect hitler in july 1944 and speer in january 1945 made speeches alluding to the scheme though germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats these schemes were met by the americans with operation teardrop while interned after the war by the british at csdic camp 11 dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the fhrer to stop the v-weapon propaganda because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive to this hitler had replied that dornberger might not expect more but he hitler certainly did according to decrypted messages from the japanese embassy in germany twelve dismantled v-2 rockets were shipped to japan these left bordeaux in august 1944 on the transport u-boats u-219 and u-195 which reached djakarta in december 1944 a civilian v-2 expert was a passenger on u-234 bound for japan in may 1945 when the war ended in europe the fate of these v-2 rockets is unknown post-war use at the end of the war a race began between the united states and the ussr to retrieve as many v-2 rockets and staff as possible three hundred rail-car loads of v-2s and parts were captured and shipped to the united states and 126 of the principal designers including wernher von braun and walter dornberger were in american hands von braun his brother magnus von braun and seven others decided to surrender to the united states military operation paperclip to ensure they were not captured by the advancing soviets or shot dead by the nazis to prevent their capture britain in october 1945 british operation backfire assembled a small number of v-2 missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern germany the engineers involved had already agreed to move to the us when the test firings were complete the backfire report remains the most extensive technical documentation of the rocket including all support procedures tailored vehicles and fuel composition in 1946 the british interplanetary society proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the v-2 called megaroc it could have enabled sub-orbital spaceflight similar to but at least a decade earlier than the mercury-redstone flights of 1961 united states operation paperclip recruited german engineers and special mission v-2 transported the captured v-2 parts to the united states at the close of the second world war over 300 rail cars filled with v-2 engines fuselages propellant tanks gyroscopes and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in las cruces new mexico so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the white sands proving grounds also in new mexico in addition to v-2 hardware the us government delivered german mechanization equations for the v-2 guidance navigation and control systems as well as for advanced development concept vehicles to us defence contractors for analysis in the 1950s some of these documents were useful to us contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early us programs such as the atlas and minuteman guidance systems as well as the navys subs inertial navigation system a committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled v-2 rockets this led to an eclectic array of experiments that flew on v-2s and paved the way for american manned space exploration devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine atmospheric pressures and to see what gases were present other instruments measured the level of cosmic radiation only 68 percent of the v-2 trials were considered successful a supposed v-2 launched on 29 may 1947 landed near juarez mexico and was actually a hermes b-1 vehicle the us navy attempted to launch a german v-2 rocket at seaone test launch from the aircraft carrier uss midway was performed on 6 september 1947 as part of the navys operation sandy the test launch was a partial success the v-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some 10km 6mi from the carrier the launch setup on the midways deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over the arms pulled away just after the engine ignited releasing the missile the setup may look similar to the r-7 launch procedure but in the case of the r-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket rather than just reacting to side forces the pgm-11 redstone rocket is a direct descendant of the v-2 ussr the ussr also captured a number of v-2s and staff letting them stay in germany for a time the first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945 in 1946 as part of operation osoaviakhim they were obliged to move to kapustin yar in the ussr where helmut grttrup headed up a group of just under 250 engineers the first soviet missile was the r-1 a duplicate of the v-2 most of the german team was sent home after that project but some remained to do research until as late as 1951 unknown to the germans work immediately began on larger missiles the r-2 and r-5 based on extension of the v-2 technology in the autumn of 1945 the group led by m tikhonravov k and n g chernyshov at nii-4 rocket artillery institute of the ussr academy of sciences developed on their own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project bp-190 called for vertical flight of two pilots to an altitude of 200km using captured german v-2 rockets surviving v-2 examples and components at least 20 v-2s still existed in 2014 australia one at the australian war memorial canberra including complete meillerwagen transporter the rocket has the most complete set of guidance components of all surviving a4s the meillerwagen is the most complete of the three examples known to exist another a4 was on display at the raaf museum at point cook outside melbourne both rockets now reside in canberra netherlands one example partly skeletonized is in the collection of the royal netherlands army museum in this collection are also a launching table and some loose parts as well as the remains of a v-2 that crashed in the hague immediately after launch poland several large components like hydrogen peroxide tank and reaction chamber the propellant turbopump and the hwk rocket
