animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom animalia with few exceptions animals consume organic material breathe oxygen are able to move can reproduce sexually and grow from a hollow sphere of cells the blastula during embryonic development over 15 million living animal species have been describedof which around 1 million are insectsbut it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total animals range in length from 85millionths of a metre to 336 metres 110ft and have complex interactions with each other and their environments forming intricate food webs the category includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals the study of non-human animals is known as zoology most living animal species are in the bilateria a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan the bilateria include the protostomesin which many groups of invertebrates are found such as nematodes arthropods and molluscsand the deuterostomes containing the echinoderms and chordates including the vertebrates life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the ediacaran biota of the late precambrian many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the cambrian explosion which began around 542 million years ago 6331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without carl linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his systema naturae which jean-baptiste lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809 in 1874 ernst haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular metazoa now synonymous with animalia and the protozoa single-celled organisms no longer considered animals in modern times the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques such as molecular phylogenetics which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between animal taxa humans make use of many other animal species for food including meat milk and eggs for materials such as leather and wool as pets and as working animals for power and transport dogs have been used in hunting while many terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport non-human animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion etymology the word animal comes from the latin animalis meaning having breath having soul or living being the biological definition includes all members of the kingdom animalia in colloquial usage as a consequence of anthropocentrism the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals characteristics animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and multicellular unlike bacteria which are prokaryotic and unlike protists which are eukaryotic but unicellular unlike plants and algae which produce their own nutrients animals are heterotrophic feeding on organic material and digesting it internally with very few exceptions animals breathe oxygen and respire aerobically all animals are motile able to spontaneously move their bodies during at least part of their life cycle but some animals such as sponges corals mussels and barnacles later become sessile the blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to most animals allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs structure all animals are composed of cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins during development the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised making the formation of complex structures possible this may be calcified forming structures such as shells bones and spicules in contrast the cells of other multicellular organisms primarily algae plants and fungi are held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes with few exceptionsin particular the sponges and placozoansanimal bodies are differentiated into tissues these include muscles which enable locomotion and nerve tissues which transmit signals and coordinate the body typically there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening as in flatworms or two openings as in deuterostomes reproduction and development nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction they produce haploid gametes by meiosis the smaller motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger non-motile gametes are ova these fuse to form zygotes which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere called a blastula in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location attach to the seabed and develop into a new sponge in most other groups the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement it first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm in most cases a third germ layer the mesoderm also develops between them these germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding in some species such as the splendid fairywren malurus splendens females benefit by mating with multiple males thus producing more offspring of higher genetic quality some animals are capable of asexual reproduction which often results in a genetic clone of the parent this may take place through fragmentation budding such as in hydra and other cnidarians or parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without mating such as in aphids ecology animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material including carnivores herbivores omnivores detritivores and parasites interactions between animals form complex food webs in carnivorous or omnivorous species predation is a consumer-resource interaction where a predator feeds on another organism called its prey selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey resulting in various anti-predator adaptations almost all multicellular predators are animals some consumers use multiple methods for example in parasitoid wasps the larvae feed on the hosts living tissues killing them in the process but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours such as hawksbill sea turtles that primarily eat sponges most animals rely on the energy produced by plants through photosynthesis herbivores eat plant material directly while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire energy in the form of reduced carbon by eating other animals the carbohydrates lipids proteins and other biomolecules are broken down to allow the animal to grow and to sustain biological processes such as locomotion animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor do not depend on the energy of sunlight rather archaea and bacteria in these locations produce organic matter through chemosynthesis by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as methane and form the base of the local food web animals originally evolved in the sea lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants probably between 510471 million years ago during the late cambrian or early ordovician vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late devonian about 375 million years ago animals occupy virtually all of earths habitats and microhabitats including salt water hydrothermal vents fresh water hot springs swamps forests pastures deserts air and the interiors of animals plants fungi and rocks animals are however not particularly heat tolerant very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50c 122f only very few species of animals mostly nematodes inhabit the most extreme cold deserts of continental antarctica diversity largest and smallest the blue whale balaenoptera musculus is the largest animal that has ever lived weighing up to 190 metric tonnes and measuring up to 336 metres 110ft long the largest extant terrestrial animal is the african bush elephant loxodonta africana weighing up to 1225 tonnes and measuring up to 1067 metres 350ft long the largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as argentinosaurus which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes several animals are microscopic some myxozoa obligate parasites within the cnidaria never grow larger than 20m and one of the smallest species myxobolus shekel is no more than 85m when fully grown numbers and habitats the following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the animal groups with the largest numbers of species along with their principal habitats terrestrial fresh water and marine and free-living or parasitic ways of life species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction and these can vary wildly for instance around 2500027000 species of nematodes have been described while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 1000020000 500000 10 million and 100 million using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy the total number of animal speciesincluding those not yet describedwas calculated to be about 777 million in 2011 evolutionary origin the first fossils that might represent animals appear in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the trezona formation of south australia these fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges the oldest animals are found in the ediacaran biota towards the end of the precambrian around 610 million years ago it had long been doubtful whether these included animals but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of dickinsonia establishes that these were indeed animals many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the cambrian explosion starting about 542 million years ago in beds such as the burgess shale extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs brachiopods onychophorans tardigrades arthropods echinoderms and hemichordates along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory anomalocaris the apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the cambrian explosion possibly as early as 1 billion years ago trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the tonian period may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals roughly as large about 5mm wide and complex as earthworms however similar tracks are produced today by the giant single-celled protist gromia sphaerica so the tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution around the same time another line of evidence may indicate the appearance of grazing animals the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity perhaps due to grazing phylogeny animals are monophyletic meaning they are derived from a common ancestor animals are sister to the choanoflagellata with which they form the choanozoa the most basal animals the porifera ctenophora cnidaria and placozoa have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry their relationships are still disputed the sister group to all other animals could be the porifera or the ctenophora which like the porifera lack hox genes important in body plan development these genes are found in the placozoa and the higher animals the bilateria 6331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in the precambrian 25 of these are novel core gene groups found only in animals of those 8 are for essential components of the wnt and tgf-beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for the bodys system of axes in three dimensions and another 7 are for transcription factors including homeodomain proteins involved in the control of development the phylogenetic tree of major lineages only indicates approximately how many millions of years ago mya the lineages split non-bilaterian animals several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry among these the sponges porifera probably diverged first representing the oldest animal phylum sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla their cells are differentiated but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues they typically feed by drawing in water through pores the ctenophora comb jellies and cnidaria which includes jellyfish sea anemones and corals are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening which serves as both mouth and anus animals in both phyla have distinct tissues but these are not organised into organs they are diploblastic having only two main germ layers ectoderm and endoderm the tiny placozoans are similar but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber bilaterian animals the remaining animals the great majoritycomprising some 29 phyla and over a million speciesform a clade the bilateria the body is triploblastic with three well-developed germ layers and their tissues form distinct organs the digestive chamber has two openings a mouth and an anus and there is an internal body cavity a coelom or pseudocoelom animals with this bilaterally symmetric body plan and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end anterior and a tail end posterior as well as a back dorsal and a belly ventral therefore they also have a left side and a right side having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli such as food favouring cephalisation the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body making it longer and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles that shorten the body these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis they also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells however there are exceptions to each of these characteristics for example adult echinoderms are radially symmetric unlike their larvae while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists understanding of the relationships within the bilateria most appear to belong to two major lineages the protostomes and the deuterostomes the basalmost bilaterians are the xenacoelomorpha protostomes and deuterostomes protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways early in development deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division while many protostomes the spiralia undergo spiral cleavage animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth and the anus forms secondarily in deuterostomes the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily most protostomes have schizocoelous development where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm in deuterostomes the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching through invagination of the endoderm the main deuterostome phyla are the echinodermata and the chordata echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish sea urchins and sea cucumbers the chordates are dominated by the vertebrates animals with backbones which consist of fishes amphibians reptiles birds and mammals the deuterostomes also include the hemichordata acorn worms ecdysozoa the ecdysozoa are protostomes named after their shared trait of ecdysis growth by moulting they include the largest animal phylum the arthropoda which contains insects spiders crabs and their kin all of these have a body divided into repeating segments typically with paired appendages two smaller phyla the onychophora and tardigrada are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits the ecdysozoans also include the nematoda or roundworms perhaps the second largest animal phylum roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water some are important parasites smaller phyla related to them are the nematomorpha or horsehair worms and the kinorhyncha priapulida and loricifera these groups have a reduced coelom called a pseudocoelom spiralia the spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo the spiralias phylogeny has been disputed but it contains a large clade the superphylum lophotrochozoa and smaller groups of phyla such as the rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms all of these are grouped as the platytrochozoa which has a sister group the gnathifera which includes the rotifers the lophotrochozoa includes the molluscs annelids brachiopods nemerteans bryozoa and entoprocts the molluscs the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species includes snails clams and squids while the annelids are the segmented worms such as earthworms lugworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share trochophore larvae history of classification in the classical era aristotle divided animals based on his own observations into those with blood roughly the vertebrates and those without the animals were then arranged on a scale from man with blood 2 legs rational soul down through the live-bearing tetrapods with blood 4 legs sensitive soul and other groups such as crustaceans no blood many legs sensitive soul down to spontaneously-generating creatures like sponges no blood no legs vegetable soul aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals which in his system ought to have sensation appetite and locomotion or plants which did not he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about in 1758 carl linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his systema naturae in his original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata while his insecta which included the crustaceans and arachnids and vermes have been renamed or broken up the process was begun in 1793 by jean-baptiste de lamarck who called the vermes une espce de chaos a sort of chaos and split the group into three new phyla worms echinoderms and polyps which contained corals and jellyfish by 1809 in his philosophie zoologique lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates where he still had 4 phyla mammals birds reptiles and fish and molluscs namely cirripedes annelids crustaceans arachnids insects worms radiates polyps and infusorians in his 1817 le rgne animal georges cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements branches with different body plans roughly corresponding to phyla namely vertebrates molluscs articulated animals arthropods and annelids and zoophytes radiata echinoderms cnidaria and other forms this division into four was followed by the embryologist karl ernst von baer in 1828 the zoologist louis agassiz in 1857 and the comparative anatomist richard owen in 1860 in 1874 ernst haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms metazoa multicellular animals with five phyla coelenterates echinoderms articulates molluscs and vertebrates and protozoa single-celled animals including a sixth animal phylum sponges the protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom protista leaving only the metazoa as a synonym of animalia in human culture the human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and mainly at sea by hunting wild species marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food a smaller number of species are farmed commercially invertebrates including cephalopods crustaceans and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food chickens cattle sheep pigs and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats dyestuffs including carmine cochineal shellac and kermes have been made from the bodies of insects working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture animals such as the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century some medicines such as the cancer drug yondelis are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin people have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts a wide variety of animals are kept as pets from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses insects including praying mantises reptiles such as snakes and chameleons and birds including canaries parakeets and parrots all finding a place however the most kept pet species are mammals namely dogs cats and rabbits there is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans and their existence as individuals with rights of their own a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport animals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times both historical as in ancient egypt and prehistoric as in the cave paintings at lascaux major animal paintings include albrecht drers 1515 the rhinoceros and george stubbss c 1762 horse portrait whistlejacket insects birds and mammals play roles in literature and film such as in giant bug movies animals including insects and mammals feature in mythology and religion in both japan and europe a butterfly was seen as the personification of a persons soul while the scarab beetle was sacred in ancient egypt among the mammals cattle deer horses lions bats bears and wolves are the subjects of myths and worship the signs of the western and chinese zodiacs are
