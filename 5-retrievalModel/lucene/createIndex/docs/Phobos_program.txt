the phobos russian fobos greek program was an unmanned space mission consisting of two probes launched by the soviet union to study mars and its moons phobos and deimos phobos 1 was launched on 7 july 1988 and phobos 2 on 12 july 1988 each aboard a proton-k rocket phobos 1 suffered a terminal failure en route to mars phobos 2 attained mars orbit but contact was lost before the final phase prior to deployment of a planned phobos lander phobos 1 and 2 were of a new spacecraft design succeeding the type used in the venera planetary missions of 19751985 last used during the vega 1 and vega 2 missions to comet halley they each had a mass of 2600 kg 6220kg with orbital insertion hardware attached the program featured cooperation from 14 other nations including sweden switzerland austria france west germany and the united states which contributed the use of its nasa deep space network for tracking the twin spacecraft objectives the objectives of the phobos missions were to conduct studies of the interplanetary environment perform observations of the sun characterize the plasma environment in the martian vicinity conduct surface and atmospheric studies of mars and study the surface composition of the martian satellite phobos spacecraft design the main section of the spacecraft consisted of a pressurized toroidal electronics section surrounding a modular cylindrical experiment section below these were mounted four spherical tanks the fregat stage containing hydrazine for attitude control and after the main propulsion module was to be jettisoned orbit adjustment a total of 28 thrusters twenty-four 50 n thrusters and four 10 n thrusters were mounted on the spherical tanks with additional thrusters mounted on the spacecraft body and solar panels attitude was maintained through the use of a three-axis control system with pointing maintained with sun and star sensors phobos 1 phobos 1 operated nominally until an expected communications session on september 2 1988 failed to occur the failure of controllers to regain contact with the spacecraft was traced to an error in the software uploaded on august 29august 30 which had deactivated the attitude thrusters by losing its lock on the sun the spacecraft could no longer properly orient its solar arrays thus depleting its batteries software instructions to turn off the probes attitude control normally a fatal operation were part of a routine used when testing the spacecraft on the ground normally this routine would be removed before launch however the software was coded in proms and so removing the test code would have required removing and replacing the entire computer because of time pressure from the impending launch engineers decided to leave the command sequence in though it should never be used however a single-character error in constructing an upload sequence resulted in the command executing with subsequent loss of the spacecraft phobos 2 phobos 2 was launched atop a proton-k with a blok d upper stage from baikonur cosmodrome on july 12 1988 and entered orbit on january 29 1989 phobos 2 operated nominally throughout its cruise and mars orbital insertion phases on january 29 1989 gathering data on the sun the interplanetary medium mars and phobos phobos 2 investigated marss surface and atmosphere and returned 37 images of phobos with a resolution of up to 40 meters systems and sensors phobos probes carried several instruments solar x-ray and ultraviolet telescopes a neutron spectrometer and the grunt radar experiment designed to study the surface relief of phobos the lander had an x-rayalpha spectrometer to provide information on the chemical element composition of the surface of phobos a seismometer to determine the internal structure of phobos and the razrez penetrator with temperature sensors and an accelerometer for testing the physical and mechanical properties of the surface the phobos 2 infrared spectrometer ism obtained 45000 spectra in the near infrared from 075 to 32m in the equatorial areas of mars with a spatial resolution ranging from 7 to 25km and 400 spectra of phobos at 700 m resolution these observations made it possible to retrieve the first mineralogical maps of the planet and its satellite and to study the atmosphere of mars ism was developed at ias and despa paris observatory with support from cnes list of
