thule juli thew-lee greek thol latin thl is the farthest north location mentioned in ancient greek and roman literature and cartography modern interpretations have included orkney shetland the island of saaremaa sel in estonia and the norwegian island of smla in classical and medieval literature ultima thule latin farthermost thule acquired a metaphorical meaning of any distant place located beyond the borders of the known world by the late middle ages and early modern period the greco-roman thule was often identified with the real iceland or greenland sometimes ultima thule was a latin name for greenland when thule was used for iceland by the late 19th century however thule was frequently identified with norway in 1910 the explorer knud rasmussen established a missionary and trading post in north-western greenland which he named thule later qaanaaq thule has given its name to the northernmost united states air force airfield thule air base in northwest greenland and to the smaller lobe of kuiper belt object 486958 2014 mu69 visited by the new horizons spacecraft classical antiquity and the middle ages the greek explorer pytheas of massalia now marseille france is the first to have written of thule after his travels between 330 and 320 bc pytheas mentioned going to thule in his now lost work things about the ocean ta peri tou okeanou he supposedly was sent out by the greek city of massalia to see where their trade goods were coming from descriptions of some of his discoveries have survived in the works of later often skeptical authors polybius in his histories c 140 bc book xxxiv cites pytheas as one who has led many people into error by saying that he traversed the whole of britain on foot giving the island a circumference of forty thousand stadia and telling us also about thule those regions in which there was no longer any proper land nor sea nor air but a sort of mixture of all three of the consistency of a jellyfish in which one can neither walk nor sail holding everything together so to speak the first century bc greek astronomer geminus of rhodes claimed that the name thule went back to an archaic word for the polar night phenomenon the place where the sun goes to rest dionysius periegetes in his de situ habitabilis orbis also touched upon this subject as did martianus capella avienus in his ora maritima added that during the summer on thule night lasted only two hours a clear reference to the midnight sun strabo in his geographica c ad 30 mentions thule in describing eratosthenes calculation of the breadth of the inhabited world and notes that pytheas says it is a six days sail north of britain and is near the frozen sea but he then doubts this claim writing that pytheas has been found upon scrutiny to be an arch falsifier but the men who have seen britain and ireland do not mention thule though they speak of other islands small ones about britain strabo adds the following in book 5 now pytheas of massilia tells us that thule the most northerly of the britannic islands is farthest north and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the arctic circle but from the other writers i learn nothing on the subject neither that there exists a certain island by the name of thule nor whether the northern regions are inhabitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomes the arctic circle strabo ultimately concludes concerning thule our historical information is still more uncertain on account of its outside position for thule of all the countries that are named is set farthest north the inhabitants or people of thule are described in most detail by strabo citing pytheas the people of thule live on millet and other herbs and on fruits and roots and where there are grain and honey the people get their beverage also from them as for the grain he says since they have no pure sunshine they pound it out in large storehouses after first gathering in the ears thither for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains the mid-first century roman geographer pomponius mela placed thule north of scythia in ad 77 pliny the elder published his natural history in which he also cites pytheas claim in book ii chapter 75 that thule is a six-day sail north of britain then when discussing the islands around britain he writes the farthest of all which are known and spoke of is thule in which there be no nights at all as we have declared about mid-summer namely when the sun passes through the sign cancer and contrariwise no days in mid-winter and each of these times they suppose do last six months all day or all night finally in refining the islands location he places it along the most northerly parallel of those he describes last of all is the scythian parallel from the rhiphean hills into thule wherein as we said it is day and night continually by turns for six months the roman historian tacitus in his book chronicling the life of his father-in-law agricola describes how the romans knew that britain in which agricola was roman commander was an island rather than a continent by circumnavigating it tacitus writes of a roman ship visiting the orkneys and claims the ships crew even sighted thule however their orders were not to explore there as winter was at hand some scholars believe that tacitus was referring to shetland the third-century latin grammarian gaius julius solinus wrote in his polyhistor that thyle which was distant from orkney by a voyage of five days and nights was fruitful and abundant in the lasting yield of its crops the 4th century virgilian commentator servius also believed that thule sat close to orkney thule an island in the ocean between the northern and western zone beyond britain near orkney and ireland in this thule when the sun is in cancer it is said that there are perpetual days without nights other late classical writers and post-classical writers such as orosius 384420 and the irish monk dicuil late eighth and early ninth century describe thule as being north and west of both ireland and britain strongly suggesting that it was iceland in particular dicuil described thule as being beyond islands that seem to be the faroe islands which are between shetland and iceland solinus d ad 400 in his polyhistor repeated these descriptions noting that the people of thule had a fertile land where they grew a good production of crop and fruits in the writings of the historian procopius from the first half of the sixth century thule is a large island in the north inhabited by 25 tribes it is believed that procopius is really talking about a part of scandinavia since several tribes are easily identified including the geats gautoi in present-day sweden and the sami people scrithiphini he also writes that when the herules returned they passed the warini and the danes and then crossed the sea to thule where they settled beside the geats modern research the british surveyor charles vallancey 17311812 was one of many antiquarians to argue that ireland was thule as he does in his book an essay on the antiquity of the irish language another hypothesis first proposed by lennart meri in 1976 holds that the island of saaremaa which is often known by the exonym osel in estonia could be thule that is there is a phonological similarity between thule and the root tule- of fire in estonian and other finnic languages a crater lake named kaali on the island appears to be have been formed by a meteor strike in prehistory this meteor strike is often linked to estonian folklore which has it that saaremaa was a place where the sun at one point went to rest in 2010 scientists from the institute of geodesy and geoinformation science at the technical university of berlin claimed to have identified persistent errors in calculation that had occurred in attempts by modern geographers to superimpose geographic coordinate systems upon ptolemaic maps after correcting for these errors the scientists claimed ptolemys thule could be mapped to the norwegian island of smla modern geography and science in 1775 during his second voyage captain cook named an island in the high southern latitudes of the south atlantic ocean southern thule the name is now used for a group of three southernmost islands in the south sandwich islands one of which is called thule island the island group became a british overseas territory of the united kingdom albeit also claimed by argentina in spanish islas tule del sur in 1910 the explorer knud rasmussen established a missionary and trading post which he named thule inuit avanaa on greenland the thule people the predecessor of modern inuit greenlanders were named after the thule region in 1953 avanaa became thule air base operated by united states air force the population was forced to resettle to new thule qaanaaq 110 kilometres 67mi to the north 76315021n 68423613w 765306139n

thyle ultima is an island of the ocean in the northwestern region beyond britannia taking its name from the sun because there the sun makes its summer solstice and there is no daylight beyond ultra this hence its sea is sluggish and frozen isidore distinguished this from the islands of britannia thanet tanatos the orkneys orcades and ireland scotia or hibernia isidore was to have a large influence upon bede who was later to mention thule by the late middle ages scholars were linking iceland andor greenland to the name thule andor places reported by the irish mariner saint brendan in the 6th century and other distant or mythical locations such as hy brasil and cockaigne these scholars included works by dicuil see above the anglo-saxon monk the venerable bede in de ratione temporum the landnmabk by the anonymous historia norwegie and by the german cleric adam of bremen in his deeds of bishops of the hamburg church where they cite both ancient writers use of thule as well as new knowledge since the end of antiquity all these authors also understood that other islands were situated to the north of britain eustathius of thessalonica in his twelfth-century commentary on the iliad wrote that the inhabitants of thule were at war with a tribe whose members dwarf-like only 20 fingers in height the american classical scholar charles anthon believed this legend may have been rooted in history although exaggerated if the dwarf or pygmy tribe were interpreted as being a smaller aboriginal tribe of britain the people on thule had encountered petrarch in the fourteenth

begins with the following stanza by a route obscure and lonely haunted by ill angels only where an eidolon named night on a black throne reigns upright i have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim thule from a wild weird clime that lieth sublime out of space out of time john henry wilbrandt stuckenberg wrote on the subject in 1885 what is the minds ultima thule what substance must be regarded as first and therefore as the seed of the universe what is the eternal something of which the temporal is but a manifestation matter spirit matter and spirit something behind both and from which they have sprung neither matter nor spirit but their creator or is there in reality neither matter nor spirit but only an agnostic cause of the phenomena erroneously assigned by us to body and mind after spending many years in profoundly investigating this problem i have at last struck bottom unhesitatingly and unconditionally i adopt materialism and declare it to be the sole and all-sufficient explanation of the universe this affords the only thoroughly scientific system and nowhere but in its legitimate conclusions can thought find suitable resting-place the heart complete satisfaction and life a perfect basis unless it accepts this system philosophy will be but drift-wood instead of the stream of thought whose current bears all truth materialism thorough consistent and
