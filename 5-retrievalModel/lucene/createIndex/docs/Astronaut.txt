an astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists until 2002 astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut definition the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary the fdration aronautique internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of 100 kilometers 62mi in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 miles 80km are awarded astronaut wings as of 17november2016 a total of 552 people from 36 countries have reached 100km 62mi or more in altitude of which 549 reached low earth orbit or beyond of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit either to lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case a loop around the moon three of the 24jim lovell john young and eugene cernandid so twice the three current astronauts who have flown without reaching low earth orbit are spaceplane pilots joe walker mike melvill and brian binnie who participated in suborbital missions as of 17november2016 under the us definition 558 people qualify as having reached space above 50 miles 80km altitude of eight x-15 pilots who exceeded 50 miles 80km in altitude only one exceeded 100 kilometers about 62 miles space travelers have spent over 41790 man-days 1145 man-years in space including over 100 astronaut-days of spacewalks as of 2016 the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent 879 days in space peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days terminology in 1959 when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos near space while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut english in english-speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words stron meaning star and nautes meaning sailor the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his 1930 short story the deaths head meteor the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de linfini 1925 by j-h rosny an the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists an early use of astronaut in a non-fiction publication is eric frank russells poem the astronaut appearing in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps russian by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt russian russian pronunciationksmnaft one who works in space outside the earths atmosphere a space traveler which derives from the greek words kosmos meaning universe and nautes meaning sailor other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta coinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov 19001974 the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut chinese y hng yun space-universe navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general while hngtin yun navigating outer space personnel is used for chinese astronauts here hngtin is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within the local star system ie solar system the phrase ti kng rn spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan the term taikonaut is used by some english-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong space and the greek naut sailor the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies while no nation other than the russian federation and previously the former soviet union the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut french spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation hope to launch a spacecraft in 2022 that would carry vyomanauts coined from the sanskrit word for space in finland the nasa astronaut timothy kopra a finnish american has sometimes been referred to as sisunautti from the finnish word sisu space travel milestones the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin who was launched on april 12 1961 aboard vostok 1 and orbited around the earth for 108 minutes the first woman in space was soviet valentina tereshkova who launched on june 16 1963 aboard vostok 6 and orbited earth for almost three days alan shepard became the first american and second person in space on may 5 1961 on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight the first american to orbit the earth was john glenn aboard friendship 7 on february 20 1962 the first american woman in space was sally ride during space shuttle challengers mission sts-7 on june 18 1983 in 1992 mae jemison became the first african american woman to travel in space aboard sts-47 cosmonaut alexei leonov was the first person to conduct an extravehicular activity eva commonly called a spacewalk on march 18 1965 on the soviet unions voskhod 2 mission this was followed two and a half months later by astronaut ed white who made the first american eva on nasas gemini 4 mission the first manned mission to orbit the moon apollo 8 included american william anders who was born in hong kong making him the first asian-born astronaut in 1968 the soviet union through its intercosmos program allowed people from other socialist ie warsaw pact and other soviet-allied countries to fly on its missions with the notable exception of france participating in soyuz tm-7 an example is czechoslovak vladimr remek the first cosmonaut from a country other than the soviet union or the united states who flew to space in 1978 on a soyuz-u rocket rakesh sharma became the first indian citizen to travel to space he was launched aboard soyuz t-11 on 2 april 1984 on july 23 1980 pham tuan of vietnam became the first asian in space when he flew aboard soyuz 37 also in 1980 cuban arnaldo tamayo mndez became the first person of hispanic and black african descent to fly in space and in 1983 guion bluford became the first african american to fly into space in april 1985 taylor wang became the first ethnic chinese person in space the first person born in africa to fly in space was patrick baudry france in 1985 in 1985 saudi arabian prince sultan bin salman bin abdulaziz al-saud became the first arab muslim astronaut in space in 1988 abdul ahad mohmand became the first afghan to reach space spending nine days aboard the mir space station with the increase of seats on the space shuttle the us began taking international astronauts in 1983 ulf merbold of west germany became the first non-us citizen to fly in a us spacecraft in 1984 marc garneau became the first of 8 canadian astronauts to fly in space through 2010 in 1985 rodolfo neri vela became the first mexican-born person in space in 1991 helen sharman became the first briton to fly in space in 2002 mark shuttleworth became the first citizen of an african country to fly in space as a paying spaceflight participant in 2003 ilan ramon became the first israeli to fly in space although he died during a re-entry accident on october 15 2003 yang liwei became chinas first astronaut on the shenzhou 5 spacecraft age milestones the youngest person to fly in space is gherman titov who was 25 years old when he flew vostok 2 titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness the oldest person who has flown in space is john glenn who was 77 when he flew on sts-95 duration and distance milestones 438 days is the longest time spent in space by russian valeri polyakov as of 2006 the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven a record held by both jerry l ross and franklin chang-diaz the farthest distance from earth an astronaut has traveled was 401056km 249205mi when jim lovell jack swigert and fred haise went around the moon during the apollo 13 emergency civilian and non-government milestones the first civilian in space was valentina tereshkova aboard vostok 6 she also became the first woman in space on that mission tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussrs air force which did not accept female pilots at that time a month later joseph albert walker became the first american civilian in space when his x-15 flight 90 crossed the 100 kilometers 54 nautical miles line qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight the first people in space who had never been a member of any countrys armed forces were both konstantin feoktistov and boris yegorov aboard voskhod 1 the first non-governmental space traveler was byron k lichtenberg a researcher from the massachusetts institute of technology who flew on sts-9 in 1983 in december 1990 toyohiro akiyama became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for tokyo broadcasting system a visit to mir as part of an estimated 12 million usd deal with a japanese tv station although at the time the term used to refer to akiyama was research cosmonaut akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission which affected his productivity the first self-funded space tourist was dennis tito on board the russian spacecraft soyuz tm-3 on april 28 2001 self-funded travelers the first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was mike melvill piloting spaceshipone flight 15p on a suborbital journey although he was a test pilot employed by scaled composites and not an actual paying space tourist seven others have paid the russian space agency to fly into space dennis tito

first nasa astronauts were selected for training in 1959 early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasas neutral buoyancy laboratory astronauts-in-training astronaut candidates may also experience short periods of weightlessness microgravity in an aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified kc-135s retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c-9 which perform parabolic flights astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in t-38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from edwards air force base astronauts is training must learn how to control and fly the space shuttle and it is vital that they are familiar with the international space station so they know what they must do when they get there nasa candidacy requirements be citizens of the united states pass a strict physical examination and have a near and distant visual acuity correctable to 2020 66 blood

have a bachelors degree with teaching experience including work at the kindergarten through twelfth grade level an advanced degree such as a masters degree or a doctoral degree is not required but is strongly desired mission specialist educators or educator astronauts were first selected in 2004 and as of 2007 there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph m acaba richard r arnold and dorothy metcalf-lindenburger barbara morgan selected as back-up teacher to christa mcauliffe in 1985 is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media but she trained as a mission specialist the educator astronaut program is a successor to the teacher in space program from the 1980s health risks of space travel astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this studys techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space more recently in 2017 bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space on december 31 2012 a nasa-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimers disease in october 2015 the nasa office of inspector general issued a health hazards report related to space exploration including a human mission to mars over the last decade flight surgeons and scientists at nasa have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions the syndrome known as visual impairment intracranial pressure viip has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the international space station iss on november 2 2017 scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken trips in space based on mri studies astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts in october 2018 nasa-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space including travel to the planet mars may substantially damage the gastrointestinal tissues of astronauts the studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts and age them prematurely researchers in 2018 reported after detecting the presence on the international space station iss of five enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains none pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts food and drink an astronaut on the international space station requires about 083 kilograms 183 pounds weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day the packaging for each meal weighs around 012 kilograms - 027 pounds longer-duration missions require more food shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes five months before flight menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure bee formula on earth the average american uses about 35 gallons 132 liters of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons 11 liters per day insignia in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot-cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation this follows the practice established in the ussr where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title hero of the soviet union at nasa those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin once they have flown in space they receive a gold pin us astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge known as the astronaut badge after participation on a spaceflight the united states air force also presents an astronaut badge to its pilots who exceed 50 miles 80km in altitude deaths eighteen astronauts fourteen men and four women have lost their lives during four space flights by nationality thirteen were american including one born in india four were russian soviet union and one was israeli eleven people all men have lost their lives training for spaceflight eight americans and three russians six of these were in crashes of
