in physics optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material and spectral optical depth or spectral optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material optical depth is dimensionless and in particular is not a length though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero the use of the term optical density for optical depth is discouraged in chemistry a closely related quantity called absorbance or decadic absorbance is used instead of optical depth the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material that is the optical depth divided by ln 10 mathematical definitions optical depth optical depth of a material denoted textstyle tau is given by where e is the radiant flux received by that material e is the radiant flux transmitted by that material t is the transmittance of that material absorbance is related to optical depth by where a is the absorbance spectral optical depth spectral optical depth in frequency and spectral optical depth in wavelength of a material denoted and respectively are given by where e is the spectral radiant flux in frequency transmitted by that material e is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that material t is the spectral transmittance in frequency of that material e is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength transmitted by that material e is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that material t is the spectral transmittance in wavelength of that material spectral absorbance is related to spectral optical depth by where a is the spectral absorbance in frequency a is the spectral absorbance in wavelength relationship with attenuation attenuation optical depth measures the attenuation of the transmitted radiant power in a material attenuation can be caused by absorption but also reflection scattering and other physical processes optical depth of a material is approximately equal to its attenuation when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the emittance of that material not to be confused with radiant exitance or emissivity is much less than the optical depth where e is the radiant power transmitted by that material e is the radiant power attenuated by that material e is the radiant power received by that material e is the radiant power emitted by that material t ee is the transmittance of that material att ee is the attenuance of that material e ee is the emittance of that material and according to beerlambert law so attenuation coefficient optical depth of a material is also related to its attenuation coefficient by where l is the thickness of that material through which the light travels z is the attenuation coefficient or napierian attenuation coefficient of that material at z and if z is uniform along the path the attenuation is said to be a linear attenuation and the relation becomes sometimes the relation is given using the attenuation cross section of the material that is its attenuation coefficient divided by its number density where is the attenuation cross section of that material nz is the number density of that material at z and if n displaystyle n is uniform along the path ie n z n displaystyle nzequiv n the relation becomes applications atomic physics in atomic physics the spectral optical depth of a cloud of atoms can be calculated from the quantum-mechanical properties of the atoms it is given by where d is the transition dipole moment n is the number of atoms is the frequency of the beam c is the speed of light is plancks constant 0 is the vacuum permittivity the cross section of the beam the natural linewidth of the transition atmospheric sciences in atmospheric sciences one often refers to the optical depth of the atmosphere as corresponding to the vertical path from earths surface to outer space at other times the optical path is from the observers altitude to outer space the optical depth for a slant path is m where refers to a vertical path m is called the relative airmass and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as m sec where is the zenith angle corresponding to the given path therefore the optical depth of the atmosphere can be divided into several components ascribed to rayleigh scattering aerosols and gaseous absorption the optical depth of the atmosphere can be measured with a sun photometer the optical depth with respect

astronomy the photosphere of a star is defined as the surface where its optical depth is 23 this means that each photon emitted at the photosphere suffers an average of less than one scattering before it reaches the observer at the temperature at optical depth 23 the energy emitted by the star the original derivation is for the sun matches the observed total energy emitted note that the optical depth of a given medium will be different for different colors wavelengths of light for planetary rings the optical depth is the negative logarithm of the proportion of light blocked by the ring when it lies between the source and the observer this is usually obtained by observation of stellar occultations see also absorbance absorptance transmittance beerlambert law attenuation coefficient
