william gilbert lbrt 24 may 1544 30 november 1603 also known as gilberd was an english physician physicist and natural philosopher he passionately rejected both the prevailing aristotelian philosophy and the scholastic method of university teaching he is remembered today largely for his book de magnete 1600 and is credited as one of the originators of the term electricity he is regarded by some as the father of electrical engineering or electricity and magnetism a unit of magnetomotive force also known as magnetic potential was named the gilbert in his honour life and work gilbert was born in colchester to jerome gilberd a borough recorder he was educated at st johns college cambridge after gaining his md from cambridge in 1569 and a short spell as bursar of st johns college he left to practice medicine in london and travelled on the continent in 1573 he was elected a fellow of the royal college of physicians in 1600 he was elected president of the college he was elizabeth is own physician from 1601 until her death in 1603 and james vi and i renewed his appointment his primary scientific workmuch inspired by earlier works of robert normanwas de magnete magneticisque corporibus et de magno magnete tellure on the magnet and magnetic bodies and on the great magnet the earth published in 1600 in this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the terrella from these experiments he concluded that the earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north previously some believed that it was the pole star polaris or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass he was the first to argue correctly that the centre of the earth was iron and he considered an important and related property of magnets was that they can be cut each forming a new magnet with north and south poles in book 6 chapter 3 he argues in support of diurnal rotation though he does not talk about heliocentrism stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense celestial spheres doubting even that they exist rotate daily as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much smaller earth he also posits that the fixed stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere he states that situated in thinnest aether or in the most subtle fifth essence or in vacuity how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught the english word electricity was first used in 1646 by sir thomas browne derived from gilberts 1600 new latin electricus meaning like amber the term had been in use since the 13th century but gilbert was the first to use it to mean like amber in its attractive properties he recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called effluvium which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object though he did not realize that this substance electric charge was universal to all materials the electric effluvia differ much from air and as air is the earths effluvium so electric bodies have their own distinctive effluvia and each peculiar effluvium has its own individual power of leading to union its own movement to its origin to its fount and to the body emitting the effluvium in his book he also studied static electricity using amber amber is called elektron in greek so gilbert decided to call its effect the electric force he invented the first electrical measuring instrument the electroscope in the form of a pivoted needle he called the versorium like others of his day he believed that crystal quartz was an especially hard form of water formed from compressed ice lucid gems are made of water just as crystal which has been concreted from clear water not always by a very great cold as some used to judge and by very hard frost but sometimes by a less severe one the nature of the soil fashioning it the humour or juices being shut up in definite cavities in the way in which spars are produced in mines gilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing for evidence he incorrectly pointed out that while electrical attraction disappeared with heat magnetic attraction did not although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat hans christian rsted and james clerk maxwell showed that both effects were aspects of a single force electromagnetism maxwell surmised this in his a treatise on electricity and magnetism after much analysis gilberts magnetism was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers such as kepler seized upon incorrectly as governing the motions that they observed while not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to earths rotation and not the rotation of the spheres 20 years before galileo but 57 years after copernicus who stated it openly in his work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium published in 1543 see external reference below gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the moon in the 1590s his chart made without the use of a telescope showed outlines of dark and light patches on the moons face contrary to most of his contemporaries gilbert believed that the light spots on the moon were water and the dark spots land besides gilberts de magnete there appeared at amsterdam in 1651 a quarto volume of 316 pages entitled de mundo nostro sublunari philosophia nova new philosophy about our sublunary world editedsome say by his brother william gilbert junior and others say by the eminent english scholar and critic john gruterfrom two manuscripts found in the library of sir william boswell according to dr john davy this work of gilberts which is so little known is a very remarkable one both in style and matter and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality possessed of a more minute and practical knowledge of natural philosophy than bacon his opposition to the philosophy of the schools was more searching and particular and at the same time probably little less efficient in the opinion of prof john robison de mundo consists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy upon the ruins of the aristotelian doctrine dr william whewell says in his history of the inductive sciences 1859 gilbert in his work de magnete printed in 1600 has only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the earth in some way determines the direction of the earths axis the rate of its diurnal rotation and that of the revolution of the moon about it gilbert died in 1603 and in his posthumous work de mundo nostro sublunari philosophia nova 1631 we have already a more distinct statement of the attraction of one body by another the force which emanates from the moon reaches to the earth and in like manner the magnetic virtue of the earth pervades the region of the moon both correspond and conspire by the joint action of both according to a proportion and conformity of motions but the earth has more effect in consequence of its superior mass the earth attracts and repels the moon and the moon within certain limits the earth not so as to make the bodies come together as magnetic bodies do but so that they may go on in a continuous course though this phraseology is capable of representing a good deal of the truth it does not appear to have been connected with any very definite notions of mechanical action in detail gilbert died on 30 november 1603 in london his cause of death is thought to have been the bubonic plague gilbert was buried in his home town in holy trinity church colchester his marble wall monument can still be seen in this saxon church now deconsecrated and used as a caf and market commentary on gilbert francis bacon never accepted copernican heliocentrism and was critical of gilberts philosophical work in support of the diurnal motion of the earth bacons criticism includes the following two statements the first was repeated in three of his worksin the advancement of learning 1605 novum organum 1620 and de augmentis 1623 the more severe second statement is from history of heavy and light bodies published after bacons death the alchemists have made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace and gilbert our countryman hath made a philosophy out of observations of the lodestone gilbert has himself become a magnet that is he has ascribed too many things to that force and built a ship out of a shell thomas thomson writes in his history of the royal society 1812 the magnetic laws were first generalized and explained by dr gilbert whose book on magnetism published in 1600 is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world it is the more remarkable because it preceded the novum organum of bacon in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained william whewell writes in his history of the inductive sciences 18371859 gilbert repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments he himself no doubt acted up to his own precepts for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science of magnetism so fully examined indeed that even at this day we have little to add to them historian henry hallam wrote of gilbert in his introduction to the literature of europe in the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 1848 the year 1600 was the first in which england produced a remarkable work in physical science but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author gilbert a physician in his latin treatise on the magnet not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages and are almost universally received into the creed of the science the magnetism of the earth itself his own original hypothesis nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia our new and unprecedented view of the planet was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded he relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a terrella or artificial spherical magnet gilbert was also one of our earliest copernicans at least as to the rotation of the earth and with his usual sagacity inferred before the invention of the telescope that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision walter william bryant of the royal observatory greenwich wrote in his book kepler 1920 when gilbert of colchester in his new philosophy founded on his researches in magnetism was dealing with tides he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water but that subterranean spirits and humors rising in sympathy with the moon cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers it appears that an idea presented in some such way as this was more readily received than a plain statement this so-called philosophical method was in fact very generally applied and kepler who shared galileos admiration for gilberts work adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets
