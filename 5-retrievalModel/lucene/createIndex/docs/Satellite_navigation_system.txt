a satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning it allows small electronic receivers to determine their location longitude latitude and altitudeelevation to high precision within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites the system can be used for providing position navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver satellite tracking the signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision which allows time synchronisation satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated a satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system gnss as of october2018 the united states global positioning system gps and russias glonass are fully operational gnsss with chinas beidou navigation satellite system bds and the european unions galileo scheduled to be fully operational by 2020 india france and japan are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 1830 medium earth orbit meo satellites spread between several orbital planes the actual systems vary but use orbital inclinations of 50 and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours at an altitude of about 20000 kilometres or 12000 miles classification satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows gnss-1 is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems gps and glonass with satellite based augmentation systems sbas or ground based augmentation systems gbas in the united states the satellite based component is the wide area augmentation system waas in europe it is the european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos and in japan it is the multi-functional satellite augmentation system msas ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the local area augmentation system laas gnss-2 is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system exemplified by the european galileo positioning system these systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation including aircraft initially this system consisted of only upper l-band frequency sets l1 for gps e1 for galileo g1 for glonass in recent years gnss systems have begun activating lower l-band frequency sets l2 and l5 for gps e5a and e5b for galileo g3 for glonass for civilian use they feature higher aggregate accuracy and fewer problems with signal reflection as of late 2018 a few consumer grade gnss devices are being sold that leverage both and are typically called dual band gnss or dual band gps devices core satellite navigation systems currently gps united states glonass russian federation galileo european union and compass china global satellite based augmentation systems sbas such as omnistar and starfire regional sbas including waas us egnos eu msas japan and gagan india regional satellite navigation systems such as chinas beidou indias navic and japans proposed qzss continental scale ground based augmentation systems gbas for example the australian gras and the joint us coast guard canadian coast guard us army corps of engineers and us department of transportation national differential gps dgps service regional scale gbas such as cors networks local gbas typified by a single gps reference station operating real time kinematic rtk corrections history and theory ground based radio navigation has long been practiced the decca loran gee and omega systems used terrestrial longwave radio transmitters which broadcast a radio pulse from a known master location followed by a pulse repeated from a number of slave stations the delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves providing a fix the first satellite navigation system was transit a system deployed by the us military in the 1960s transits operation was based on the doppler effect the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known radio frequency the received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver by monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellites orbit can fix a particular position satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction among others these were resolved by a team led by harold l jury of pan am aerospace division in florida from 1970-1973 using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation part of an orbiting satellites broadcast included its precise orbital data in order to ensure accuracy the us naval observatory usno continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites as a satellites orbit deviated the usno would send the updated information to the satellite subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent ephemeris modern systems are more direct the satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data from which the position of the satellite can be calculated and the precise time the signal was transmitted the orbital ephemeris is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference the satellite uses an atomic clock to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation the receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three at sea level or four different satellites thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of trilateration see gnss positioning calculation for details each distance measurement regardless of the system being used places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster by taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet a fix is generated however in the case of fast-moving receivers the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites in addition the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere and this slowing varies with the receivers angle to the satellite because that changes the distance through the ionosphere the basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators and then using techniques such as kalman filtering to combine the noisy partial and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position time and velocity applications the original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons see guided bomb satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily reducing the fog of war the ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability the operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires global navigation satellite systems gps the united states global positioning system gps consists of up to 32 medium earth orbit satellites in six different orbital planes with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994 gps is the worlds most utilized satellite navigation system glonass the formerly soviet and now russian globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema global navigation satellite system or glonass is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides a civilian radionavigation-satellite service and is also used by the russian aerospace defence forces glonass has full global coverage with 24 satellites

galileo and gps satellites to greatly increase the accuracy galileo is expected to be in full service in 2020 and at a substantially higher cost the main modulation used in galileo open service signal

navigation systems attributes such as accuracy reliability and availability through the integration of external information into the calculation process for example the wide area augmentation system the european geostationary navigation overlay service the multi-functional satellite augmentation system differential gps gps aided geo augmented navigation gagan and inertial navigation systems doris doppler orbitography and radio-positioning integrated by satellite doris is a french precision navigation system unlike other gnss systems it is based on static emitting stations around the world the receivers being on satellites in order to precisely determine their orbital position the system may be used also for mobile receivers on land with more limited usage and coverage used with traditional gnss systems it pushes the accuracy of positions to centimetric precision and to millimetric precision for altimetric application and also allows monitoring very tiny seasonal changes of earth rotation and deformations in order to build a much more precise geodesic reference system low earth orbit satellite phone networks the two current operational low earth orbit satellite phone networks are able to track transceiver units with accuracy of a few kilometers using doppler shift calculations from the satellite the coordinates are sent back to the transceiver unit where they can be read
