a dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite that is it is in direct orbit of a star and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape usually a spheroid but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit the term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the sun brought about by an increase in discoveries of objects farther away from the sun than neptune that rivaled pluto in size and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object eris the exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the iau has been both praised and criticized as of july 2008 the international astronomical union iau recognizes five dwarf planets ceres in the asteroid belt and pluto haumea makemake and eris in the outer solar system only two of these bodies ceres and pluto have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the iaus definition the iau accepted eris as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than pluto they subsequently decided that unnamed trans-neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than 1 and hence a diameter of 838km assuming a geometric albedo of 1 are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets the classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed history of the concept starting in 1801 astronomers discovered ceres and other bodies between mars and jupiter which were for decades considered to be planets between then and around 1851 when the number of planets had reached 23 astronomers started using the word asteroid for the smaller bodies and then stopped naming or classifying them as planets with the discovery of pluto in 1930 most astronomers considered the solar system to have nine planets along with thousands of significantly smaller bodies asteroids and comets for almost 50years pluto was thought to be larger than mercury but with the discovery in 1978 of plutos moon charon it became possible to measure plutos mass accurately and to determine that it was much smaller than initial estimates it was roughly one-twentieth the mass of mercury which made pluto by far the smallest planet although it was still more than ten times as massive as the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres it had one-fifth the mass of earths moon furthermore having some unusual characteristics such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination it became evident that it was a different kind of body from any of the other planets in the 1990s astronomers began to find objects in the same region of space as pluto now known as the kuiper belt and some even farther away many of these shared several of plutos key orbital characteristics and pluto started being seen as the largest member of a new class of objects plutinos this led some astronomers to stop referring to pluto as a planet several terms including subplanet and planetoid started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets by 2005 three trans-neptunian objects comparable in size to pluto quaoar sedna and eris had been reported it became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets or pluto would have to be reclassified astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as pluto would be discovered and the number of planets would start growing quickly if pluto were to remain a planet eris then known as 2003 ub313 was discovered in january 2005 it was thought to be slightly larger than pluto and some reports informally referred to it as the tenth planet as a consequence the issue became a matter of intense debate during the iau general assembly in august 2006 the iaus initial draft proposal included charon eris and ceres in the list of planets after many astronomers objected to this proposal an alternative was drawn up by the uruguayan astronomers julio ngel fernndez and gonzalo tancredi they proposed an intermediate category for objects large enough to be round but which had not cleared their orbits of planetesimals dropping charon from the list the new proposal also removed pluto ceres and eris because they have not cleared their orbits the iaus final resolution 5a preserved this three-category system for the celestial bodies orbiting the sun it reads although concerns were raised about the classification of planets orbiting other stars the issue was not resolved it was proposed instead to decide this only when such objects start to be observed name the term dwarf planet has itself been somewhat controversial as it could imply that these bodies are planets much as dwarf stars are stars this is the conception of the solar system that stern promoted when he coined the phrase the older word planetoid having the form of a planet has no such connotation and is also used by astronomers for bodies that fit the iau definition brown states that planetoid is a perfectly good word that has been used for these bodies for years and that the use of the term dwarf planet for a non-planet is dumb but that it was motivated by an attempt by the iau division iii plenary session to reinstate pluto as a planet in a second resolution indeed the draft of resolution 5a had called these median bodies planetoids but the plenary session voted unanimously to change the name to dwarf planet the second resolution 5b defined dwarf planets as a subtype of planet as stern had originally intended distinguished from the other eight that were to be called classical planets under this arrangement the twelve planets of the rejected proposal were to be preserved in a distinction between eight classical planets and four dwarf planets resolution 5b was defeated in the same session that 5a was passed because of the semantic inconsistency of a dwarf planet not being a planet due to the failure of resolution 5b alternative terms such as nanoplanet and subplanet were discussed but there was no consensus among the csbn to change it in most languages equivalent terms have been created by translating dwarf planet more-or-less literally french plante naine spanish planeta enano german zwergplanet russian karlikovaya planeta arabic kaukab qazm chinese ixngxng korean waesohangseong but in japanese they are called junwakusei meaning subplanets or almost-planets iau resolution 6a of 2006 recognizes pluto as the prototype of a new category of trans-neptunian objects the name and precise nature of this category were not specified but left for the iau to establish at a later date in the debate leading up to the resolution the members of the category were variously referred to as plutons and plutonian objects but neither name was carried forward perhaps due to objections from geologists that this would create confusion with their pluton on june 11 2008 the iau executive committee announced a name plutoid and a definition all trans-neptunian dwarf planets are plutoids the authority of that initial announcement has not been universally recognized characteristics orbital dominance alan stern and harold f levison introduced a parameter lambda expressing the likelihood of an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit the value of this parameter in sterns model is proportional to the square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period this value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit where 1 will eventually clear it a gap of five orders of magnitude in was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and kuiper belt objects using this parameter steven soter and other astronomers argued for a distinction between planets and dwarf planets based on the inability of the latter to clear the neighbourhood around their orbits planets are able to remove smaller bodies near their orbits by collision capture or gravitational disturbance or establish orbital resonances that prevent collisions whereas dwarf planets lack the mass to do so soter went on to propose a parameter he called the planetary discriminant designated with the symbol mu that represents an experimental measure of the actual degree of cleanliness of the orbital zone where is calculated by dividing the mass of the candidate body by the total mass of the other objects that share its orbital zone where 100 is deemed to be cleared jean-luc margot refined stern and levisons concept to produce a similar parameter pi it is based on theory avoiding the empirical data used by 1 indicates a planet and there is again a gap of several orders of magnitude between planets and dwarf planets there are several other schemes that try to differentiate between planets and dwarf planets but the 2006 definition uses this concept hydrostatic equilibrium sufficient internal pressure caused by the bodys gravitation will turn a body plastic and sufficient plasticity will allow high elevations to sink and hollows to fill in a process known as gravitational relaxation bodies smaller than a few kilometers are dominated by non-gravitational forces and tend to have an irregular shape larger objects where gravitation is significant but not dominant are potato shaped the more massive the body is the higher its internal pressure and the more rounded its shape until the pressure is sufficient to overcome its internal compressive strength and it achieves hydrostatic equilibrium at this point a body is as round as it is possible to be given its rotation and tidal effects and is an ellipsoid in shape this is the defining limit of a dwarf planet when an object is in hydrostatic equilibrium a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid surface of the same shape as the body apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures if the body does not rotate it will be a sphere but the faster it rotates the more oblate or even scalene it becomes if such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted its overall shape would not change when liquid the extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is haumea which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles if the body has a massive nearby companion then tidal forces come into effect as well distorting it into a prolate spheroid an example of this is jupiters moon io which is the most volcanically active body in the solar system due to effects of tidal heating tidal forces also cause a bodys rotation to gradually become tidally locked such that it always presents the same face to its companion an extreme example of this is the plutocharon system where both bodies are tidally locked to each other earths moon is also tidally locked as are many satellites of the gas giants the upper and lower size and mass limits of dwarf planets have not been specified by the iau there is no defined upper limit and an object larger or more massive than mercury that has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit would be classified as a dwarf planet the lower limit is determined by the requirements of achieving a hydrostatic equilibrium shape but the size or mass at which an object attains this shape depends on its composition and thermal history the original draft of the 2006 iau resolution redefined hydrostatic equilibrium shape as applying to objects with mass above 510kg and diameter greater than 800km but this was not retained in the final draft empirical observations suggest that the lower limit will vary according to the composition and thermal history of the object for a body made of rigid silicates such as the stony asteroids the transition to hydrostatic equilibrium should occur at a diameter of approximately 600km and a mass of 3410kg for a body made of less rigid water ice the limit should be about 320km and 10kg in the asteroid belt ceres is the only body that clearly surpasses the silicaceous limit though it is actually a rockyicy body and its shape is an equilibrium spheroid 2 pallas and 4 vesta are rocky and are just below the limit pallas at 525560km and 1852410kg is nearly round but still somewhat irregular vesta at 530km and 2610kg deviates from an ellipsoid shape primarily due to a large impact basin at its pole dwarf planets and possible dwarf planets many trans-neptunian objects tnos are thought to have icy cores and therefore would require a diameter of perhaps 400km 250mionly about 3 of that of earthto relax into gravitational equilibrium as of january2015 about 150 known tnos are considered potential dwarf planets although only rough estimates of the diameters of most of these objects are available a team is investigating thirty of these and think that the number will eventually prove to be around 200 in the kuiper belt with thousands more beyond recognized the iau has recognized five bodies as dwarf planets since 2008 ceres pluto eris haumea and makemake ceres and pluto are known to be dwarf planets through direct observation eris is recognized as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than pluto measurements by new horizons indicate that plutos diameter is larger than that of eris whereas haumea and makemake qualify based on their absolute magnitudes in relative distance from the sun the five are ceres discovered on january 1 1801 45years before neptune considered a planet for half a century before reclassification as an asteroid accepted as a dwarf planet by the iau on september 13 2006 pluto discovered on february 18 1930 classified as a planet for 76years reclassified as a dwarf planet by the iau on august 24 2006 haumea discovered on december 28 2004 accepted by the iau as a dwarf planet on september 17 2008 makemake discovered on march 31 2005 accepted by the iau as a dwarf planet on july 11 2008 eris discovered on january 5 2005 called the tenth planet in media reports accepted by the iau as a dwarf planet on september 13 2006 proposed liberal estimates are that another hundred or so known objects in the solar system may be dwarf planets such estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets will be identified when the entire region known as the kuiper belt is explored and that the number may exceed 10000 when objects scattered outside the kuiper belt are considered individual astronomers recognize several of these and brown maintains a list of hundreds of candidate objects ranging from nearly certain to possible dwarf planets however it has been proposed that dark low-density bodies smaller than 9001000 km in diameter may retain internal porosity from their formation never having fully collapsed into solid planetary bodies in which case they could not be dwarf-planets as of feb 2018 browns list includes 952 objects identifying ten known trans-neptunian objectsthe four accepted by the iau plus the six bodies 2007 or10 quaoar sedna orcus 307261 2002 ms4 and salaciaas near certain with another 26 highly likely notably 2007 or10 1535 km has a larger diameter than the dwarf planet makemake 1430 km stern states that there are more than a dozen known dwarf planets grundy et al cast doubt on the possibility that salacia varda and similar objects are planetary bodies while accepting that orcus and quaoar probably are mike brown considers an additional six trans-neptunian objects to be nearly certainly dwarf planets with diameters at or above 900 kilometers these objects are quaoar discovered on june 5 2002 2002 ms4 discovered on june 18 2002 sedna discovered on november 14 2003 orcus discovered on february 17 2004 salacia discovered on september 22 2004 2007 or10 discovered on july 17 2007 tancredi et al advised the iau to officially accept orcus sedna and quaoar in addition gonzalo tancredi considers the five tnos varuna ixion 2003 az84 2004 gv9 and 2002 aw197 to be dwarf planets as well vesta the next-most-massive body in the asteroid belt after ceres is roughly spherical deviating mainly because of massive impacts that formed rheasilvia and veneneia crater after it solidified furthermore its triaxial dimensions are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium triton is thought to be a captured dwarf planet phoebe is a captured body that like vesta is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium but is thought to have been so early in its history exploration on march 6 2015 the dawn spacecraft began to orbit ceres becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet on july 14 2015 the new horizons space probe flew by pluto and its five moons dawn has also explored the former dwarf planet vesta phoebe has been explored by cassini most recently and voyager 2 which also explored triton these three are thought to be former dwarf planets and therefore their exploration helps in the study of the evolution of dwarf planets contention in the immediate aftermath of the iau definition of dwarf planet some scientists expressed their disagreement with the iau resolution campaigns included car bumper stickers and t-shirts mike brown the discoverer of eris agrees with the reduction of the number of planets to eight nasa has announced that it will use the new guidelines established by the iau alan stern the director of nasas mission to pluto rejects the current iau definition of planet both in terms of defining dwarf planets as something other than a type of planet and in using orbital characteristics rather than intrinsic characteristics of objects to define them as dwarf planets thus in 2011 he still referred to pluto as a planet and accepted other dwarf planets such as ceres and eris as well as the larger moons as additional planets several years before the iau definition he used orbital characteristics to separate berplanets the dominant eight from unterplanets the dwarf planets considering both types planets planetary-mass moons nineteen moons are known to be massive enough to have relaxed into a rounded shape under their own gravity and seven of them are more massive than either eris or pluto they are not physically distinct from the dwarf planets but are not dwarf planets because they do not directly orbit the sun the seven that are more massive than eris are the moon the four galilean moons of jupiter io europa ganymede and callisto one moon of saturn titan and one moon of neptune triton the others are six moons of saturn mimas enceladus tethys dione rhea and iapetus five moons of uranus miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon and one moon of pluto charon there are additional possibilities among tnos including dysnomia orbiting eris alan stern calls these moons satellite planets one of three categories of planet together with dwarf planets and classical planets the term planemo planetary-mass object covers all three in a draft resolution for the iau definition of planet both pluto and charon would have been considered dwarf planets in a binary system given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies rather than within one of the bodies the iau currently states that charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of pluto although the idea that charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date the location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies but also on the distance between them the barycenter of the sunjupiter orbit for example lies outside the sun see also lists of astronomical objects centaur list of gravitationally rounded objects of the solar system list of planetary bodies
