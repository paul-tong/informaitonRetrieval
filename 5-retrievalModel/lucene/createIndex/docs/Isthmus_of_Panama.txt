the isthmus of panama spanish istmo de panam also historically known as the isthmus of darien istmo de darin is the narrow strip of land that lies between the caribbean sea and the pacific ocean linking north and south america it contains the country of panama and the panama canal like many isthmuses it is a location of great strategic value the isthmus formed around 28 million years ago this major geological event separated the atlantic and pacific oceans and caused the creation of the gulf stream this was first suggested in 1910 by north american paleontologist henry fairfield osborn he based the proposal on the fossil record of mammals in central america this conclusion provided a foundation for alfred wegener when he proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912 history vasco nez de balboa heard of the south sea from natives while sailing along the caribbean coast on 25 september 1513 he saw the pacific in 1519 the town of panam was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the pacific coast after the discovery of peru it developed into an important port of trade and became an administrative centre in 1671 the welsh pirate henry morgan crossed the isthmus of panam from the caribbean side and destroyed the city the town was relocated some kilometers to the west at a small peninsula the ruins of the old town panam viejo are preserved and were declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 silver and gold from the viceroyalty of peru were transported overland across the isthmus by spanish silver train to porto bello where spanish treasure fleets shipped them to seville and cdiz from 1707 lionel wafer spent four years between 1680 and 1684 among the cuna indians scotland tried to establish a settlement in 1698 through the darien scheme the california gold rush starting in 1849 brought a large increase in the transportation of people from the atlantic to the pacific steamships brought gold diggers from eastern us ports who trekked across the isthmus by foot horse and later rail on the pacific side they boarded pacific mail steamship company vessels headed for san francisco ferdinand de lesseps the man behind the suez canal started a panama canal company in 1880 that went bankrupt in 1889 in the panama scandals in 19024 the united states forced colombia to grant independence to the department of the isthmus bought the remaining assets of the panama canal company and finished the canal in 1914 geology a significant body of water referred to as the central american seaway once separated the continents of north and south america allowing the waters of the pacific and atlantic oceans to mix freely beneath the surface two plates of the earths crust were slowly colliding forcing the cocos plate to slide under the caribbean plate the pressure and heat caused by this collision led to the formation of underwater volcanoes some of which grew large enough to form islands as early as 15 million years ago meanwhile movement of the two tectonic plates was also pushing up the sea floor eventually forcing some areas above sea level over time massive amounts of sediment sand soil and mud from north and south america filled the gaps between the newly forming islands over millions of years the sediment deposits added to the islands until the gaps were completely filled by no later than 45 million years ago an isthmus had formed between north and south america however an article in science magazine stated that zircon crystals in middle miocene bedrock from northern colombia indicated that by 10 million years ago it is likely that instead of islands a full isthmus between the north and south american continents had already likely formed where the central american seaway had been previously evidence also suggests that the creation of this land mass and the subsequent warm wet weather over northern europe resulted in the formation of a large arctic ice cap and contributed to the current ice age that warm currents can lead to glacier formation may seem counterintuitive but heated air flowing over the warm gulf stream can hold more moisture the result is increased precipitation that contributes to snow pack the formation of the isthmus of panama also played a major role in biodiversity on the planet the bridge made it easier for animals and plants to migrate between the two continents this event is known in paleontology as the great american interchange for instance in north america today the opossum armadillo and porcupine all trace back to ancestors that came across the land bridge from south america likewise bears cats dogs horses llamas and raccoons all made the trek south across the isthmus biosphere as the connecting bridge between two vast land masses the panamanian biosphere is filled with overlapping fauna and flora from both north and south america there are for example over 978 species of birds in the isthmus area the tropical climate also encourages a myriad of large and brightly colored species insects amphibians birds fish and reptiles divided along its length by a mountain range the isthmuss weather is generally wet on the atlantic caribbean side but has a clearer division into wet and dry seasons on the pacific side see also darien gap isthmo-colombian area postage stamps and postal history of the canal zone notes sources
