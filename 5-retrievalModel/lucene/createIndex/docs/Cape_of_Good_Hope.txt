the cape of good hope afrikaans kaap die goeie hoop kp di uj p dutch kaap de goede hoop kab d ud op listen portuguese cabo da boa esperana kau o ps is a rocky headland on the atlantic coast of the cape peninsula in south africa a common misconception is that the cape of good hope is the southern tip of africa this misconception was based on the misbelief that the cape was the dividing point between the atlantic and indian oceans contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of africa is cape agulhas about 150 kilometres 90mi to the east-southeast the currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water agulhas current meets the cold-water benguela current and turns back on itself that oceanic meeting point fluctuates between cape agulhas and cape point about 12 kilometres 075mi east of the cape of good hope when following the western side of the african coastline from the equator however the cape of good hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward thus the first modern rounding of the cape in 1488 by portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias was a milestone in the attempts by the portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the far east although herodotus mentioned a claim that the phoenicians had done so far earlier dias called the cape cabo das tormentas cape of storms dutch stormkaap which was the original name of the cape of good hope as one of the great capes of the south atlantic ocean the cape of good hope has long been of special significance to sailors many of whom refer to it simply as the cape it is a waypoint on the cape route and the clipper route followed by clipper ships to the far east and australia and still followed by several offshore yacht races the term cape of good hope is also used in three other ways it is a section of the table mountain national park within which the cape of the same name as well as cape point falls prior to its incorporation into the national park this section constituted the cape point nature reserve it was the name of the early cape colony established by the dutch in 1652 on the cape peninsula just before the union of south africa was formed the term referred to the entire region that in 1910 was to become the cape of good hope province usually shortened to the cape province history eudoxus of cyzicus judkss greek edoxos fl c 130 bc was a greek navigator for ptolemy viii king of the hellenistic ptolemaic dynasty in egypt who found the wreck of a ship in the indian ocean that appeared to have come from gades todays cdiz in spain rounding the cape when eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to india the wind forced him south of the gulf of aden and down the coast of africa for some distance somewhere along the coast of east africa he found the remains of the ship due to its appearance and the story told by the natives eudoxus concluded that the ship was from gades and had sailed anti-clockwise around africa passing the cape and entering the indian ocean this inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a circumnavigation of the continent organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from gades and began to work down the african coast the difficulties were too great however and he was obliged to return to europe after this failure he again set out to circumnavigate africa his eventual fate is unknown although some such as pliny claimed that eudoxus did achieve his goal the most probable conclusion is that he perished on the journey in the 1450 fra mauro map the indian ocean is depicted as connected to the atlantic fra mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of africa which he names the cape of diab describing the exploration by a ship from the east around 1420 around 1420 a ship or junk from india crossed the sea of india towards the island of men and the island of women off cape diab between the green islands and the shadows it sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction without ever finding anything other than wind and water according to these people themselves the ship went some 2000 miles ahead until - once favourable conditions came to an end - it turned round and sailed back to cape diab in 70 days the ships called junks lit zonchi that navigate these seas carry four masts or more some of which can be raised or lowered and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller they can navigate without a compass because they have an astrologer who stands on the side and with an astrolabe in hand gives orders to the navigator text from the fra mauro map 09-p25 fra mauro explained that he obtained the information from a trustworthy source who traveled with the expedition possibly the venetian explorer niccol da conti who happened to be in calicut india at the time the expedition left what is more i have spoken with a person worthy of trust who says that he sailed in an indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in the sea of india beyond the cape of soffala and the green islands towards west-southwest and according to the astrologers who act as their guides they had advanced almost 2000 miles thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those and that they had therefore sailed 4000 miles fra mauro also comments that the account of the expedition together with the relation by strabo of the travels of eudoxus of cyzicus from arabia to gibraltar through the southern ocean in antiquity led him to believe that the indian ocean was not a closed sea and that africa could be circumnavigated by her southern end text from fra mauro map 11 g2 this knowledge together with the map depiction of the african continent probably encouraged the portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of africa in the early modern era the first european to reach the cape was the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias on 12 march 1488 who named it the cape of storms cabo das tormentas it was later renamed by john ii of portugal as cape of good hope cabo da boa esperana because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to india and the east the khoikhoi people lived in the cape area when the dutch first settled there in 1652 the khoikhoi had arrived in this area about fifteen hundred years before the dutch called them hottentots a term that has now come to be regarded as pejorative dutch colonial administrator jan van riebeeck established a resupply camp for the dutch east india company some 50km north of the cape in table bay on 6 april 1652 and this eventually developed into cape town supplies of fresh food were vital on the long journey around africa and cape town became known as the tavern of the seas on 31 december 1687 a community of huguenots french protestants arrived at the cape of good hope from the netherlands they had escaped from france and fled to the netherlands to flee religious persecution in france one example was pierre joubert who came from la motte-daigues the dutch east india company needed skilled farmers at the cape of good hope and the dutch government saw opportunities to settle huguenots at the cape and sent them there the cape colony gradually grew over the next 150 years or so until it stretched for hundreds of kilometres to the north and north-east during the napoleonic wars the dutch republic was occupied by the french in 1795 thus the cape colony became a french vassal and enemy of the british therefore the united kingdom invaded and occupied the cape colony that same year the british relinquished control of the territory in 1803 but returned and reoccupied the colony on 19 january 1806 following the battle of blaauwberg the dutch ceded the territory to the british in the anglo-dutch treaty of 1814 the cape was then administered as the cape colony and it remained a british colony until it was incorporated into the independent union of south africa in 1910 now known as the republic of south africa the portuguese government erected two navigational beacons dias cross and da gama cross to commemorate vasco da gama and bartolomeu dias as explorers who

shipping hazard in false bay two other beacons in simons town provide the intersection geography the cape of good hope is at the southern tip of the cape peninsula about 23kilometres 14mi west and a little south of cape point on the south-east corner cape town is about 50 kilometres to the north of the cape in table bay at the north end of the peninsula the peninsula forms the western boundary of false bay geologically the rocks found at the two capes and indeed over much of the peninsula are part of the cape supergroup and are formed of the same type of sandstones as table mountain itself both the cape of good hope and cape point offer spectacular scenery the whole of the southernmost portion of the cape peninsula is a wild rugged scenic and generally unspoiled national park the term the cape has also been used in a wider sense to indicate the area of the european colony centred on cape town and the later south african province since 1994 it has been broken up into three smaller provinces the western cape eastern cape and northern cape parts of the province were also absorbed into the north west fauna with its diverse habitat ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea the cape of good hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of african penguins bush birds tend to be rather scarce because of the coarse scrubby nature of fynbos vegetation when flowering however proteas and ericas attract sunbirds sugarbirds and other species in search of nectar for most of the year there are more small birds in coastal thicket than in fynbos the cape of good hope section of table mountain national park is home to several species of antelope bontebok and eland are easily seen and red hartebeest can be seen in the grazing lawns in smitswinkel flats grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce but may be observed along the beach hills at olifantsbos most visitors are unlikely to ever see either cape grysbok or klipspringer the cape of good hope section is home to four cape mountain zebra they might be seen by the attentive or lucky visitor usually in smitswinkel flats there are a wealth of small animals such as lizards snakes tortoises and insects small mammals include rock hyrax four-striped grass mouse water mongoose cape clawless otter and fallow deer the area offers excellent vantage points for whale watching the southern right whale is the species most likely to be seen in false bay between june and november other species are the humpback whale and brydes whale seals dusky dolphins and killer whales have also been seen the strategic position of the cape of good hope between two major ocean currents ensures a rich diversity of marine life there is a difference between the sea life west of cape point and that to the east due to the markedly differing sea temperatures the south african marine living resources act is strictly enforced throughout the table mountain national park and especially in marine protected areas disturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between schusters bay and hoek van bobbejaan but is allowed in other areas during season and with relevant permits chacma baboons chacma baboons papio ursinus are the mammals most intimately associated with the cape of good hope baboons inside the cape of good hope section of the park are a major tourist attraction there are 11 troops consisting of about 375 individuals throughout the entire cape peninsula six of these 11 troops either live entirely within the cape of good hope section of the park or use the section as part of their range the cape point kanonkop klein olifantsbos and buffels bay troops live entirely inside the cape of good hope section of the park the groot olifantsbos and plateau road troops range into the park chacma baboons are widely distributed across southern africa and are classified as least concern in the iucn red list of threatened species however the south african parks department states in its publication mountains in the sea that the baboon population on the cape is critically endangered this is due to habitat loss genetic isolation and conflicts with humans cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their range across the cape peninsula and the cape of good hope section of table mountain national park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within its boundaries it provides relative safety from nearby towns where people have killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food baboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and by electrocution on power lines inside the park some management policies such as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause detriment to the troops as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to the park flora the cape of good hope is an integral part of the cape floristic kingdom the smallest but richest of the worlds six floral kingdoms this comprises a treasure trove of 1100 species of indigenous plants of which a number are endemic occur naturally nowhere else on earth the main type of fynbos fine bush vegetation at the cape of good hope is peninsula sandstone fynbos an endangered vegetation type that is endemic to the cape peninsula coastal hangklip sand fynbos grows on low-lying alkaline sands and right by the sea small patches of cape flats dune strandveld can be found characteristic fynbos plants include proteas ericas heath and restios reeds some of the most striking and well-known members belong to the proteacae family of which up to 24 species occur these include king protea sugarbush tree pincushion and golden cone bush leucadendron laureolum many popular horticultural plants like pelargoniums freesias daisies lilies and irises also have their origins in fynbos legends the cape of good hope is the legendary home of the flying dutchman crewed by tormented and damned ghostly sailors it is doomed forever to beat its way through the adjacent waters without ever succeeding in rounding the headland adamastor is a greek-type mythological character invented by the portuguese poet lus de cames in his epic poem os lusadas first printed in 1572 as a symbol of the forces of nature portuguese navigators had to overcome during their discoveries and
