iceland icelandic sland istlant is a nordic island country in the north atlantic with a population of 348580 and an area of 103000km 40000sqmi making it the most sparsely populated country in europe the capital and largest city is reykjavk with reykjavk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country being home to over two-thirds of the population iceland is volcanically and geologically active the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate according to the ancient manuscript landnmabk the settlement of iceland began in 874 ad when the norwegian chieftain inglfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island in the following centuries norwegians and to a lesser extent other scandinavians emigrated to iceland bringing with them thralls ie slaves or serfs of gaelic origin the island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the althing one of the worlds oldest functioning legislative assemblies following a period of civil strife iceland acceded to norwegian rule in the 13th century the establishment of the kalmar union in 1397 united the kingdoms of norway denmark and sweden iceland thus followed norways integration into that union coming under danish rule after swedens secession from the union in 1523 although the danish kingdom introduced lutheranism forcefully in 1550 iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence in the wake of the french revolution and the napoleonic wars icelands struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 until the 20th century iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture and was among the poorest countries in europe industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world in 1994 it became a part of the european economic area which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance biotechnology and manufacturing iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd countries it maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens iceland ranks high in economic democratic social stability and equality currently ranking first in the world by median wealth per adult in 2018 it was ranked as the sixth most developed country in the world by the united nations human development index and it ranks first on the global peace index iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy hit hard by the worldwide financial crisis the nations entire banking system systemically failed in october 2008 leading to a severe depression substantial political unrest the icesave dispute and the institution of capital controls some bankers were jailed since then the economy has made a significant recovery in large part due to a surge in tourism a law that took effect in 2018 makes it illegal in iceland for women to be paid less than men icelandic culture is founded upon the nations scandinavian heritage most icelanders are descendants of norse and gaelic settlers icelandic a north germanic language is descended from old west norse and is closely related to faroese and west norwegian dialects the countrys cultural heritage includes traditional icelandic cuisine icelandic literature and medieval sagas iceland has the smallest population of any nato member and is the only one with no standing army with a lightly armed coast guard etymology the sagas of icelanders say that a norwegian named naddodd or naddador was the first norseman to reach iceland and in the 9th century he named it snland or snow land because it was snowing following naddodd the swede garar svavarsson arrived and so the island was then called gararshlmur which means garars isle then came a viking named flki vilgerarson his daughter drowned en route then his livestock starved to death the sagas say that the rather despondent flki climbed a mountain and saw a fjord arnarfjrur full of icebergs which led him to give the island its new and present name the notion that icelands viking settlers chose that name to discourage oversettlement of their verdant isle is a myth history 8741262 settlement and commonwealth according to both landnmabk and slendingabk monks known as the papar lived in iceland before scandinavian settlers arrived possibly members of a hiberno-scottish mission recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in hafnir on the reykjanes peninsula carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 in 2016 archeologists uncovered a longhouse in stvarfjrur that has been dated to as early as 800 swedish viking explorer garar svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island he stayed over winter and built a house in hsavk garar departed the following summer but one of his men nttfari decided to stay behind with two slaves nttfari settled in what is now known as nttfaravk and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of iceland the norwegian-norse chieftain inglfr arnarson built his homestead in present-day reykjavk in 874 inglfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers largely scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were irish or scottish by 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth lack of arable land also served as an impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986 the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century at this time about 25 of iceland was covered with forest compared to 1 in the present day christianity was adopted by consensus around 9991000 although norse paganism persisted among segments of the population for some years afterwards the middle ages the icelandic commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of icelandic chieftains the internal struggles and civil strife of the age of the sturlungs led to the signing of the old covenant in 1262 which ended the commonwealth and brought iceland under the norwegian crown possession of iceland passed from the kingdom of norway 8721397 to the kalmar union in 1415 when the kingdoms of norway denmark and sweden were united after the break-up of the union in 1523 it remained a norwegian dependency as a part of denmarknorway in the ensuing centuries iceland became one of the poorest countries in europe infertile soil volcanic eruptions deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture the black death swept iceland twice first in 14021404 and again in 14941495 the former outbreak killed 50 to 60 of the population and the latter 30 to 50 reformation and the early modern period around the middle of the 16th century as part of the protestant reformation king christian iii of denmark began to impose lutheranism on all his subjects jn arason the last catholic bishop of hlar was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons the country subsequently became officially lutheran and lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion in the 17th and 18th centuries denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on iceland natural disasters including volcanic eruption and disease contributed to a decreasing population pirates from several countries including the barbary coast raided icelands coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery a great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population in 1783 the laki volcano erupted with devastating effects in the years following the eruption known as the mist hardships icelandic muharindin over half of all livestock in the country died around a quarter of the population starved to death in the ensuing famine 18141918 independence movement in 1814 following the napoleonic wars denmark-norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the treaty of kiel but iceland remained a danish dependency throughout the 19th century the countrys climate continued to grow colder resulting in mass emigration to the new world particularly to the region of gimli manitoba in canada which was sometimes referred to as new iceland about 15000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70000 a national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland europe an icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of jn sigursson based on the burgeoning icelandic nationalism inspired by the fjlnismenn and other danish-educated icelandic intellectuals in 1874 denmark granted iceland a constitution and limited home rule this was expanded in 1904 and hannes hafstein served as the first minister for iceland in the danish cabinet 19181944 independence and the kingdom of iceland the danishicelandic act of union an agreement with denmark signed on 1 december 1918 and valid for 25years recognised iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a personal union with denmark the government of iceland established an embassy in copenhagen and requested that denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters subject to consultation with the althing danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags those of the kingdom of denmark and those of the kingdom of iceland icelands legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the commonwealth of nations such as canada whose sovereign is queen elizabeth ii during world war ii iceland joined denmark in asserting neutrality after the german occupation of denmark on 9 april 1940 the althing replaced the king with a regent and declared that the icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs a month later british armed forces invaded and occupied the country violating icelandic neutrality in 1941 the government of iceland invited the united states to take over its defence so that britain could use its troops elsewhere 1944present republic of iceland on 31 december 1943 the danishicelandic act of union expired after 25years beginning on 20 may 1944 icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with denmark abolish the monarchy and establish a republic the vote was 97 to end the union and 95 in favour of the new republican constitution iceland formally became a republic on 17 june 1944 with sveinn bjrnsson as its first president in 1946 the us defence force allied left iceland the nation formally became a member of nato on 30 march 1949 amid domestic controversy and riots on 5 may 1951 a defence agreement was signed with the united states american troops returned to iceland as the iceland defence force and remained throughout the cold war the us withdrew the last of its forces on 30 september 2006 iceland prospered during the second world war the immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the us marshall plan programme through which icelanders received the most aid per capita of any european country at us209 with the war-ravaged netherlands a distant second at us109 the 1970s were marked by the cod warsseveral disputes with the united kingdom over icelands extension of its fishing limits to 200nmi 370km offshore iceland hosted a summit in reykjavk in 1986 between united states president ronald reagan and soviet premier mikhail gorbachev during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament a few years later iceland became the first country to recognise the independence of estonia latvia and lithuania as they broke away from the ussr throughout the 1990s the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes to that end iceland provided aid and expertise to various nato-led interventions in bosnia kosovo and iraq iceland joined the european economic area in 1994 after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised international economic relations increased further after 2001 when icelands newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt contributing to a 32 increase in icelands gross national income between 2002 and 2007 economic boom and crisis in 20032007 following the privatisation of the banking sector under the government of dav oddsson iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services it was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis the crisis resulted in the greatest migration from iceland since 1887 with a net emigration of 5000 people in 2009 icelands economy stabilised under the government of jhanna sigurardttir and grew by 16 in 2012 the centre-right independence party was returned to power in coalition with the progressive party in the 2013 elections in the following years iceland saw a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination in 2016 prime minister sigmundur david gunnlaugsson resigned after being implicated in the panama papers scandal early elections in 2016 resulted in a right-wing coalition government of the independence party the reform party and bright future this government fell when bright future quit the coalition due to a scandal involving then-prime minister bjarni benediktssons fathers letter of support for a convicted paedophile snap elections in october 2017 brought to power a new coalition consisting of the independence party the progressive party and the left-green movement headed by

grmsey off the main islands northern coast the country lies between latitudes 63 and 68n and longitudes 25 and 13w iceland is closer to continental europe than to mainland north america although it is closest to greenland 290km 180mi an island of north america iceland is generally included in europe for geographical historical political cultural linguistic and practical reasons geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates the closest bodies of land in europe are the faroe islands 420km 260mi jan mayen island 570km 350mi shetland and the outer hebrides both about 740km

the northern tip of labrador iceland is the worlds 18th largest island and europes second-largest island after great britain the island of ireland is third the main island is 101826km 39315sqmi but the entire country is 103000km 40000sqmi in size of which 627 is tundra about 30 minor islands are in iceland including the lightly populated grmsey and the vestmannaeyjar archipelago lakes and

is the deepest lake at 248m 814ft geologically iceland is part of the mid-atlantic ridge a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust this part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume causing iceland to be subaerial above the surface of the sea the ridge marks the boundary between the eurasian and north american plates and iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge many fjords punctuate icelands 4970-km-long 3088-mi coastline which is also where most settlements are situated the islands interior the highlands of iceland is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand mountains and lava fields the major towns are the capital city of reykjavk along with its outlying towns of kpavogur hafnarfjrur and garabr nearby reykjanesbr where the international airport is located and the town of akureyri in northern iceland the island of grmsey on the arctic circle contains the northernmost habitation of iceland whereas kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of iceland iceland has three national parks vatnajkull national park snfellsjkull national park and ingvellir national park the country is considered a strong performer in environmental protection having been ranked 13th in yale universitys environmental performance index of 2012 iceland as seen from space on 29 january 2004 iceland as seen from

laugavegur hiking trail geology a geologically young land iceland is the surface expression of the iceland plateau a large igneous province forming as a result of volcanism from the iceland hotspot and along the mid-atlantic ridge the latter of which runs right through it this means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes including hekla eldgj herubrei and eldfell the volcanic eruption of laki in 17831784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the islands population in addition the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of europe and parts of asia and africa for several months afterward and affected climates in other areas iceland has many geysers including geysir from which the english word is derived and the famous strokkur which erupts every 810minutes after a phase of inactivity geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000 geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often with the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity most residents have access to inexpensive hot water heating and electricity the island is composed primarily of basalt a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in hawaii iceland however has a variety of volcanic types composite and fissure many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with about 30 active volcanic systems surtsey one of the youngest islands in the world is part of iceland named after surtr it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 november 1963 and 5 june 1968 only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island on 21 march 2010 a volcano in eyjafjallajkull in the south of iceland erupted for the first time since 1821 forcing 600 people to flee their homes additional eruptions on 14 april forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across europe another large eruption occurred on 21 may 2011 this time it was the grmsvtn volcano located under the thick ice of europes largest glacier vatnajkull grmsvtn is one of icelands most active volcanoes and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 eyjafjallajkull activity with ash and lava hurled 20km 12mi into the atmosphere creating a large cloud the highest elevation for iceland is listed as 2110 m 6923ft at hvannadalshnkur 6400n 1639w climate the climate of icelands coast is subarctic the warm north atlantic current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world regions in the world with similar climates include the aleutian islands the alaska peninsula and tierra del fuego although these regions are closer to the equator despite its proximity to the arctic the islands coasts remain ice-free through the winter ice incursions are rare the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969 the climate varies between different parts of the island generally speaking the south coast is warmer wetter and windier than the north the central highlands are the coldest part of the country low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south the highest air temperature recorded was 305c 869f on 22 june 1939 at teigarhorn on the southeastern coast the lowest was 38c 364f on 22 january 1918 at grmsstair and mrudalur in the northeastern hinterland the temperature records for reykjavk are 262c 792f on 30 july 2008 and 245c 121f on 21 january 1918 plants phytogeographically iceland belongs to the arctic province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom around three-quarters of the island is barren of vegetation plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock the most common tree native to iceland is the northern birch betula pubescens which formerly formed forests over much of iceland along with aspens populus tremula rowans sorbus aucuparia common junipers juniperus communis and other smaller trees mainly willows when the island was first settled it was extensively forested with 30 of the land covered in trees in the late 12th century ari the wise described it in the slendingabk as forested from mountain to sea shore permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber deforestation climatic deterioration during the little ice age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion today many farms have been abandoned three-quarters of icelands 100000 square kilometres is affected by soil erosion 18000km 6900sqmi serious enough to make the land useless only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves the planting of new forests has increased the number of trees but the result does not compare to the original forests some of the planted forests include introduced species the tallest tree in iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in kirkjubjarklaustur it was measured at 252m 83ft in 2013 animals the only native land mammal when humans arrived was the arctic fox which came to the island at the end of the ice age walking over the frozen sea on rare occasions bats have been carried to the island with the winds but they are not able to breed there polar bears occasionally come over from greenland but they are just visitors and no icelandic populations exist no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians are on the island the animals of iceland include the icelandic sheep cattle chickens goats the sturdy icelandic horse and the icelandic sheepdog all descendants of animals imported by europeans wild mammals include the arctic fox mink mice rats rabbits and reindeer polar bears occasionally visit the island travelling on icebergs from greenland in june 2008 two polar bears arrived in the same month marine mammals include the grey seal halichoerus grypus and harbor seal phoca vitulina many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding iceland and the fishing industry is a major part of icelands economy accounting for roughly half of the countrys total exports birds especially seabirds are an important part of icelands animal life puffins skuas and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs commercial whaling is practised intermittently along with scientific whale hunts whale watching has become an important part of icelands economy since 1997 around 1300 species of insects are known in iceland this is low compared with other countries over one million species have been described worldwide iceland is essentially free of mosquitoes politics iceland has a leftright multi-party system following the 2017 parliamentary election the biggest parties are the centre-right independence party sjlfstisflokkurinn the left-green movement vinstrihreyfingin grnt frambo and the progressive party framsknarflokkurinn these three parties form the current ruling coalition in the cabinet led by leftist katrn jakobsdttir other political parties with seats in the althing parliament are the social democratic alliance samfylkingin the centre party miflokkurinn icelands pirates the peoples party flokkur flksins and the reform party vireisn iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women known as the womens list or womens alliance kvennalistinn it was founded in 1983 to advance the political economic and social needs of women after participating in its first parliamentary elections the womens list helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15 it disbanded in 1999 formally merging the next year with the social democratic alliance although about half of its members joined the left-green movement instead it did leave a lasting influence on icelands politics every major party has a 40 quota for women and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female compared to the global average of 16 following the 2016 elections 48 of members of parliament are female in 2016 iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions and 13th in government transparency the country has a high level of civic participation with 814 voter turnout during the most recent elections compared to an oecd average of 72 however only 50 of icelanders say they trust their political institutions slightly less than the oecd average of 56 and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the icelandic financial crisis government iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic the modern parliament alingi english althing was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch it was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 consequently it is arguably the worlds oldest parliamentary democracy it currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit the elections for president the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum the current president is guni th jhannesson the head of government is the prime minister who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent sveinn bjrnsson who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941 appointed a non-parliamentary government the regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and sveinn would later become the countrys first president in 1944 the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently in 1980 icelanders elected vigds finnbogadttir as president the worlds first directly elected female head of state she retired from office in 1996 in 2009 iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when jhanna sigurardttir became prime minister administrative divisions iceland is divided into regions constituencies and municipalities the eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division until 2003 the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies reykjavk north and reykjavk south city regions southwest four non-contiguous suburban areas around reykjavk northwest and northeast northern half of iceland split and south southern half of iceland excluding reykjavk and suburbs the redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjavk city area the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system but still exists 74 municipalities in iceland govern local matters like schools transport and zoning these are the actual second-level subdivisions of iceland as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes reykjavk is by far the most populous municipality about four times more populous than kpavogur the second one regions of iceland regions of iceland constituencies of iceland constituencies of iceland municipalities of iceland municipalities of iceland foreign relations iceland which is a member of the un nato efta council of europe and oecd maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations but its ties with the nordic countries germany the united states canada and the other nato nations are particularly close historically due to cultural economic and linguistic similarities iceland is a nordic country and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the nordic council iceland is a member of the european economic area eea which allows the country access to the single market of the european union eu it was not a member of the eu but in july 2009 the icelandic parliament the althing voted in favour of application for eu membership and officially applied on 17 july 2009 however in 2013 opinion polls showed that many icelanders were now against joining the eu following 2013 elections the two parties that formed the islands new governmentthe centrist progressive party and the right-wing independence partyannounced they would hold a referendum on eu membership military iceland has no standing army but the icelandic coast guard which also maintains the iceland air defence system and an iceland crisis response unit to support peacekeeping missions and perform paramilitary functions the iceland defense force idf was a military command of the united states armed forces from 1951 to 2006 the idf created at the request of nato came into existence when the united states signed an agreement to provide for the defense of iceland the idf also consisted of civilian icelanders and military members of other nato nations the idf was downsized after the end of the cold war and the us air force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the naval air station keflavik until they were withdrawn on 30 september 2006 since may 2008 nato nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol icelandic airspace under the icelandic air policing mission iceland supported the 2003 invasion of iraq despite much domestic controversy deploying a coast guard eod team to iraq which was replaced later by members of the iceland crisis response unit iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in afghanistan and the 1999 nato bombing of yugoslavia despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 april 2009 iceland was the neutral host of the historic 1986 reagangorbachev summit in reykjavk which set the stage for the end of the cold war icelands principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights conflict with the united kingdom led to a series of so-called cod wars which included confrontations between the icelandic coast guard and the royal navy over british fishermen in 19521956 due to the extension of icelands fishing zone from 3 to 4nmi 56 to 74km 35 to 46mi 19581961 following a further extension to 12nmi 222km 138mi 19721973 with another extension to 50nmi 926km 575mi and in 19751976 another extension to 200nmi 3704km 2302mi according to the global peace index iceland is the most peaceful country in the world due to its lack of armed forces low crime rate and high level of socio-political stability iceland is listed in the guinness world records book as the country ranked most at peace and the lowest military spending per capita economy in 2007 iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita us54858 and the fifth most productive by gdp at purchasing power parity 40112 about 85 percent of total primary energy supply in iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources utilisation of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made iceland the worlds largest electricity producer per capita as a result of its commitment to renewable energy the 2016 global green economy index ranked iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world historically icelands economy depended heavily on fishing which still provides 40 of export earnings and employs 7 of the work force the economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports fish and fish products aluminium and ferrosilicon whaling in iceland has been historically significant iceland still relies heavily on fishing but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90 in the 1960s to 40 in 2006 until the 20th century iceland was among the poorest countries in europe currently it remains one of the most developed countries in the world strong economic growth had led iceland to be ranked first in the united nations human development index report for 20072008 although in 2011 its hdi rating had fallen to 14th place as a result of the economic crisis nevertheless according to the economist intelligence index of 2011 iceland has the 2nd highest quality of life in the world based on the gini coefficient iceland also has one of the lowest rates of income inequality in the world and when adjusted for inequality its hdi ranking is 6th icelands unemployment rate has declined consistently since the crisis with 48 of the labour force being unemployed as of june2012 compared to 6 in 2011 and 81 in 2010 many political parties remain opposed to eu membership primarily due to icelanders concern about losing control over their natural resources particularly fisheries the national currency of iceland is the icelandic krna isk iceland is the only country in the world to have a population under two million yet still have a floating exchange rate and an independent monetary policy a poll released on 5 march 2010 by capacent gallup showed that 31 of respondents were in favour

emit 629tonnes of co2 in 2009 equivalent of greenhouse gases per capita iceland is one of the few countries that have filling stations dispensing hydrogen fuel for cars powered by fuel cells it is also one of a few countries currently capable of producing hydrogen in adequate quantities at a reasonable cost because of icelands plentiful renewable sources of energy on 22 january 2009 iceland announced its first round of offshore licences for companies wanting to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and production in a region northeast of iceland known as the dreki area two exploration licenses have been awarded in 2010 iceland was noted by guinness world records as the greenest country reaching the highest score by the environmental sustainability index which measures a countrys water use biodiversity and adoption of clean energies with a score of 935100 as of 2012 the government of iceland was in talks with the government of the united kingdom about the possibility of constructing a high-voltage direct-current connector for transmission of electricity between the two countries such a cable would give iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in iceland iceland has considerable renewable energy resources especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources and most of the potential has not been developed partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of iceland the united kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy and this could lead to further development of the energy resources education and science the ministry of education science and culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use and they issue the national curriculum guidelines however playschools primary schools and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities the government does allow citizens to home educate their children however under a very strict set of demands students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate nursery school or leikskli is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years and is the first step in the education system the current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994 they are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible compulsory education or grunnskli comprises primary and lower secondary education which often is conducted at the same institution education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16years the school year lasts nine months beginning between 21 august and 1 september ending between 31 may and 10 june the minimum number of school days was once 170 but after a new teachers wage contract it

34-year-olds only 69 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree significantly lower than the oecd average of 80 nevertheless icelands education system is considered excellent the programme for international student assessment currently ranks it as the 16th best performing above the oecd average students were particularly proficient in reading and mathematics according to a 2013 eurostat report by the european commission iceland spends around 311 of its gdp on scientific research and development rd over 1 percentage point higher than the eu average of 203 and has set a target of 4 to reach by 2020 a 2010 unesco report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on rd 100million us dollars or more iceland ranked 9th by proportion of gdp tied with taiwan switzerland and germany and ahead of france the uk and canada demographics the original population of iceland was of nordic and gaelic origin this is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses one such genetic study indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of nordic origin while the majority of the women were of gaelic origin meaning many settlers of iceland were norsemen who brought gaelic slaves with them iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the age of settlement the biopharmaceutical company decode genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database that is intended to cover all of icelands known inhabitants it views the database called slendingabk as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases given the relative isolation of icelands population the population of the island is believed to have varied from 40000 to 60000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century during that time cold winters ash fall from volcanic eruptions and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times there were 37 famine years in iceland between 1500 and 1804 the first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50358 after the destructive volcanic eruptions of the laki volcano during 17831784 the population reached a low of about 40000 improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th centuryfrom about 60000 in 1850 to 320000 in 2008 iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country with one out of five people being 14years old or younger with a fertility rate of 21 iceland is one of only a few european countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth see table below in december 2007 33678 people 135 of the total population living in iceland had been born abroad including children of icelandic parents living abroad around 19000 people 6 of the population held foreign citizenship polish people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce about 8000 poles now live in iceland 1500 of them in fjarabygg where they make up 75 of the workforce who are constructing the fjararl aluminium plant large-scale construction projects in the east of iceland see krahnjkar hydropower plant have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary many polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the icelandic financial crisis the southwest corner of iceland is the most densely populated region it is also the location of the capital reykjavk the northernmost national capital in the world the largest towns outside the greater reykjavk area are akureyri and reykjanesbr although the latter is relatively close to the capital some 500 icelanders under the leadership of erik the red settled greenland in the late 10th century the total population reached a high point of perhaps 5000 and developed independent institutions before disappearing by 1500 people from greenland attempted to set up a settlement at vinland in north america but abandoned it in the face of hostility from the indigenous residents emigration of icelanders to the united states and canada began in the 1870s as of 2006 canada had over 88000 people of icelandic descent while there are more than 40000 americans of icelandic descent according to the 2000 us census urbanisation icelands 10 most populous urban areas language icelands official written and spoken language is icelandic a north germanic language descended from old norse in grammar and vocabulary it has changed less from old norse than the other nordic languages icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages the puristic tendency in the development of icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning in addition to centuries of isolation icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter in latin script the closest living relative of the icelandic language is faroese icelandic sign language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011 in education its use for icelands deaf community is regulated by the national curriculum guide english and danish are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum english is widely understood and spoken while basic to moderate knowledge of danish is common mainly among the older generations polish is mostly spoken by the local polish community the largest minority of iceland and danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to swedes and norwegiansit is often referred to as skandinavska i e scandinavian in iceland rather than using family names as is the usual custom in most western nations icelanders carry patronymic or matronymic surnames patronyms being far more commonly practiced patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother these follow the persons given name eg elsabet jnsdttir elsabet jns daughter jn being the father or lafur katrnarson lafur katrns son katrn being the mother consequently icelanders refer to one another by their given name and the icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname all new names must be approved by the icelandic naming committee health iceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its ministry of welfare icelandic velferarruneyti and paid for mostly by taxes 85 and to a lesser extent by service fees 15 unlike most countries there are no private hospitals and private insurance is practically nonexistent a considerable portion of the government budget is assigned to health care and iceland ranks 11th in health care expenditures as a percentage of gdp and 14th in spending per capita overall the countrys health care system is one of the best performing in the world ranked 15th by the world health organization according to an oecd report iceland devotes far more resources to healthcare than most industrialised nations as of 2009 iceland had 37 doctors per 1000 people compared with an average of 31 in oecd countries and 153 nurses per 1000 people compared with an oecd average of 84 icelanders are among the worlds healthiest people with 81 reporting they are in good health according to an oecd survey although it is a growing problem

champion magnus scheving infant mortality is one of the lowest in the world and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the oecd average almost all women choose to terminate pregnancies of children with down syndrome in iceland the average life expectancy is 818 compared to an oecd average of 795 the 4th highest in the world iceland has a very low level of pollution thanks to an overwhelming reliance on cleaner geothermal energy a low population density and a high level of environmental consciousness among citizens according to an oecd assessment the amount of toxic materials in the atmosphere is far lower than in any other industrialised country measured religion icelanders have freedom of religion guaranteed under the constitution although the church of iceland a lutheran body is the state church the evangelical lutheran church shall be the state church in iceland and as such it shall be supported and protected by the state the registers iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every icelandic citizen in 2017 icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows 6722 members of the church of iceland 1156 members of other christian denomination 1129 other religions and not specified 669 unaffiliated 119 members of germanic heathen groups 99 of them belonging to satrarflagi 067 members of the icelandic ethical humanist association 055 members of zuist groups iceland is a very secular country as with other nordic nations church attendance is relatively low the above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population according to a study published in 2001 23 of the inhabitants were either atheist or agnostic a gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57 of icelanders considered themselves religious 31 considered themselves non-religious while 10 defined themselves as convinced atheists placing iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world icelanders registered in the state church the church of iceland is declining rapidly at a rate of more than 1 per year culture icelandic culture has its roots in north germanic traditions icelandic literature is popular in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the high and late middle ages centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the countrys nordic culture from external influence a prominent example is the preservation of the icelandic language which remains the closest to old norse of all modern nordic languages in contrast to other nordic countries icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency in a public opinion analysis conducted by the european commission over 85 of icelanders believe independence is very important compared to 47 of norwegians 49 of danes and an average of 53 for the eu25 icelanders also have a very strong work ethic working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation according to a poll conducted by the oecd 66 of icelanders were satisfied with their lives while 70 believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future similarly 83 reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones compared to an oecd average of 72 which makes iceland one of the happiest countries in the oecd a more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives compared to a global average of about 53 iceland is liberal with regard to lgbt rights issues in 1996 the icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for same-sex couples conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage in 2006 parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption parenting and assisted insemination treatment on 11 june 2010 the icelandic parliament amended the marriage law making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals making iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise same-sex marriages the law took effect on 27 june 2010 the amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible and marriage is their only optionidentical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples icelanders are known for their deep sense of community an oecd survey found that 98 believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need higher than in any other industrialised country similarly only 6 reported rarely or never socialising with others this high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation egalitarianism is highly valued among the people of iceland with income inequality being among the lowest in the world the constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges titles and ranks everyone is addressed by their first name as in other nordic countries equality between the sexes is very high iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in literature in 2011 reykjavik was designated a unesco

famously the passion hymns of hallgrmur ptursson and rmur rhyming epic poems originating in the 14th century rmur were popular into the 19th century when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential national-romantic writer jnas hallgrmsson in recent times iceland has produced many great writers the best-known of whom is arguably halldr laxness who received the nobel prize in literature in 1955 the only icelander to win a nobel prize thus far steinn steinarr was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular icelanders are avid consumers of literature with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world for its size iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation iceland also has

this time period is known as jolabokaflod the christmas book flood the flood begins with the iceland publishers association distributing bokatidindi a catalog of all new publications free to each icelandic home art the distinctive rendition of the icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence which was very active in the mid-19th century contemporary icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of rarinn orlksson who following formal training in art in the 1890s in copenhagen returned to iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924 almost exclusively portraying the icelandic landscape several other icelandic men and women artists studied at royal danish academy of fine arts at that time including sgrmur jnsson who together with rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of icelands landscape in a romantic naturalistic style other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of rarinn and sgrmur these included jhannes kjarval and jlana sveinsdttir kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the icelandic environment einar hkonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into icelandic painting in the 1980s many icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work in the recent years artistic practice has multiplied and the icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions the artist run gallery space kling og bang members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue klink og bank has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces exhibitions and projects the living art museum reykjavk municipal art museum reykjavk art museum and the national gallery of iceland are
