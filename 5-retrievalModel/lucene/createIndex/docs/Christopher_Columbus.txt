christopher columbus klmbs before 31 october 1451 20 may 1506 was an italian explorer navigator and colonist who completed four voyages across the atlantic ocean under the auspices of the catholic monarchs of spain he led the first european expeditions to the caribbean central america and south america initiating the permanent european colonization of the americas columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the americas a continent which was not then known to the old world while what he thought he had discovered was a route to the far east he is credited with the opening of the americas for conquest and settlement by europeans columbuss early life is somewhat obscure but scholars generally agree that he was born in the republic of genoa and spoke a dialect of ligurian as his first language he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely as far north as the british isles and possibly iceland and as far south as what is now ghana he married a portuguese woman and was based in lisbon for several years but later took a spanish mistress he had one son with each woman though largely self-educated columbus was widely read in geography astronomy and history he formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the east indies hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade after years of lobbying the catholic monarchs of spain agreed to sponsor a journey west in the name of the crown of castile columbus left spain in august 1492 with three ships and after a stopover in the canary islands made landfall in the americas on 12 october now celebrated as columbus day his landing place was an island in the bahamas known by its native inhabitants as guanahani its exact location is uncertain columbus subsequently visited cuba and hispaniola establishing a colony in what is now haitithe first european settlement in the americas since the norse colonies almost 500 years earlier he arrived back in spain in early 1493 bringing a number of captive natives with him word of his discoveries soon spread throughout europe columbus would make three further voyages to the new world exploring the lesser antilles in 1493 trinidad and the northern coast of south america in 1498 and the eastern coast of central america in 1502 many of the names he gave to geographical featuresparticularly islandsare still in use he continued to seek a passage to the east indies and the extent to which he was aware that the americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain he gave the name indios indians to the indigenous peoples he encountered columbuss strained relationship with the spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in america led to his arrest and removal from hispaniola in 1500 and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown columbuss expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration conquest and colonization that lasted for centuries helping create the modern western world the transfers between the old world and new world that followed his first voyage are known as the columbian exchange and the period of human habitation in the americas prior to his arrival is known as the pre-columbian era columbuss legacy continues to be debated he was widely venerated in the centuries after his death but public perceptions have changed as recent scholars have given attention to negative aspects of his life such as his role in the extinction of the tano people his promotion of slavery and allegations of tyranny towards spanish colonists many landmarks and institutions in the western hemisphere bear his name including the country of colombia early life the name christopher columbus is the anglicisation of the latin christophorus columbus his name in ligurian is cristffa cmbo in italian cristoforo colombo and in spanish cristbal coln he was born before 31 october 1451 in the territory of the republic of genoa now part of modern italy though the exact location remains disputed his father was domenico colombo a middle-class wool weaver who worked both in genoa and savona and who also owned a cheese stand at which young christopher worked as a helper his mother was susanna fontanarossa bartolomeo giovanni pellegrino and giacomo were his brothers bartolomeo worked in a cartography workshop in lisbon for at least part of his adulthood he also had a sister named bianchinetta columbus never wrote in his native language which is presumed to have been a genoese variety of ligurian his name would translate in the 16th-century genoese language as christoffa corombo ligurian pronunciationkritffa kuubu in one of his writings he says he went to sea at the age of 10 in 1470 the columbus family moved to savona where domenico took over a tavern in the same year christopher was on a genoese ship hired in the service of ren of anjou to support his attempt to conquer the kingdom of naples some modern historians have argued that he was not from genoa but instead from the aragon region of spain or from portugal these competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars in 1473 columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important centurione di negro and spinola families of genoa later he allegedly made a trip to chios an aegean island then ruled by genoa in may 1476 he took part in an armed convoy sent by genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern europe he docked in bristol england and galway ireland in 1477 he was possibly in iceland in the autumn of 1477 he sailed on a portuguese ship from galway to lisbon where he found his brother bartolomeo and they continued trading for the centurione family columbus based himself in lisbon from 1477 to 1485 he married filipa moniz perestrelo daughter of the porto santo governor and portuguese nobleman of lombard origin bartolomeu perestrello in 1479 or 1480 his son diego columbus was born between 1482 and 1485 columbus traded along the coasts of west africa reaching the portuguese trading post of elmina at the guinea coast in present-day ghana some records report that filipa died sometime around 1485 while columbus was away in castile he returned to portugal to settle her estate and take his son diego with him he had left portugal for castile in 1485 where he found a mistress in 1487 a 20-year-old orphan named beatriz enrquez de arana it is likely that beatriz met columbus when he was in crdoba a gathering site of many genoese merchants and where the court of the catholic monarchs was located at intervals beatriz unmarried at the time gave birth to columbuss natural son fernando columbus in july 1488 named for the monarch of aragn columbus recognized the boy as his offspring columbus entrusted his older legitimate son diego to take care of beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death but diego was negligent in his duties ambitious columbus eventually learned latin portuguese and castilian he read widely about astronomy geography and history including the works of claudius ptolemy cardinal pierre daillys imago mundi the travels of marco polo and sir john mandeville plinys natural history and pope pius iis historia rerum ubique gestarum according to historian edmund morgan columbus was not a scholarly man yet he studied these books made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong throughout his life columbus also showed a keen interest in the bible and in biblical prophecies often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs for example part of the argument that he submitted to the spanish catholic monarchs when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the second book of esdras ezra see 2 esdras 642 which he took to mean that the earth is made of six parts of land to one of water towards the end of his life he produced a book of prophecies in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of christian eschatology and of apocalypticism quest for asia background under the mongol empires hegemony over asia the pax mongolica or mongol peace europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage the silk road to the indies then construed roughly as all of south and east asia and china which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk with the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks in 1453 the land route to asia became much more difficult and dangerous portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to asia in 1470 the florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli suggested to king afonso v of portugal that sailing west would be a quicker way to reach the spice islands cathay and cipangu than the route around africa afonso rejected his proposal portuguese explorers under the leadership of king john ii then developed the cape route to asia around africa major progress in this quest was achieved in 1488 when bartolomeu dias reached the cape of good hope in what is now south africa meanwhile in the 1480s the columbus brothers had picked up toscanellis suggestion and proposed a plan to reach the indies by sailing west across the ocean sea ie the atlantic however diass discovery had shifted the interests of portuguese seafaring to the southeast passage which complicated columbuss proposals significantly geographical considerations washington irvings 1828 biography of columbus popularized the idea that columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many catholic theologians insisted that the earth was flat in fact nearly all educated westerners had understood at least since the time of aristotle that the earth is spherical the sphericity of the earth is also accounted for in the work of ptolemy on which medieval astronomy was largely based christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the earth is spherical include saint bede the venerable in his reckoning of time written around ad 723 in columbuss time the techniques of celestial navigation which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky together with the understanding that the earth is a sphere had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners as far back as the 3rd century bc eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations in the 1st century bc posidonius confirmed eratostheness results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations these measurements were widely known among scholars but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the earth from daillys imago mundi columbus learned of alfraganuss estimate that a degree of latitude or a degree of longitude along the equator spanned 5623 miles but did not realize that this was expressed in the arabic mile rather than the shorter roman mile with which he was familiar 1480m he therefore estimated the circumference of the earth to be about 30200km whereas the correct value is 40000km 25000mi furthermore most scholars accepted ptolemys estimate that eurasia spanned 180 longitude rather than the actual 130 to the chinese mainland or 150 to japan at the latitude of spain columbus for his part believed the even higher estimate of marinus of tyre which put the longitudinal span of the eurasian landmass at 225 leaving only 135 of water he also believed that japan which he called cipangu following marco polo was much larger farther to the east from china cathay and closer to the equator than it is and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than japan including the mythical antillia which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the azores in this he was influenced by the ideas of florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli who corresponded with columbus in 1474 and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to asia columbus therefore estimated the distance from the canary islands to japan to be about 3000 italian miles 3700km or 2300 statute miles the true figure is now known to be vastly larger about 20000km no ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable most european navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from europe to asia was unfeasible the catholic monarchs however having completed an expensive war in the iberian peninsula were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other european countries in the quest for trade with the indies columbuss project though far-fetched held the promise of such an advantage nautical considerations though columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated europe from the far east and about the distance that each degree represented he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the atlantic ocean during his first voyage in 1492 the brisk trade winds from the east commonly called easterlies propelled columbuss fleet for five weeks from the canary islands to the bahamas the precise first land sighting and landing point was san salvador island to return to spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique called beating during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted instead columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the north atlantic where he was able to catch the westerlies that blow eastward to the coast of western europe there in turn the winds curve southward towards the iberian peninsula it is unclear whether columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others the corresponding technique for efficient travel in the atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the portuguese who referred to it as the volta do mar turn of the sea columbuss knowledge of the atlantic wind patterns was however imperfect at the time of his first voyage by sailing directly due west from the canary islands during hurricane season skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-atlantic columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone both of which by chance he avoided quest for financial support for a voyage in 1485 columbus presented his plans to king john ii of portugal he proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant columbus one years time to sail out into the atlantic search for a western route to the orient and return columbus also requested he be made great admiral of the ocean appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands the king submitted columbuss proposal to his experts who rejected it it was their considered opinion that columbuss estimation of a travel distance of 2400 miles 3860km was in fact far too low in 1488 columbus again appealed to the court of portugal resulting in john ii again inviting him for an audience that meeting also proved unsuccessful in part because not long afterwards bartolomeu dias returned to portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of africa near the cape of good hope with an eastern sea route to asia apparently at hand king john was no longer interested in columbuss far-fetched project columbus traveled from portugal to both genoa and venice but he received encouragement from neither he had also dispatched his brother bartholomew to the court of henry vii of england to inquire whether the english crown might sponsor his expedition but also without success columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile who had united several kingdoms in the iberian peninsula by marrying and were ruling together on 1 may 1486 permission having been granted columbus presented his plans to queen isabella who in turn referred it to a committee after the passing of much time the savants of spain like their counterparts in portugal replied that columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to asia they pronounced the idea impractical and advised their royal highnesses to pass on the proposed venture however to keep columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere and perhaps to keep their options open the catholic monarchs gave him an annual allowance of 12000 maravedis and in 1489 furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost agreement with the spanish crown after continually lobbying at the spanish court and two years of negotiations he finally had success in january 1492 ferdinand and isabella had just conquered granada the last muslim stronghold on the iberian peninsula and they received columbus in crdoba in the alczar castle isabella turned him down on the advice of her confessor columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when ferdinand intervened isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and ferdinand later claimed credit for being the principal cause why those islands were discovered in the april 1492 capitulations of santa fe king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain he had the right to nominate three persons from whom the sovereigns would choose one for any office in the new lands he would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity additionally he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts he and his sons diego and fernando then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the castilian crown known as the pleitos colombinos alleging that the crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to columbus and his heirs the columbus family had some success in their first litigation as a judgment of 1511 confirmed diegos position as viceroy but reduced his powers diego resumed litigation in 1512 which lasted until 1536 and further disputes continued until 1790 voyages between 1492 and 1503 columbus completed four round-trip voyages between spain and the americas each voyage being sponsored by the crown of castile on his first voyage he independently discovered the americas and magnetic declination these voyages marked the beginning of the european exploration and colonization of the american continents and are thus of enormous significance in western history columbus always insisted in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the asian continent as previously described by marco polo and other european travelers columbuss refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for spain were not part of asia might explain in part why the american continent was named after the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci and not after columbus first voyage on the evening of 3 august 1492 columbus departed from palos de la frontera with three ships the largest was a carrack spanish nao the santa mara ex-gallega galician the other two were smaller caravels the name of one is lost it is known today only by the nickname pinta which in castilian of the time meant painted one the santa clara was nicknamed affectionately the nia the little one a pun on the name of her owner juan nio of moguer the monarchs forced the citizens of palos to contribute to the expedition the santa mara was owned by juan de la cosa and captained by columbus the pinta and the nia were piloted by the pinzn brothers martn alonso and vicente yez columbus first sailed to the canary islands which belonged to castile he restocked provisions and made repairs in gran canaria then departed from san sebastin de la gomera on 6 september for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean at about 200 in the morning of 12 october 21 october gregorian calendar new style a lookout on the pinta rodrigo de triana also known as juan rodrguez bermeo spotted land and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout thereupon the captain of the pinta martn alonso pinzn verified the discovery and alerted columbus by firing a lombard columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by ferdinand and isabella to the first person to sight land columbus called the island in what is now the bahamas san salvador meaning holy savior the natives called it guanahani exactly which island in the bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved based on primary accounts and on what one would expect from the geographic positions of the islands given columbuss course the prime candidates are san salvador island so named in 1925 on the theory that it was columbuss san salvador samana cay and plana cays the indigenous people he encountered the lucayan tano and arawak were peaceful and friendly he called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited indios spanish for indians noting their gold ear ornaments columbus took some of the arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold from the entry in his journal of 12 october 1492 in which he wrote of them many of the men i have seen have scars on their bodies and when i made signs to them to find out how this happened they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to san salvador to capture them they defend themselves the best they can i believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves they ought to make good and skilled servants for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them i think they can very easily be made christians for they seem to have no religion if it pleases our lord i will take six of them to your highnesses when i depart in order that they may learn our language columbus noted that their primitive weapons and military tactics made them susceptible to easy conquest writing these people are very simple in war-like matters i could conquer the whole of them with 50 men and govern them as i pleased columbus also explored the northeast coast of cuba where he landed on 28 october on 22 november martn alonso pinzn took the pinta on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called babeque or baneque which the natives had told him was rich in gold columbus for his part continued to the northern coast of hispaniola where he landed on 5 december there the santa mara ran aground on christmas day 1492 and had to be abandoned the wreck was used as a target for cannon fire to impress the native peoples columbus was received by the native cacique guacanagari who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind columbus left 39 men including luis de torres the converso interpreter who spoke hebrew and arabic and founded the settlement of la navidad at the site of present-day bord de mer de limonade haiti columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration he kept sailing along the northern coast of hispaniola with a single ship until he encountered pinzn and the pinta on 6 january on 13 january 1493 columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the new world in the bay of rincn at the eastern end of the saman peninsula in northeast hispaniola there he encountered the warlike cigayos the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the americas the cigayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that columbus desired in the ensuing clash one ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest because of this and because of the cigayos use of arrows he called the inlet where he met them the bay of arrows or gulf of arrows columbus kidnapped about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him only seven or eight of the natives arrived in spain alive columbus headed for spain on the nia but a storm separated him from the pinta and forced the nia to stop at the island of santa maria in the azores half of his crew went ashore to say prayers in a chapel to give thanks for having survived the storm but while praying they were imprisoned by the governor of the island ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates after a two-day standoff the prisoners were released and columbus again set sail for spain another storm forced him into the port at lisbon he anchored next to the kings harbor patrol ship on 4 march 1493 in portugal there he was interviewed by bartolomeu dias who had rounded the cape of good hope a few years earlier in 14881489 diass success had complicated columbuss attempts to secure funding from the portuguese court because the sure route to the indies that dias pioneered made a risky conjectural western route unnecessary not finding king john ii of portugal in lisbon columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for johns reply john asked columbus to go to vale do paraso north of lisbon to meet him relations between portugal and castile were poor at the time columbus went to meet with john at vale do paraso hearing of columbuss discoveries john told him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 treaty of alcovas after spending more than a week in portugal and paying his respects to eleanor of viseu columbus again set sail for spain ferdinand magellan was a young boy and a ward of eleanors court it is likely he saw columbus during this visit after departing and after reportedly being saved from assassins by king john columbus crossed the bar of saltes and entered the harbor of palos de la frontera on 15 march 1493 word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout europe second voyage columbus left the port of cdiz on 24 september 1493 with a fleet of 17 ships carrying 1200 men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the new world the passengers included priests farmers and soldiers who would be the new colonists this reflected the new policy of creating not just colonies of exploitation but also colonies of settlement from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to christianity modern studies suggest that as reported by the washington post crew members may have included free black africans who arrived in the new world about a decade before the slave trade began as in the first voyage the fleet stopped at the canary islands from which it departed on 13 october following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition on 3 november columbus sighted a rugged island that he named dominica latin for sunday later that day he landed at marie-galante which he named santa mara la galante after sailing past les saintes los santos the saints he arrived at the island of guadeloupe which he named santa mara de guadalupe de extremadura after the image of the virgin mary venerated at the spanish monastery of villuercas in guadalupe cceres spain he explored that island from 4 to 10 november michele da cuneo columbuss childhood friend from savona sailed with columbus during the second voyage and wrote in my opinion since genoa was genoa there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord admiral columbus named the small island of saona to honor michele da cuneo his friend from savona the same childhood friend reported in a letter that columbus had provided one of the captured indigenous women to him he wrote while i was in the boat i captured a very beautiful carib woman whom the said lord admiral gave to me when i had taken her to my cabin she was nakedas was their custom i was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire she was unwilling and so treated me with her nails that i wished i had never begun butto cut a long story shorti then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears eventually we came to such terms i assure you that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores pedro de las casas father of the priest bartolom de las casas also accompanied columbus on this voyage the exact course of columbuss voyage through the lesser antilles is debated but it seems likely that he turned north sighting and naming several islands including montserrat for santa mara de montserrate after the blessed virgin of the monastery of montserrat which is located on the mountain of montserrat in catalonia spain antigua after a church in seville spain called santa mara la antigua meaning old st marys redonda santa mara la redonda spanish for st mary the round owing to the islands shape nevis derived from the spanish nuestra seora de las nieves our lady of the snows because columbus thought the clouds over nevis peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain saint kitts for st christopher patron of sailors and travelers sint eustatius for the early roman martyr st eustachius saba after the biblical queen of sheba saint martin san martn and saint croix from the spanish santa cruz meaning holy cross columbus also sighted the chain of the virgin islands which he named islas de santa rsula y las once mil vrgenes islands of saint ursula and the 11000 virgins shortened both on maps of the time and in common parlance to islas vrgenes he also named the islands of virgin gorda fat virgin tortola and peter island san pedro one of the first skirmishes between native americans and europeans since the time of the vikings occurred on 14 november when at saint croix columbuss men rescued two native boys from several cannibalistic island caribs columbuss men pursued the carib canoe which met them with arrows several europeans were wounded but they killed all of the caribs and learned that the two boys had recently been castrated by their captors columbus continued to the virgin islands and landed in puerto rico which he named san juan bautista in honor of saint john the baptist a name that was later given to the capital city of san juan on 22 november columbus returned to hispaniola where he intended to visit the fort of la navidad built during his first voyage and located on the northern coast of haiti columbus found the fort in ruins destroyed by the native taino people among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the 39 spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the new world columbus then sailed more than 100 kilometres 62 miles eastwards along the northern coast of hispaniola establishing a new settlement which he called la isabela in the present-day dominican republic however la isabela proved to be poorly located and the settlement was short-lived third voyage according to the abstract of columbuss journal made by bartolom de las casas the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that king john ii of portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the cape verde islands king john reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because canoes had been found which set out from the coast of guinea west africa and sailed to the west with merchandise on 30 may 1498 columbus left with six ships from sanlcar spain for his third trip to the new world three of the ships headed directly for hispaniola with much-needed supplies while columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the caribbean islands he had already visited including a hoped-for passage to continental asia columbus led his fleet to the portuguese island of porto santo his wifes native land he then sailed to madeira and spent some time there with the portuguese captain joo gonalves da camara before sailing to the canary islands and cape verde as he crossed the atlantic columbus discovered that the angle between north as indicated by a magnetic compass and north as measured by the position of the pole star changed with his position a phenomenon now known as compass variation he would later use his previous measurements of the compass variation to adjust his reckoning after being becalmed for several days in the doldrums of the mid-atlantic columbuss fleet regained its wind and dangerously low on water turned north in the direction of dominica which columbus had visited in his previous voyage the ships arrived at king johns hypothesized continent which is south america when they sighted the land of trinidad on 31 july approaching from the southeast the fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered dragons mouth anchoring near soldado rock where they made contact with a group of native amerindians in canoes columbus then landed on trinidad at icacos point which he named punta de arenal on 2 august after resupplying with food and water from 4 to 12 august columbus explored the gulf of paria which separates trinidad from what is now venezuela near the delta of the orinoco river he then touched the mainland of south america at the paria peninsula exploring the new continent columbus correctly interpreted the enormous quantity of fresh water that the orinoco delivered into the atlantic ocean as evidence that he had reached a large landmass rather than another island he also speculated that the new continent might be the location of the biblical garden of eden he then sailed to the islands of chacachacare and margarita he sighted tobago which he named bella forma and grenada which he named concepcin in poor health columbus returned to hispaniola on 19 august only to find that many of the spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule claiming that columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world a number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against columbus at the spanish court accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience he had an economic interest in the enslavement of the hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them which attracted criticism from some churchmen an entry in his journal from september 1498 reads from here one might send in the name of the holy trinity as many slaves as could be sold columbus was eventually forced to make peace with the rebellious colonists on humiliating terms in 1500 the crown had him removed as governor arrested and transported in chains to spain see accusations of tyranny section below he was eventually freed and allowed to return to the new world but not as governor fourth voyage before leaving for his fourth voyage columbus wrote a letter to the governors of the bank of saint george genoa dated at seville 2 april 1502 he wrote although my body is here my heart is always near you columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the strait of malacca to the indian ocean accompanied by his brother bartolomeo and his 13-year-old son fernando he left cdiz on 11 may 1502 with his flagship santa mara and the vessels gallega vizcana and santiago de palos he sailed to arzila on the moroccan coast to rescue portuguese soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the moors on 15 june they landed at carbet on the island of martinique martinica a hurricane was brewing so he continued on hoping to find shelter on hispaniola he arrived at santo domingo on 29 june but was denied port and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction instead while columbuss ships sheltered at the mouth of the rio jaina the first spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane columbuss ships survived with only minor damage while 29 of the 30 ships in the governors fleet were lost to a storm on 1 july in addition to the ships 500 lives including that of the governor francisco de bobadilla and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea after a brief stop at jamaica columbus sailed to central america arriving at guanaja isla de pinos in the bay islands off the coast of honduras on 30 july here bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe which was described as being long as a galley and filled with cargo on 14 august he landed on the continental mainland at puerto castilla near trujillo honduras he spent two months exploring the coasts of honduras nicaragua and costa rica before arriving in almirante bay in panama on 16 october on 5 december 1502 columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced in his journal columbus writes for nine days i was as one lost without hope of life eyes never beheld the sea so angry so high so covered with foam the wind not only prevented our progress but offered no opportunity to run behind any headland for shelter hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody ocean seething like a pot on a hot fire never did the sky look more terrible for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace and the lightning broke with such violence that each time i wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted all this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky i do not say it rained for it was like another deluge the men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering in panama columbus learned from the ngobe of gold and a strait to another ocean but was told by local leader quiban not to go past a certain point down the river after much exploration in january 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the beln river on 6 april one of the ships became stranded in the river at the same time the garrison was attacked by quiban and the other ships were damaged shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters columbus left for hispaniola on 16 april heading north on 10 may he sighted the cayman islands naming them las tortugas after the numerous sea turtles there his ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of cuba unable to travel farther on 25 june 1503 they were beached in stanns bay jamaica for one year columbus and his men remained stranded on jamaica a spaniard diego mndez and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from hispaniola the governor nicols de ovando y cceres detested columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men in the meantime columbus in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men won their favor by predicting a lunar eclipse for 29 february 1504 using abraham zacutos astronomical charts help finally arrived no thanks to the governor on 29 june 1504 and columbus and his men arrived in sanlcar spain on 7 november accusations of tyranny following his first voyage columbus was appointed viceroy and governor of the indies under the terms of the capitulations of santa fe in practice this primarily entailed the administration of the colonies in the island of hispaniola whose capital was established in santo domingo by the end of his third voyage columbus was physically and mentally exhausted his body wracked by arthritis and his eyes by ophthalmia in october 1499 he sent two ships to spain asking the court of spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern by this time accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of columbus had also reached the court queen isabella and king ferdinand responded by removing columbus from power and replacing him with francisco de bobadilla a member of the order of calatrava bobadilla who ruled as governor from 1500 until his death in a storm in 1502 had also been tasked by the court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against columbus arriving in santo domingo while columbus was away in the explorations of his third voyage bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three columbus brothers christopher bartolomeo and diego bobadilla reported to spain that columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern hispaniola the 48-page report found in 2006 in the national archive in the spanish city of simancas contains testimonies from 23 people including both enemies and supporters of columbus about the treatment of colonial subjects by columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule according to the report columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery testimony recorded in the report stated that columbus congratulated his brother bartolomeo on defending the family when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that columbus was of lowly birth the document also describes how columbus put down native unrest and revolt he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion columbuss government was characterised by a form of tyranny consuelo varela a spanish historian who has seen the document told journalists even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place because of their gross misgovernance columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to spain from the third voyage they lingered in jail for six weeks before king ferdinand ordered their release not long after the king and queen summoned the columbus brothers to the alhambra palace in granada there the royal couple heard the brothers pleas restored their freedom and wealth and after much persuasion agreed to fund columbuss fourth voyage but the door was firmly shut on columbuss role as governor henceforth nicols de ovando y cceres was to be the new governor of the west indies later life columbus had always claimed the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations but he grew increasingly religious in his later years probably with the assistance of his son diego and his friend the carthusian monk gaspar gorricio columbus produced two books during his later years a book of privileges 1502 detailing and documenting the rewards from the spanish crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled and a book of prophecies 1505 in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of bible prophecy in the context of christian eschatology in his later years columbus demanded that the spanish crown give him 10 percent of all profits made in the new lands as stipulated in the capitulations of santa fe because he had been relieved of his duties as governor the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected after his death his heirs sued the crown for a part of the profits from trade with america as well as other rewards this led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the pleitos colombinos columbian lawsuits illness and death during a violent storm on his first return voyage columbus then 41 suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be gout in subsequent years he was plagued with what was thought to be influenza and other fevers bleeding from the eyes and prolonged attacks of gout the suspected attacks increased in duration and severity sometimes leaving columbus bedridden for months at a time and culminated in his death 14 years later based on columbuss lifestyle and the described symptoms modern doctors suspect that he suffered from reactive arthritis rather than gout reactive arthritis previously known as reiters syndrome is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases primarily chlamydia or gonorrhea it seems likely that columbus acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation writes dr frank c arnett a rheumatologist and professor of internal medicine pathology and laboratory medicine the university of texas medical school at houston on 20 may 1506 aged probably 54 columbus died in valladolid spain his remains were first interred at valladolid then at the monastery of la cartuja in seville southern spain by the will of his son diego coln who had been governor of hispaniola in 1542 the remains were transferred to colonial santo domingo in the present-day dominican republic in 1795 when france took over the entire island of hispaniola columbuss remains were moved to havana cuba after cuba became independent following the spanishamerican war in 1898 the remains were moved back to spain to the cathedral of seville where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque however a lead box bearing an inscription identifying don christopher columbus and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at santo domingo in 1877 to lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to havana and that columbuss remains had been left buried in the cathedral at santo domingo dna samples of the corpse resting in seville were taken in june 2003 history today august 2003 as well as other dna samples from the remains of his brother diego and younger son fernando coln initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with columbus dna extraction proved difficult only short fragments of mitochondrial dna could be isolated the mitochondrial dna fragments matched corresponding dna from columbuss brother giving support that both individuals had shared the same mother such evidence together with anthropologic and historic analyses led the researchers to conclude that the remains found in seville belonged to christopher columbus the authorities in santo domingo have never allowed the remains there to be exhumed so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from columbuss body as well the dominican remains are located in the columbus lighthouse faro a coln in santo domingo commemoration the anniversary of columbuss 1492 landing in the americas is usually observed on 12 october in spain and throughout the americas except canada in spain it is called the fiesta nacional de espaa y da de la hispanidad while a number of countries in latin america celebrate it as da de la raza in the united states it is called columbus day and is observed annually on the second monday in october there are efforts in the us to rename columbus day as indigenous peoples day the world columbian exposition in chicago 1893 commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of christopher columbus in the americas over 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration the united states postal service participated in the celebration issuing the first us commemorative postage stamps a series of 16 postage issues called the columbian issue depicting columbus queen isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages the issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations under benjamin harrison and his postmaster general john wanamaker the columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the world columbian exposition in chicago illinois in 1893 wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nations first commemorative stamp to harrison the congress and the us post office to demonstrate his confidence in the new columbian commemorative issues wanamaker purchased 10000 worth of stamps with his own money the columbian exposition lasted several months and over 40million in commemorative postage stamps had been sold the 400th anniversary columbian issues were very popular in the united states a total of two billion stamps were issued for all the columbian denominations and 72 percent of these were the two-cent stamps landing of columbus which paid the first-class rate for domestic mail at the time in 1992 a second columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the 500th anniversary except for the date in the upper right hand corner of each stamp these issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced the united states issued the series jointly for the first time with three other countries italy in lire portugal in escudos and spain in pesetas legacy columbuss voyages are considered some of the most important events in world history kickstarting modern globalism and resulting in major demographic commercial economic social and political changes these explorations resulted in the permanent contact between the two hemispheres there was a massive exchange of animals plants fungi diseases technologies mineral wealth and ideas exposed to old world diseases the indigenous populations of the new world collapsed and were largely replaced by europeans and africans who brought with them new methods of farming business governance and religious worship spanish is now one the most widely spoken languages in the world spanish is now one the most widely spoken languages in the world

were brought to the new world between 1500 and the mid 19th century large numbers of slaves were brought to the new world between 1500 and the mid 19th century roughly 3915 metric tons of silver was imported by spain from the americas roughly 3915 metric tons of silver was imported by spain from the americas discoverer though christopher columbus came to be considered the discoverer of america in us and european popular culture his historical legacy is more nuanced america was discovered and populated by its indigenous population columbus was not even the first european to reach its shores having been preceded by erik the red in 10th-century greenland and leif erikson in 11th-century vinland at lanse aux meadows however columbuss efforts brought the americas to the attention of europe at a time ripe for europe to act upon thus columbus was able to initiate the enduring association between the earths two major landmasses and their inhabitants columbuss claim to fame isnt that he got there first explains historian martin dugard its that he stayed historians have traditionally argued that columbus remained convinced to the very end that his journeys had been along the east coast of asia but writer kirkpatrick sale argues that a document in the book of privileges indicates columbus knew he found a new continent furthermore his journals from the third voyage call the land of paria a hitherto unknown continent on the other hand his other writings continued to claim that he had reached asia such as a 1502 letter to pope alexander vi where he asserted that cuba was the east coast of asia he also rationalized that the new continent of south america was the earthly paradise that was located at the end of the orient thus it remains unclear what his true beliefs were the term pre-columbian is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the americas before the arrival of columbus and his european successors flat earth mythology columbus is often credited with refuting a prevalent belief in a flat earth however this legacy is a popular misconception to the contrary the spherical shape of the earth had been known to scholars since antiquity and was common knowledge among sailors coincidentally the oldest surviving globe of the earth the erdapfel was made in 1492 just before columbuss return to europe as such it contains no sign of the americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical earth america as a distinct land the scholar amerigo vespucci who sailed to america in the years following columbuss first voyage was the first to speculate that the land was not part of asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to eurasians his travel journals published 150204 convinced german cartographer martin waldseemller to reach the same conclusion and in 1507a year after columbuss deathwaldseemller published a world map calling the new continent america from vespuccis latinized name americus according to paul lunde the preoccupation of european courts with the rise of the ottoman turks in the east partly explains their relative lack of interest in columbuss discoveries in the west historically the english had downplayed columbus and emphasized the role of the venetian john cabot as a pioneer explorer but for the emerging united states cabot made for a poor national hero veneration of columbus in america dates back to colonial times the name columbia for america first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the british parliament the use of columbus as a founding figure of new world nations and the use of the word columbia or simply the name columbus spread rapidly after the american revolution columbuss name was given to the federal capital of the united states district of columbia the capital cities of two us states ohio and south carolina and the columbia river outside the united states the name was used in 1819 for the gran colombia a precursor of the modern republic of colombia numerous cities towns counties streets and plazas called plaza coln or plaza de coln throughout latin america and spain have been named after him a candidate for sainthood in the catholic church in 1866 celebration of columbuss legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the americas monuments to columbus like the columbian exposition in chicago and columbus circle in new york city were erected throughout the united states and latin america extolling him in 1909 descendants of columbus undertook to dismantle the columbus family chapel in spain and move it to boalsburg near state college pennsylvania where it may now be visited by the public at the museum associated with the chapel there are a number of columbus relics worthy of note including the armchair that the admiral of the ocean sea used at his chart table criticism and defense in modern scholarship since the late 20th century historians have criticized columbus for initiating colonization and for abuse of natives among reasons for this criticism is the poor treatment of the native tano people of hispaniola whose population declined rapidly after contact with the spanish columbus required the natives to pay tribute in gold and cotton modern estimates for the pre-columbian population of hispaniola are around 250000300000 according to the historian gonzalo fernandez de oviedo y valdes by 1548 56 years after columbus landed and 42 years after he died fewer than 500 tano were living on the island the indigenous population declined rapidly due primarily to the first pandemic of european endemic diseases which struck hispaniola after 1519 the natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities there is also documentation that they were overworked slavery and serfdom the natives of the island were systematically subjugated via the encomienda system implemented by columbus adapted to the new world from spain it resembled the feudal system in medieval europe as it was based on a lord offering protection to a class of people who owed labor in addition spanish colonists under his rule began to buy and sell natives as slaves including children when natives on hispaniola began fighting back against their oppressors in 1495 columbuss men captured 1500 arawak men women and children in a single raid the strongest were transported to spain to be sold as slaves 40 percent of the 500 shipped died en route historian james w loewen asserts that columbus not only sent the first slaves across the atlantic he probably sent more slavesabout five thousandthan any other individual according to spanish colonist and dominican friar bartolom de las casass contemporary a short account of the destruction of the indies when slaves held in captivity began to die at high rates columbus ordered all natives over the age of thirteen to pay a hawks bell full of gold powder every three months natives who brought this amount to the spanish were given a copper token to hang around their necks the spanish cut off the hands of those without tokens and left them to bleed to death thousands of natives committed suicide by poison to escape their persecution violence towards natives and spanish colonists during his brief reign columbus was reported to have executed spanish colonists for minor crimes as well as use dismemberment as another form of punishment columbuss soldiers killed and enslaved with impunity at every landing when columbus fell ill in 1495 what little restraint he had maintained over his men disappeared as he went through a lengthy period of recuperation the troops went wild stealing killing raping and torturing natives trying to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of gold according to las casas 50000 natives perished during this period upon his recovery columbus organized his troops efforts forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs dogs were used to hunt down natives who attempted to flee columbuss men tore across the land killing thousands of sick and unarmed natives soldiers would use their captives for sword practice attempting to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow the arawaks attempted to fight back against columbuss men but lacked their armor guns swords and horses when taken prisoner they were hanged or burned to death desperation led to mass suicides and infanticide among the natives in just two years under columbuss governorship over 125000 of the 250000300000 natives in haiti were dead and in three decades virtually every member of the gentle race had been wiped out disease warfare and harsh enslavement contributed to the depopulation within indigenous circles columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide samuel eliot morison a harvard historian and author of a multivolume biography on columbus writes the cruel policy initiated by columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide loewen laments that while haiti under the spanish is one of the primary instances of genocide in all human history only one major history text he reviewed mentions columbuss role in it black legend however some of these accounts may be part of black legend while others challenge the genocide narrative noble david cook writing about the black legend and the conquest of the americas wrote there were too few spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after old and new world contact he instead estimates that the death toll was caused by diseases like smallpox which according to some estimates had an 8090 fatality rate in native american populations disease played a significant role in the destruction of the natives indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1500 colonists who accompanied columbuss second expedition in 1493 by the end of 1494 disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the spanish settlers a native nahuatl account depicted the social breakdown that accompanied the pandemics a great many died from this plague and many others died of hunger they could not get up to search for food and everyone else was too sick to care for them so they starved to death in their beds when the pandemic finally struck in 1519 it wiped out much of the remaining native population charles c mann wrote it was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades some historians have argued that while brutal columbus was simply a product of his time and being a figure of the 15th century should not be judged by the morality of the 20th century physical appearance although an abundance of artwork involving christopher columbus exists no authentic contemporary portrait has been found james w loewen author of lies my teacher told me believes the various posthumous portraits have no historical value sometime between 1531 and 1536 alejo fernndez painted an altarpiece the virgin of the navigators that includes a depiction of columbus the painting was commissioned for a chapel in sevilles casa de contratacin house of trade and remains there as the earliest known painting about the discovery of the americas at the 1893 worlds columbian exposition 71 alleged portraits of columbus were displayed most did not match contemporary descriptions these writings describe him as having reddish or blond hair which turned to white early in his life light colored eyes as well as being a lighter-skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red accounts consistently describe columbus as a large and physically strong man of some six feet 183 metres or more in height easily taller than the average european of his day the most iconic image of columbus is a portrait by sebastiano del piombo which has been reproduced in many textbooks it agrees with descriptions of columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair but the painting dates from 1519 and cannot therefore have been painted from life furthermore the inscription identifying the subject as columbus was probably added later and the face shown differs from other images including that of the virgin of the navigators see also
