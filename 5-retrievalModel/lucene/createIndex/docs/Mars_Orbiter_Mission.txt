the mars orbiter mission mom also called mangalyaan mars-craft from sanskrit mangala mars and yna craft vehicle is a space probe orbiting mars since 24 september 2014 it was launched on 5 november 2013 by the indian space research organisation isro it is indias first interplanetary mission and it made it the fourth space agency to reach mars after roscosmos nasa and the european space agency it is the first asian nation to reach mars orbit and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt the mars orbiter mission probe lifted-off from the first launch pad at satish dhawan space centre sriharikota range shar andhra pradesh using a polar satellite launch vehicle pslv rocket c25 at 0908utc on 5 november 2013 the launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 october 2013 the mom probe spent about a month in earth orbit where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-mars injection on 30 november 2013 utc after a 298-day transit to mars it was inserted into mars orbit on 24 september 2014 the mission is a technology demonstrator project to develop the technologies for designing planning management and operations of an interplanetary mission it carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about mars to achieve its secondary scientific objective the spacecraft is currently being monitored from the spacecraft control centre at isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac in bengaluru with support from the indian deep space network idsn antennae at byalalu karnataka history on 23 november 2008 the first public acknowledgement of an unmanned mission to mars was announced by then-isro chairman g madhavan nair the mom mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the indian institute of space science and technology after the launch of lunar satellite chandrayaan-1 in 2008 prime minister manmohan singh approved the project on 3 august 2012 after the indian space research organisation completed 125 crore us17million of required studies for the orbiter the total project cost may be up to 454 crore us63million the satellite costs 153 crore us21million and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other isro projects the space agency had planned the launch on 28 october 2013 but was postponed to 5 november following the delay in isros spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the pacific ocean launch opportunities for a fuel-saving hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018 assembly of the pslv-xl launch vehicle designated c25 started on 5 august 2013 the mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at indian space research organisation satellite centre bengaluru and the finished spacecraft was shipped to sriharikota on 2 october 2013 for integration to the pslv-xl launch vehicle the satellites development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months despite the us federal government shutdown nasa reaffirmed on 5 october 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission during a meeting on 30 september 2014 nasa and isro officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore mars one of the working groups objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the maven orbiter and mom as well as other current and future mars missions cost the total cost of the mission was approximately 450 crore us73 million making it the least-expensive mars mission to date the low cost of the mission was ascribed by k radhakrishnan the chairman of isro to various factors including a modular approach few ground tests and long 1820 hour working days for scientists bbcs jonathan amos mentioned lower worker costs home-grown technologies simpler design and a significantly less complicated payload than nasas maven mission objectives the primary objective of the mission is to develop the technologies required for designing planning management and operations of an interplanetary mission the secondary objective is to explore mars surface features morphology mineralogy and martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments the main objectives are to develop the technologies required for designing planning management and operations of an interplanetary mission comprising the following major tasks orbit manoeuvres to transfer the spacecraft from earth-centred orbit to heliocentric trajectory and finally capture into martian orbit development of force models and algorithms for orbit and attitude orientation computations and analysis navigation in all phases maintain the spacecraft in all phases of the mission meeting power communications thermal and payload operation requirements incorporate autonomous features to handle contingency situations scientific objectives the scientific objectives deal with the following major aspects exploration of mars surface features by studying the morphology topography and mineralogy study the constituents of martian atmosphere including methane and co2 using remote sensing techniques study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere of mars effects of solar wind and radiation and the escape of volatiles to outer space the mission would also provide multiple opportunities to observe the martian moon phobos and also offer an opportunity to identify and re-estimate the orbits of asteroids seen

operations for the launch with ground stations at sriharikota port blair brunei and biak in indonesia and after the spacecrafts apogee became more than 100000km an 18m 59ft and a 32m 105ft diameter antenna of the indian deep space network were utilised the 18m 59ft dish antenna was used for communication with the craft until april 2014 after which the larger 32m 105ft antenna was used nasas deep space network is providing position data through its three stations located in canberra madrid and goldstone on the us west coast during the non-visible period of isros network the south african national space agencys sansa hartebeesthoek hbk ground station is also providing satellite tracking telemetry and command services communications communications are handled by two 230-watt twtas and two coherent transponders the antenna array consists of a low-gain antenna a medium-gain antenna and a high-gain antenna the high-gain antenna system is based on a single 22-metre 7ft 3in reflector illuminated by a feed at s-band it is used to transmit and receive the telemetry tracking commanding and data to and from the indian deep space network mission profile launch as originally conceived isro was to launch mom on its geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle gslv but as the gslv failed twice in 2010 and isro was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the mom project for at least three years isro opted to switch to the less-powerful polar satellite launch vehicle pslv since the pslv was not powerful enough to place mom on a direct-to-mars trajectory the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns to take advantage of the oberth effect to place itself on a trans-mars trajectory on 19 october 2013 isro chairman k radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching fiji the launch was rescheduled for 5 november 2013 isros pslv-xl placed the satellite into earth orbit at 0950utc on 5 november 2013 with a perigee of 2641km 1641mi an apogee of 239036km 148530mi and inclination of 1920 degrees with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed during the first three orbit raising operations isro progressively tested the spacecraft systems the orbiters dry mass is 500kg 1100lb and it carried 852kg 1878lb of fuel and oxidiser at launch its main engine which is a derivative of the system used on indias communications satellites uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from earth it was also used to slow down the probe for mars orbit insertion and subsequently for orbit corrections orbit raising manoeuvres several orbit raising operations were conducted from the spacecraft control centre scc at the isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac at peenya bengaluru on 6 7 8 10 12 and 16 november by using the spacecrafts on-board propulsion system and a series of perigee burns the first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results while the fourth was only partially successful however a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre a total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in earth orbit with a seventh burn conducted on 30 november to insert mom into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to mars the first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 november 2013 at 1947utc when the spacecrafts 440-newton 99lbf liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds with this engine firing the spacecrafts apogee was raised to 28825km 17911mi with a perigee of 252km 157mi the second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 november 2013 at 2048utc with a burn time of 5706 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40186km 24970mi the third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 november 2013 at 2040utc with a burn time of 707 seconds resulting in an apogee of 71636km 44513mi the fourth orbit raising manoeuvre starting at 2036utc on 10 november 2013 imparted an incremental velocity of 35ms 110fts to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135ms 440fts as a result of underburn by the motor because of this the apogee was boosted to 78276km 48638mi instead of the planned 100000km 62000mi when testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system the flow to the liquid engine stopped with consequent reduction in incremental velocity during the fourth orbit burn the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested when both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes the flow to the liquid engine stopped operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations however they could be operated independently of each other in sequence as a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 november 2013 that increased the apogee to 118642km 73721mi a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre the apogee was raised to 192874km 119846mi on 15 november 2013 1957utc in the final orbit raising manoeuvre trans-mars injection on 30 november 2013 at 1919utc a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of mom away from earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward mars the probe travelled a distance of 780000000 kilometres 480000000mi to reach mars trajectory correction maneuvers four trajectory corrections were originally planned but only three were carried out the first trajectory correction manoeuvre tcm was carried out on 11 december 2013 at 0100utc by firing the 22-newton 49lbf thrusters for a duration of 405 seconds after this event mom was following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in april 2014 was not required the second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 june 2014 at 1100utc by firing the spacecrafts 22 newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds the third planned trajectory correction manoeuvre was postponed due to the orbiters trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory the third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 39 seconds long on 22 september 2014 mars orbit insertion the plan was for an insertion into mars orbit on 24 september 2014 approximately 2 days after the arrival of nasas maven orbiter the 440-newton liquid apogee motor was test fired on 22 september at 0900utc for 3968 seconds about 41 hours before actual orbit insertion after these events the spacecraft performed a reverse manoeuvre to reorient from its deceleration burn and entered martian orbit status the orbit insertion put mom in a highly elliptical orbit around mars as planned with a period of 72 hours 51 minutes 51 seconds a periapsis of 4217km 2620mi and apoapsis of 769936km 478416mi at the end of the orbit insertion mom was left with 40kg 88lb of fuel on board more than the 20kg 44lb necessary for a six-month mission on 28 september 2014 mom controllers published the spacecrafts first global view of mars the image was captured by the mars colour camera mcc on 7 october 2014 the isro altered moms orbit so as to move it behind mars for comet siding springs flyby of the planet on 19 october 2014 the spacecraft consumed 19kg 4lb of fuel for the manoeuvre as a result moms apoapsis was reduced to 72000km 45000mi after the comet passed by mars isro reported that mom remained healthy on 4 march 2015 the isro reported that the msm instrument was functioning normally and are studying mars albedo the reflectivity of the planets surface the mars colour camera was also returning new images of the martian surface on 24 march 2015 mom completed its initial six-month mission in orbit around mars isro extended the mission by an additional six months the spacecraft has 37kg 82lb of propellant remaining and all five of its scientific instruments are working properly the orbiter can reportedly continue orbiting mars for several years with its remaining propellant a 17-day communications blackout occurred from 6 to 22 june 2015 while mars orbit took it behind the sun from earths view on 24 september 2015 isro released its mars atlas a 120-page scientific atlas containing images and data from the mars orbiter missions first year in orbit in march 2016 the first science results of the mission were published in geophysical research letters presenting measurements obtained by the spacecrafts menca instrument of the martian exosphere on 17 january 2017 moms orbit was altered to avoid the impending eclipse season with a burn of eight 22n thrusters for 431 seconds resulting in a velocity difference of 975 metres per second 351kmh using 20 kilograms 44lb of propellant leaving 13kg remaining eclipses were be avoided until september 2017 the battery is able to handle eclipses of up to 100 minutes on 19 may 2017 mom reached 1000 days 973 sols in orbit around mars in that time the spacecraft completed 388 orbits of the planet and relayed more than 715 images back to earth isro officials stated that it remains in good health on 24 september 2018 mom completed 4 years in its orbit around mars although the designed mission life was only six months over these years moms mars colour camera has captured over 980 images that were released to the public the probe is still in good health and continues to work nominally recognition in 2014 china referred to indias successful mars orbiter mission as the pride of asia the mars orbiter mission team won us-based national space societys 2015 space pioneer award in the science and engineering category nss said the award was given as the indian agency successfully executed a mars mission in its first attempt and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where with its high resolution camera it is taking full-disk colour imagery of mars very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past mostly on approach to the planet as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode these images will aid planetary scientists an illustration of the mars orbiter mission spacecraft is featured on the reverse of the 2000 currency note of india an image taken by the mars orbiter mission spacecraft was the cover photo of the november 2016 issue of national geographic magazine for their story mars race to the red planet follow-up mission isro plans to develop and launch a follow-up mission called mars orbiter mission 2 mom-2 or mangalyaan-2 with a greater scientific payload to mars in 2022-2023 the orbiter will use aerobraking to reduce apoapsis of its initial orbit and reach an altitude more suitable for scientific observation see also mars portal spaceflight portal india portal department
