robert hutchings goddard october5 1882 august10 1945 was an american engineer professor physicist and inventor who is credited with creating and building the worlds first liquid-fueled rocket goddard successfully launched his model on march 16 1926 ushering in an era of space flight and innovation he and his team launched 34 rockets between 1926 and 1941 achieving altitudes as high as 26km 16mi and speeds as fast as 885kmh 550mph goddards work as both theorist and engineer anticipated many of the developments that were to make spaceflight possible he has been called the man who ushered in the space age two of goddards 214 patented inventionsa multi-stage rocket 1914 and a liquid-fuel rocket 1914were important milestones toward spaceflight his 1919 monograph a method of reaching extreme altitudes is considered one of the classic texts of 20th-century rocket science goddard successfully applied three-axis control gyroscopes and steerable thrust to rockets to effectively control their flight although his work in the field was revolutionary goddard received very little public support for his research and development work the press sometimes ridiculed his theories of spaceflight as a result he became protective of his privacy and his work years after his death at the dawn of the space age he came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry along with robert esnault-pelterie konstantin tsiolkovsky and hermann oberth he not only recognized the potential of rockets for atmospheric research ballistic missiles and space travel but was the first to scientifically study design and construct the rockets needed to implement those ideas nasas goddard space flight center was named in goddards honor in 1959 early life and inspiration goddard was born in worcester massachusetts to nahum danford goddard 18591928 a farmer and fannie louise hoyt 18641920 robert was their only child to survive a younger son richard henry was born with a spinal deformity and died before his first birthday goddards family had roots in new england dating to the late 1600s shortly after his birth the family moved to boston with a curiosity about nature he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying essentially a country boy he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle in 1898 his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to worcester for the clear air on sundays the family attended the episcopal church and robert sang in the choir childhood experiment with the electrification of american cities in the 1880s the young goddard became interested in sciencespecifically engineering and technology when his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the familys carpet the five-year-olds imagination was sparked robert experimented believing he could jump higher if the zinc from a battery could be charged by scuffing his feet on the gravel walk but holding the zinc he could jump no higher than usual goddard halted the experiments after a warning from his mother that if he succeeded he could go sailing away and might not be able to come back he experimented with chemicals and created a cloud of smoke and an explosion in the house goddards father further encouraged roberts scientific interest by providing him with a telescope a microscope and a subscription to scientific american robert developed a fascination with flight first with kites and then with balloons he became a thorough diarist and documenter of his worka skill that would greatly benefit his later career these interests merged at age 16 when goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of aluminum shaping the raw metal in his home workshop and filling it with hydrogen after nearly five weeks of methodical documented efforts he finally abandoned the project remarking balloon will not go up aluminum is too heavy failior sic crowns enterprise however the lesson of this failure did not restrain goddards growing determination and confidence in his work cherry tree dream he became interested in space when he read h g wells science fiction classic the war of the worlds at 16 years old his dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on october 19 1899 the 17-year-old goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs he was transfixed by the sky and his imagination grew he later wrote on this day i climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn and as i looked toward the fields at the east i imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to mars and how it would look on a small scale if sent up from the meadow at my feet i have several photographs of the tree taken since with the little ladder i made to climb it leaning against it it seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft moving more rapidly above than below could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path i was a different boy when i descended the tree from when i ascended existence at last seemed very purposive for the rest of his life he observed october 19 as anniversary day a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration education and early studies it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow the young goddard was a thin and frail boy almost always in fragile health he suffered from stomach problems pleurisy colds and bronchitis and fell two years behind his classmates he became a voracious reader regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences aerodynamics and motion goddards interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of samuel langleys scientific papers in the periodical smithsonian in these papers langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air inspired by these articles the teenage goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight he noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers which he called the birds equivalent of ailerons he took exception to some of langleys conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to st nicholas magazine with his own ideas the editor of st nicholas declined to publish goddards letter remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that machines will not act with such intelligence goddard disagreed believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence around this time goddard read newtons principia mathematica and found that newtons third law of motion applied to motion in space he wrote later about his own tests of the law i began to realize that there might be something after all to newtons laws the third law was accordingly tested both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats in the little brook back of the barn and the said law was verified conclusively it made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered or invented it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics academics as his health improved goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at south high community school in worcester in 1901 he excelled in his coursework and his peers twice elected him class president making up for lost time he studied books on mathematics astronomy mechanics and composition from the school library at his graduation ceremony in 1904 he gave his class oration as valedictorian in his speech entitled on taking things for granted goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life just as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible so for the individual since we cannot know just what are his limitations we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth fame or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been at some time in the same condition as he and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow goddard enrolled at worcester polytechnic institute in 1904 he quickly impressed the head of the physics department a wilmer duff with his thirst for knowledge and duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor at wpi goddard joined the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate miriam olmstead an honor student who had graduated with him as salutatorian eventually she and goddard were engaged but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909 goddard received his bs degree in physics from worcester polytechnic in 1908 and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics he began his graduate studies at clark university in worcester in the fall of 1909 goddard received his ma degree in physics from clark university in 1910 and then stayed at clark to complete his phd in physics in 1911 he spent another year at clark as an honorary fellow in physics and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at princeton universitys palmer physical laboratory first scientific writings the high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article the navigation of space which he submitted to the popular science news the journals editor returned it saying that they could not use it in the near future while still an undergraduate goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing aeroplanes using gyro-stabilization he submitted the idea to scientific american which published the paper in 1907 goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight his proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional gyroscopes his first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on february 2 1909 goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rockets efficiency using methods differing from conventional solid-fuel rockets he wrote in his journal about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer he believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants ie half of the heat energy of combustion converted to kinetic energy of the exhaust gases first patents in the decades around 1910 radio was a new technology fertile for innovation in 1912 while working at princeton university goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators in order to generate radio-frequency power he invented a vacuum tube that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube us patent 1159209 was issued on november 2 1915 this was the first use of a vacuum tube to amplify a signal preceding even lee de forests claim by 1912 he had in his spare time using calculus developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity with respect to the rocket frame of the exhaust gases his first goal was to build a sounding rocket with which to study the atmosphere not only would such investigation aid meteorology but it was necessary to determine temperature density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles he was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space since most scientists especially in the united states did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas later in 1933 goddard said that in no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel test by test and step by step until one day we succeed cost what it may unfortunately in early 1913 goddard became seriously ill with tuberculosis and had to leave his position at princeton he then returned to worcester where he began a prolonged process of recovery his doctors did not expect him to live he decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise and he gradually improved when his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed he kept them arguingi have to live to do this work it was during this period of recuperation however that goddard began to produce some of his most important work as his symptoms subsided he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at princeton in the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of worcester patents were considered essential not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery he began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else didand he would have to pay to use them in may 1913 he wrote concerning his first rocket patent applications his father brought them to a patent lawyer in a firm in worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration goddards first patent application was submitted in october 1913 in 1914 his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered the first us patent 1102653 described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid explosive material the second us patent 1103503 described a rocket fueled with a solid fuel explosive material or with liquid propellants gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide the two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry overall he published 214 patents some posthumously by his wife early rocketry research in the fall of 1914 goddards health had improved and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at clark university his position at clark allowed him to further his rocketry research he ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests goddards first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at clark the launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor and goddard had to reassure him that his experiments while being serious study were also quite harmless after this incident goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab in order to limit any disturbance at the clark physics lab goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency he found his earlier estimates to be verified powder rockets were converting only about 2 percent of their fuel into thrust at this point he applied de laval nozzles which were generally used with steam turbine engines and these greatly improved efficiency of the several definitions of rocket efficiency goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the internal efficiency of the engine the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion expressed as a percentage by mid-summer of 1915 goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of 6728 feet 2051 meters per second connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion nozzles goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63 and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet 2134 meters per second few would recognize it at the time but this little engine was a major breakthrough these experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape earth and travel into space this engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the smithsonian institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and ultimately space exploration goddard realized however that it would take the more efficient liquid propellants to reach space later that year goddard designed an elaborate experiment at the clark physics lab and proved that a rocket would perform in a vacuum such as that in space he believed it would but many other scientists were not yet convinced his experiment demonstrated that a rockets performance actually decreases under atmospheric pressure from 1916 to 1917 goddard built and tested experimental ion thrusters which he thought might be used for propulsion in the near-vacuum conditions of outer space the small glass engines he built were tested at atmospheric pressure where they generated a stream of ionized air smithsonian institution sponsorship by 1916 the cost of goddards rocket research had become too great for his modest teaching salary to bear he began to solicit potential sponsors for financial assistance beginning with the smithsonian institution the national geographic society and the aero club of america in his letter to the smithsonian in september 1916 goddard claimed he had achieved a 63 efficiency and a nozzle velocity of almost 2438 meters per second with these performance levels he believed a rocket could vertically lift a weight of 1 lb 045 kg to a height of 232 miles 373 km with an initial launch weight of only 896 lbs 4064 kg earths atmosphere at 80 to 100 miles 130 to 160km altitude begins to have a significant drag effect on orbiting satellites and can be considered to end about that area the smithsonian was interested and asked goddard to elaborate upon his initial inquiry goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared entitled a method of reaching extreme altitudes in january 1917 the smithsonian agreed to provide goddard with a five-year grant totaling us5000 afterward clark was able to contribute us3500 and the use of their physics lab to the project worcester polytechnic institute also allowed him to use its abandoned magnetics laboratory on the edge of campus during this time as a safe place for testing it wasnt until two years later at the insistence of dr arthur g webster the world-renowned head of clarks physics department that goddard arranged for the smithsonian to publish his work while at clark university goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the suns rays on a machined piece of quartz that was sprayed with mercury which then heated water and drove an electric generator goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors and he had his findings published in the november 1929 issue of popular science goddards military rocket not all of goddards early work was geared towards space travel as the united states entered world war i in 1917 the countrys universities began to lend their services to the war effort goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications including mobile artillery field weapons and naval torpedoes he made proposals to the navy and army no record exists in his papers of any interest by the navy to goddards inquiry however army ordnance was quite interested and goddard met several times with army personnel during this time goddard was also contacted by a civilian industrialist in worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military however as the businessmans enthusiasm grew so did goddards suspicion talks eventually broke down as goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business however an army signal corps officer tried to make goddard cooperate but he was called off by general george squier of the signal corps who had been contacted by secretary of the smithsonian institution charles walcott goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to protect his ideas these events led to the signal corps sponsoring goddards work during world war i goddard proposed to the army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon the launcher concept became the precursor to the bazooka the rocket-powered recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of goddard as a side project under army contract of his work on rocket propulsion goddard during his tenure at clark university and working at mount wilson observatory for security reasons designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during world war i he and his co-worker dr clarence n hickman successfully demonstrated his rocket to the us army signal corps at aberdeen proving ground maryland on november 6 1918 using two music stands for a launch platform the army was impressed but the compigne armistice was signed only five days later and further development was discontinued as world war i ended the delay in the development of the bazooka and other weapons was a result of goddards serious bout with tuberculosisthe long recovery required goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the us government at indian head maryland until 1923 but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen later the former clark university researcher dr clarence n hickman and army officers col leslie skinner and lt edward uhl continued goddards work on the bazooka a shaped-charge warhead was attached to the rocket leading to the tank-killing weapon used in world war ii and to many other powerful rocket weapons a method of reaching extreme altitudes in 1919 goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed dr webster realized that goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself so goddard asked the smithsonian institution if it would publish the report he had submitted in late 1916 in late 1919 the smithsonian published goddards groundbreaking work a method of reaching extreme altitudes the report describes goddards mathematical theories of rocket flight his experiments with solid-fuel rockets and the possibilities he saw of exploring earths atmosphere and beyond along with konstantin tsiolkovskys earlier work the exploration of cosmic space by means of reaction devices which was not widely disseminated outside russia goddards book is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide goddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade nitrocellulose smokeless powder a critical breakthrough was the use of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the swedish inventor gustaf de laval the de laval nozzle allows the most efficient isentropic conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion by means of this nozzle goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from two percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over mach 7 though most of this work dealt with the theoretical and experimental relations between propellant rocket mass thrust and velocity a final section entitled calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an infinite altitude discussed the possible uses of rockets not only to reach the upper atmosphere but to escape from earths gravitation altogether he determined that a rocket with an effective exhaust velocity see specific impulse of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds would be able to send a one-pound payload to an infinite height included as a thought experiment was the idea of launching a rocket to the moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface so as to be visible through a telescope he discussed the matter seriously down to an estimate of the amount of powder required goddards conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 321 tons could produce a flash just visible from earth assuming a final payload weight of 107 pounds goddard eschewed publicity because he did not have time to reply to criticism of his work and his imaginative ideas about space travel were shared only with private groups he trusted he did though publish and talk about the rocket principle and sounding rockets since these subjects were not too far out in a letter to the smithsonian dated march 1920 he discussed photographing the moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates the use of solar energy in space and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion in that same letter goddard clearly describes the concept of the ablative heat shield suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor response to a reporters question following criticism in the new york times 1920 publicity and criticism the publication of goddards document gained him national attention from us newspapers most of it negative although goddards discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule even the smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public david lasser who co-founded the american rocket society wrote in 1931 that goddard was subjected in the press to the most violent attacks on january 12 1920 a front-page story in the new york times believes rocket can reach moon reported a smithsonian press release about a multiple-charge high-efficiency rocket the chief application envisaged was the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the earths atmosphere the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery since the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down but it also mentioned a proposal to send to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which in being ignited on impact would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope this would be the only way of proving that the rocket had really left the attraction of the earth as the apparatus would never come back once it had escaped that attraction new york times editorial on january 13 1920 the day after its front-page story about goddards rocket an unsigned new york times editorial in a section entitled topics of the times scoffed at the proposal the article which bore the title a severe strain on credulity began with apparent approval but soon went on to cast serious doubt as a method of sending a missile to the higher and even highest part of the earths atmospheric envelope professor goddards multiple-charge rocket is a practicable and therefore promising device such a rocket too might carry self-recording instruments to be released at the limit of its flight and conceivable parachutes would bring them safely to the ground it is not obvious however that the instruments would return to the point of departure indeed it is obvious that they would not for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do and the rocket or what was left of it after the last explosion would need to be aimed with amazing skill and in a dead calm to fall on the spot whence it started new paragraph but that is a slight inconvenience at least from the scientific standpoint though it might be serious enough from that of the always innocent bystander a few hundred or thousand yards from the firing line the article pressed further on goddards proposal to launch rockets beyond the atmosphere after the rocket quits our air and really starts on its longer journey its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left to claim that it would be is to deny a fundamental law of dynamics and only dr einstein and his chosen dozen so few and fit are licensed to do that the basis of that criticism was the then-common belief that thrust was produced by the rocket exhaust pushing against the atmosphere goddard realized that newtons third law reaction was the actual principle finally in the follow-on section his plan is not original the writer assumed wrongly that goddards understanding of newtons laws was flawed that professor goddard with his chair in clark college and the countenancing of the smithsonian institution does not know the relation of action and reaction and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to reactto say that would be absurd of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools unbeknownst to the times thrust is possible in a vacuum as the writer would have discovered had he read goddards paper aftermath a week after the new york times editorial goddard released a signed statement to the associated press attempting to restore reason to what had become a sensational story too much attention has been concentrated on the proposed flash powder experiment and too little on the exploration of the atmosphere whatever interesting possibilities there may be of the method that has been proposed other than the purpose for which it was intended no one of them could be undertaken without first exploring the atmosphere in 1924 goddard published an article how my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum in popular science in which he explained the physics and gave details of the vacuum experiments he had performed to prove the theory but no matter how he tried to explain his results he was not understood after one of goddards experiments in 1929 a local worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline moon rocket misses target by 2387992miles goddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years this was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone except during the two world wars which limited the impact of much of his work another limiting factor was the lack of support from the american government military and academia all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space and for military applications as germany became ever more war-like he refused to communicate with german rocket experimenters though he received more and more of their correspondence a correction forty-nine years after its editorial mocking goddard on july 17 1969the day after the launch of apollo 11the new york times published a short item under the headline a correction the three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of isaac newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere the times regrets the error first liquid-fueled flight first static tests goddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer liquid fuel rockets in september 1921 and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in november 1923 it had a cylindrical combustion chamber using impinging jets to mix and atomize liquid oxygen and gasoline in 192425 goddard had problems developing a high-pressure piston pump to send fuel to the combustion chamber he wanted to scale up the experiments but his funding would not allow such growth he decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of inert gas a technique used today the liquid oxygen some of which evaporated provided its own pressure on december 6 1925 he tested the simpler pressure feed system he conducted a static test on the firing stand at the clark university physics laboratory the engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack it was a major success for goddard proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible the test moved goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel goddard conducted an additional test in december and two more in january 1926 after that he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system first flight goddard launched the first liquid-fueled gasoline and liquid oxygen rocket on march 16 1926 in auburn massachusetts present at the launch were his crew chief henry sachs esther goddard and percy roope who was clarks assistant professor in the physics department goddards diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement march 16 went to auburn with sachs in am esther and mr roope came out at 1 pm tried rocket at 230 it rose 41 feet went 184 feet in 25 secs after the lower half of the nozzle burned off brought materials to lab his diary entry the next day elaborated march 17 1926 the first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at aunt effies farm in auburn even though the release was pulled the rocket did not rise at first but the flame came out and there was a steady roar after a number of seconds it rose slowly until it cleared the frame and then at express train speed curving over to the left and striking the ice and snow still going at a rapid rate the rocket which was later dubbed nell rose just 41feet during a 25-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets the launch site is now a national historic landmark the goddard rocket launching site viewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of nell the complete rocket is significantly taller than goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping the rockets combustion chamber is the small cylinder at the top the nozzle is visible beneath it the fuel tank which is also part of the rocket is the larger cylinder opposite goddards torso the fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motors exhaust by an asbestos cone asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks providing both support and fuel transport this layout is no longer used since the experiment showed that this was no more stable than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base by may after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position at the lower end of the rocket goddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces he added movable vanes in the exhaust controlled by a gyroscope to control and steer his rocket the germans used this technique in their v-2 he also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today lindbergh and goddard after a launch of one of goddards rockets in july 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers charles lindbergh learned of his work in a new york times article at the time lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of aviation even space flight in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step after checking with the massachusetts institute of technology mit and being assured that goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot he phoned goddard in november 1929 professor goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at clark university upon meeting goddard lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research and goddard was similarly impressed by the fliers interest he discussed his work openly with lindbergh forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life while having long since become reticent to share his ideas goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream and whom he felt he could trust by late 1929 goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch he was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for goddards work and lent his famous name to goddards work in 1930 lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding which proved all but impossible to find following the recent us stock market crash in october 1929 guggenheim sponsorship in the spring of 1930 lindbergh finally found an ally in the guggenheim family financier daniel guggenheim agreed to fund goddards research over the next four years for a total of 100000 18million today the guggenheim family especially harry guggenheim would continue to support goddards work in the years to come the goddards soon moved to roswell new mexico because of the military potential of the rocket goddard lindbergh harry guggenheim the smithsonian institution and others tried in 1940 before the us entered world war ii to convince the army and navy of its value goddards services were offered but there was no interest initially two young imaginative officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with goddard just prior to the war the navy beat the army to the punch and secured his services to build liquid-fueled rockets for jet-assisted take-off jato of aircraft these rockets were the precursors to some of the large rocket engines that launched the space age lack of vision in the united states before world war ii there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the united states concerning the potential of rocketry especially in washington although the weather bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in goddards rocket for atmospheric research the bureau could not secure governmental funding between the world wars the guggenheim foundation was the main source of funding for goddards research goddards liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country according to aerospace historian eugene emme but was noticed and advanced by other nations especially the germans goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the smithsonian he knew that the germans were very interested in rocketry and said he would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race and he wondered how soon the european theorists would begin to build rockets in 1936 the us military attach in berlin asked charles lindbergh to visit germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation although the luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower they were silent on the subject of rocketry when lindbergh told goddard of this behavior goddard said yes they must have plans for the rocket when will our own people in washington listen to reason most of the uss largest universities were also slow to realize rocketrys potential just before world war ii the head of the aeronautics department at mit at a meeting held by the army air corps to discuss project funding said that the california institute of technology caltech can take the buck rogers job rocket research in 1941 goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from mit but couldnt find one who was interested there were some exceptions mit was at least teaching basic rocketry and caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics after the war dr jerome hunsaker of mit having studied goddards patents stated that every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a goddard rocket while away in roswell goddard was still head of the physics department at clark university and clark deserves credit for allowing him to devote most of his time to rocket research likewise the university of california los angeles ucla permitted astronomer samuel herrick to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination herrick began corresponding with goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field which he named astrodynamics herrick said that goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of celestial mechanics to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation roswell new mexico with new financial backing goddard eventually relocated to roswell new mexico in summer of 1930 where he worked with his team of technicians in near-isolation and relative secrecy for years he had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work and roswell seemed ideal here they would not endanger anyone would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate which was also better for goddards health the locals valued personal privacy knew goddard desired his and when travelers asked where goddards facilities were located they would likely be misdirected by september 1931 his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins he began experimenting with gyroscopic guidance and made a flight test of such a system in april 1932 a gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust similar to the system used by the german v-2 over 10years later though the rocket crashed after a short ascent the guidance system had worked and goddard considered the test a success a temporary loss of funding from the guggenheims as a result of the depression forced goddard in spring of 1932 to return to clark university until the autumn of 1934 when funding resumed upon his return to roswell he began work on his a series of rockets 4 to 45meters long and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen the gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket between the propellant tanks the a-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance as the gyroscopic system was being repaired on march 8 1935 it flew up to 1000 feet then turned into the wind and goddard reported roared in a powerful descent across the prairie at close to or at the speed of sound on march 28 1935 the a-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of 091mi 4800ft using his gyroscopic guidance system it then turned to a nearly horizontal path flew 13000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well in 19361939 goddard began work on the k and l series rockets which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude the k series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine achieving a thrust of 624lbsin february 1936 this work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through in 1923 goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber but he deemed the idea too complicated he then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber but this scheme did not work well and the larger rockets failed returning to a smaller design the l-13 reached an altitude of 27 kilometers 17mi 8900ft the highest of any of goddards rockets weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire goddard experimented with many of the features of todays large rockets such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles in november 1936 he flew the worlds first rocket l-7 with multiple chambers hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber it had four combustion chambers reached a height of 200 feet and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through this flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided from 1940 to 1941 work was done on the p series of rockets which used propellant turbopumps also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen the lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures permitting a more powerful engine greater thrust and a lighter structure lighter tanks and no pressurization tank but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet the turbopumps worked well however and goddard was pleased when goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps harry guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him none were interested as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive goddards team was therefore left on its own and from september 1938 to june 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines esther later said that the pump tests were the most trying and disheartening phase of the research goddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control goddard did not consider them failures however because he felt that he always learned something from a test most of his work involved static tests which are a standard procedure today before a flight test general jimmy doolittle jimmy doolittle was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history he recalls in his autobiography i became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when i met robert h goddard who laid the foundation while with shell oil i worked with him on the development of a type of fuel harry guggenheim and charles lindbergh arranged for then major doolittle to discuss with goddard a special blend of gasoline doolittle flew himself to roswell in october 1938 and was given a tour of goddards shop and a short course in rocketry he then wrote a memo including a rather detailed description of goddards rocket in closing he said interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles awaywho knows in july 1941 he wrote goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research the army was interested only in jato at this point however doolittle and lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the us and doolittle remained in touch with goddard shortly after world war ii doolittle spoke to an american rocket society conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended his talk concerned dr robert goddard he later stated that at that time we in the aeronautics field had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry in 1956 he was appointed chairman of the national adviser committee for aeronautics naca because the previous chairman jerome c hunsaker thought doolittle to be more sympathetic than other scientists and engineers to the rocket which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon doolittle was instrumental in the successful transition of the naca to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 1958 he was offered the position as first administrator of nasa but he turned it down launch history between 1926 and 1941 the following 35 rockets were launched analysis of results as an instrument for reaching extreme altitudes goddards rockets were not very successful they did not achieve an altitude greater than 27km in 1937 while a balloon sonde had already reached 35km in 1921 by contrast german rocket scientists had achieved an altitude of 24km with the a-2 rocket in 1934 8km by 1939 with the a-5 and 196km in 1942 with the a-4 v-2 launched vertically reaching the outer limits of the atmosphere and into space goddards pace was slower than the germans because he did not have the resources they did simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal he was trying with a methodical approach to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry he had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes when world war ii intervened and changed the path of american history he hoped to return to his experiments in roswell after the war although goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the united states army between world wars he was rebuffed since the army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons german military intelligence by contrast had paid attention to goddards work the goddards noticed that some mail had been opened and some mailed reports had gone missing an accredited military attach to the us friedrich von boetticher sent a four-page report to the abwehr in 1936 and the spy gustav guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information claiming to have visited roswell and witnessed a launch the abwehr was very interested and responded with more questions about goddards work guellichs reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling but thereafter the germans received very little information about goddard the soviet union had a spy in the us navy bureau of aeronautics in 1935 she gave them a report goddard had written for the navy in 1933 it contained results of tests and flights and suggestions for military uses of his rockets the soviets considered this to be very valuable information it provided few design details but gave them the direction and knowledge about goddards progress annapolis maryland navy lieutenant charles f fischer who had visited goddard in roswell earlier and gained his confidence believed goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the bureau of aeronautics in september 1941 that goddard could build the jato unit the navy desired while still in roswell and before the navy contract took effect goddard began in september to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a pby seaplane by may 1942 he had a unit that could meet the navys requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway in february he received part of a pby with bullet holes apparently acquired in the pearl harbor attack goddard wrote to guggenheim that i can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation in april fischer notified goddard that the navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the engineering experiment station at annapolis esther worried that a move to the climate of maryland would cause roberts health to deteriorate faster objected but the patriotic goddard replied esther dont you know theres a war on fischer also questioned the move as goddard could work just as well in roswell goddard simply answered i was wondering when you would ask me fischer had wanted to offer him something biggera long range missilebut jato was all he could manage hoping for a greater project later it was a case of a square peg in a round hole according to a disappointed goddard goddard and his team had already been in annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust jato engine when he received a navy telegram forwarded from roswell ordering him to annapolis lt fischer asked for a crash effort by august his engine was producing 800lbs of thrust for 20 seconds and fischer was anxious to try it on a pby on the sixth test run with all bugs worked out the pby piloted by fischer was pushed into the air from the severn river fischer landed and prepared to launch again goddard had wanted to check the unit but radio contact with the pby had been lost on the seventh try the engine caught fire the plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted because goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute there was no explosion and no lives were lost the problems cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling cheaper safer solid fuel jato engines were eventually selected by the armed forces an engineer later said putting goddards rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow despite goddards efforts to convince the navy that liquid-fueled rockets had greater potential he said that the navy had no interest in long-range missiles however the navy asked him to perfect the throttleable jato engine goddard made improvements to the engine and in november it was demonstrated to the navy and some officials from washington fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls the engine blasted out over the severn at full throttle with no hesitation idled and roared again at various thrust levels the test was perfect exceeding the navys requirements the unit was able to be stopped and restarted and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1000 pounds for over 15 seconds a navy commander commented that it was like being thor playing with thunderbolts goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane the goddards celebrated by attending the army-navy football game and attending the fischers cocktail party this engine was the basis of the curtiss-wright xlr25-cw-1 two-chamber 15000-pound thrust engine that powered the bell x-2 research rocket plane after world war ii goddards team and some patents went to curtiss-wright corporation although his death in august 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine it was a direct descendent of his design in september 1956 the x-2 was the first plane to reach 126000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded mach 3 32 before losing control and crashing the x-2 program advanced technology in areas such as steel alloys and aerodynamics at high mach numbers v-2 wernher von braun when asked about his work following world war ii in the spring of 1945 goddard saw a captured german v-2 ballistic missile in the naval laboratory in annapolis maryland where he had been working under contract the unlaunched rocket had been captured by the us army from the mittelwerk factory in the harz mountains and samples began to be shipped by special mission v-2 on 22 may 1945 after a thorough inspection goddard was convinced that the germans had stolen his work though the design details were not exactly the same the basic design of the v-2 was similar to one of goddards rockets the v-2 however was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by goddard the peenemnde rocket group led by wernher von braun may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer hermann oberth they also had the benefit of intensive state funding large-scale production facilities using slave labor and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs oberth was a theorist and had never built a rocket or a working engine nevertheless in 1963 von braun reflecting on the history of rocketry said of goddard his rockets may have been rather crude by present-day standards but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles he once recalled that goddards experiments in liquid fuel saved us years of work and enabled us to perfect the v-2 years before it would have been possible after world war ii von braun reviewed goddards patents and believed they contained enough technical information to build a large missile three features developed by goddard appeared in the v-2 1 turbopumps were used to inject fuel into the combustion chamber 2 gyroscopically controlled vanes in the nozzle stabilized the rocket until external vanes in the air could do so and 3 excess alcohol was fed in around the combustion chamber walls so that a blanket of evaporating gas protected the engine walls from the combustion heat the germans had been watching goddards progress before the war and became convinced that large liquid fuel rockets were feasible general walter dornberger head of the v-2 project used the idea that they were in a race with the us and that goddard had disappeared to work with the navy to persuade hitler to raise the priority of the v-2 it was a strategic mistake however to expend an estimated one-half billion war-era-dollars not counting slave labor for a terror weapon that did not create the fear desired and lacked the accuracy to be very effective against military targets resources could have been better used on existing or new more effective weapons goddards secrecy goddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians frank malina who was then studying rocketry at the california institute of technology visited goddard in august 1936 goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research other than that which had already been published in liquid-propellant rocket development theodore von krmn malinas mentor at the time was unhappy with goddards attitude and later wrote naturally we at caltech wanted as much information as we could get from goddard for our mutual benefit but goddard believed in secrecy the trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it however at an earlier point von krmn said that malina was highly enthusiastic after his visit and that caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket based on goddards work and patents malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in goddards shop goddards concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers his approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support george sutton who became a rocket scientist working with von brauns team in the late 1940s said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for goddards patents and depending on the german team for knowledge and guidance he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the us at that early period though germany and the soviet union had copies of some of them the patent office did not release rocket patents during world war ii however the aerojet engineering corporation an offshoot of the guggenheim aeronautical laboratory at caltech galcit filed two patent applications in sep 1943 referencing goddards us patent 1102653 for the multistage rocket by 1939 von krmns galcit had received army air corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off goddard learned of this in 1940 and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered malina could not understand why the army did not arrange for an exchange of information between goddard and caltech since both were under government contract at the same time goddard did not think he could be of that much help to caltech because they were designing rockets with solid fuel while he was using liquid fuels goddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s which he believed had harmed his professional reputation he also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did feeling that his time was extremely constrained goddards health was frequently poor as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis and he was uncertain about how long he had to live he felt therefore that he hadnt the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him in 1932 goddard wrote to h g wells how many more years i shall be able to work on the problem i do not know i hope as long as i live there can be no thought of finishing for aiming at the stars both literally and figuratively is a problem to occupy generations so that no matter how much progress one makes there is always the thrill of just beginning goddard spoke to professional groups published articles and papers and patented his ideas but while he discussed basic principles he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory he tended to avoid any mention of space flight and spoke only of high-altitude research since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific however goddards tendency to secrecy was not absolute nor was he totally uncooperative in 1945 galcit was building the wac corporal for the army but was having trouble with the rockets engine performance frank malina went to annapolis and consulted with goddard and they arrived at a solution to the liquid propellant problem which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket during the first and second world wars goddard offered his services patents and technology to the military and made some significant contributions just before the second world war several young army officers and some higher-ranking ones believed goddards research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work toward the end of his life goddard realizing he was no longer going to be able to make significant progress alone in his field joined the american rocket society and became a director he made plans to work in the budding us aerospace industry with curtiss-wright taking most of his team with him personal life on june 21 1924 goddard married esther christine kisk march 31 1901 june 4 1982 a secretary in clark universitys presidents office whom he had met in 1919 she became enthusiastic about rocketry and photographed some of his work as well as aided him in his experiments and paperwork including accounting they enjoyed going to the movies in roswell and participated in community organizations such as the rotary and the womans club he painted the new mexican scenery sometimes with artist peter hurd and played the piano she played bridge while he read esther said robert participated in the community and readily accepted invitations to speak to church and service groups the couple did not have children after his death she sorted out goddards papers and secured 131 additional patents on his work concerning goddards religious views he was raised as an episcopalian though he was not outwardly religious the goddards were associated with the episcopal church in roswell and he attended occasionally he once spoke to a young peoples group on the relationship of science and religion goddards serious bout with tuberculosis weakened his lungs affecting his ability to work and was one reason he liked to work alone in order to avoid argument and confrontation with others and use his time fruitfully he labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span after arriving in roswell goddard applied for life insurance but when the company doctor examined him he said that goddard belonged in a bed in switzerland where he could get the best care goddards health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of maryland to work for the navy he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945 he continued to work able to speak only in a whisper until surgery was required and he died in august of that year in baltimore maryland he was buried in hope cemetery in his home town of worcester massachusetts legacy influence goddard was credited with 214 patents for his work 131 of these were awarded after his death goddard influenced several people who went on to do significant work in the us space program such as robert truax usn milton rosen naval research laboratory and nasa astronauts buzz aldrin and jim lovell nasa flight controller gene kranz astrodynamicist samuel herrick ucla and general jimmy doolittle us army and naca goddard received the langley gold medal from the smithsonian institution in 1960 and the congressional gold medal in september 16 1959 the goddard space flight center a nasa facility in greenbelt maryland was established in 1959 the crater goddard on the moon is also named

from his high school graduation oration on taking things for granted june 1904 on the afternoon of october 19 1899 i climbed a tall cherry tree and armed with a saw which i still have and a hatchet started to trim the dead limbs from the cherry tree it was one of the quiet colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in october in new england and as i looked towards the fields at the east i imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to mars i was a different boy when i descended the tree from when i ascended for existence at last
