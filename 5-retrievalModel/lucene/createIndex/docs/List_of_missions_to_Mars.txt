missions locations of selected mars landers and rovers there are a number of derelict orbiters around mars whose location is not known precisely there is a proposal to search for small moons dust rings and old orbiters with the optical navigation camera on the mars reconnaissance orbiter there should be 8 derelict mars orbiters barring unforeseen events if they have not decayed as of 2016 one example is mariner 9 which entered mars orbit in 1971 and is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022 when the spacecraft is projected to enter the martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planets surface the viking 1 orbiter is predicted not to decay until at least 2019 one orbiter that is confirmed to have undergone mars atmospheric entry is mars climate orbiter see also list of mars orbiters future missions in development proposals missions to the moons of mars missions dedicated to explore the two moons of mars phobos and deimos many missions to mars have also included dedicated observations of the moons while this section is about missions focused solely on them there have been three unsuccessful dedicated missions and many proposals because of the proximity of the mars moons to mars any mission to them may also be considered a mission to mars from some perspectives there have been at least three proposals in the united states discovery program including padme pandora and merlin the esa has also considered a sample return mission one of the latest known as martian moon sample return or mmsr and it may use heritage from an asteroid sample return mission in japan the institute of space and astronautical science isas is developing a sample return mission to phobos due to launch in 2024 this mission is called martian moons exploration mmx and is proposed as a flagship strategic large mission mmx will build on the expertise the japanese space agency jaxa would gain through the hayabusa2 and slim missions as of january 2018 mmx is set for launch in september 2024 three missions to land on phobos have been launched the phobos program in the late 1980s saw the launch of fobos 1 and fobos 2 while the fobos-grunt sample return mission was launched in 2011 none of these missions were successful fobos 1 failed en route to mars fobos 2 failed shortly before landing and fobos-grunt never left low earth orbit missions sent to the martian system have returned data on phobos and deimos and missions specifically dedicated to the moons are a subset of missions mars that often include dedicated goals to acquire data about these moons an example of this is the imaging campaigns by mars express of the mars moons osiris-rex 2 was a proposal to make or a double mission with the other one collecting samples from the two mars moons in 2012 it was stated that this mission would be the both quickest and least expensive way to get samples from the moons the red rocks project a part of lockheed martins stepping stones to mars program proposed to explore mars robotically from deimos undeveloped concepts 1970s mars 4nm and mars 5nm projects intended by the soviet union for heavy marsokhod in 1973 according to initial plan of 1970 and mars sample return planned for 1975 the missions were to be launched on the failed n1 rocket mars 5m mars-79 double-launching soviet sample return mission planned to 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems voyager-mars usa 1970s two orbiters and two landers launched by a single saturn v rocket 1990s vesta the multiaimed soviet mission developed in cooperation with european countries for realisation in 19911994 but canceled due to the soviet union disbanding included the flyby of mars with delivering the aerostat and small landers or penetrators followed by flybys of 1 ceres or 4 vesta and some other asteroids with impact of penetrator on the one of them mars aerostat russianfrench balloon part for cancelled vesta mission and then for failed mars 96 mission originally planned for the 1992 launch window postponed to 1994 and then to 1996 before being cancelled mars together combined us and russian mission study in the 1990s to be launched by a molinya with possible us orbiter or lander mars environmental survey set of 16 landers planned for 19992009 mars-98 russian mission including an orbiter lander and rover planned for 1998 launch opportunity as repeat of failured mars 96 mission and cancelled due to lack of funding 2000s mars surveyor 2001 lander october 2001 mars lander refurbished became phoenix lander kitty hawk mars
