the grand canyon hopi ongtupqa yavapai wikaila navajo tskooh hatsoh spanish gran can is a steep-sided canyon carved by the colorado river in arizona united states the grand canyon is 277 miles 446km long up to 18 miles 29km wide and attains a depth of over a mile 6093 feet or 1857 meters the canyon and adjacent rim are contained within grand canyon national park the kaibab national forest grand canyon-parashant national monument the hualapai indian reservation the havasupai indian reservation and the navajo nation president theodore roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the grand canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery nearly two billion years of earths geological history have been exposed as the colorado river and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the colorado plateau was uplifted while some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists several recent studies support the hypothesis that the colorado river established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago since that time the colorado river has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon for thousands of years the area has been continuously inhabited by native americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves the pueblo people considered the grand canyon a holy site and made pilgrimages to it the first european known to have viewed the grand canyon was garca lpez de crdenas from spain who arrived in 1540 geography the grand canyon is a river valley in the colorado plateau that exposes uplifted proterozoic and paleozoic strata and is also one of the six distinct physiographic sections of the colorado plateau province it is not the deepest canyon in the world kali gandaki gorge in nepal is much deeper however the grand canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape geologically it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon these rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the north american continent uplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the colorado plateau the higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the colorado river drainage area but not enough to change the grand canyon area from being semi-arid the uplift of the colorado plateau is uneven and the kaibab plateau that grand canyon bisects is over one thousand feet 300m higher at the north rim about 1000ft or 300m than at the south rim almost all runoff from the north rim which also gets more rain and snow flows toward the grand canyon while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the south rim flows away from the canyon following the general tilt the result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side temperatures on the north rim are generally lower than those on the south rim because of the greater elevation averaging 8000 feet or 2400 metres above sea level heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months access to the north rim via the primary route leading to the canyon state route 67 is limited during the winter season due to road closures geology the grand canyon is part of the colorado river basin which has developed over the past 70 million years in part based on apatite u-thhe thermochronometry showing that grand canyon reached a depth near to the modern depth by 20 ma a recent study examining caves near grand canyon places their origins beginning about 17 million years ago previous estimates had placed the age of the canyon at 56 million years the study which was published in the journal science in 2008 used uranium-lead dating to analyze calcite deposits found on the walls of nine caves throughout the canyon there is a substantial amount of controversy because this research suggests such a substantial departure from prior widely supported scientific consensus in december 2012 a study published in the journal science claimed new tests had suggested the grand canyon could be as old as 70 million years however this study has been criticized by those who support the young canyon age of around six million years as an attempt to push the interpretation of their new data to their limits without consideration of the whole range of other geologic data sets the canyon is the result of erosion which exposes one of the most complete geologic columns on the planet the major geologic exposures in the grand canyon range in age from the 2-billion-year-old vishnu schist at the bottom of the inner gorge to the 230-million-year-old kaibab limestone on the rim there is a gap of about a billion years between the 500-million-year-old stratum and the level below it which dates to about 15 billion years ago this large unconformity indicates a long period for which no deposits are present many of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas near-shore environments such as beaches and swamps as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-north america major exceptions include the permian coconino sandstone which contains abundant geological evidence of aeolian sand dune deposition several parts of the supai group also were deposited in nonmarine environments the great depth of the grand canyon and especially the height of its strata most of which formed below sea level can be attributed to 510 thousand feet 1500 to 3000m of uplift of the colorado plateau starting about 65 million years ago during the laramide orogeny this uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the colorado river and its tributaries which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock see the elevation summary of the colorado river for present conditions weather conditions during the ice ages also increased the amount of water in the colorado river drainage system the ancestral colorado river responded by cutting its channel faster and deeper the base level and course of the colorado river or its ancestral equivalent changed 53 million years ago when the gulf of california opened and lowered the rivers base level its lowest point this increased the rate of erosion and cut nearly all of the grand canyons current depth by 12 million years ago the terraced walls of the canyon were created by differential erosion between 100000 and 3 million years ago volcanic activity deposited ash and lava over the area which at times completely obstructed the river these volcanic rocks are the youngest in the canyon history native americans the ancestral puebloans were a native american culture centered on the present-day four corners area of the united states they were the first people known to live in the grand canyon area the cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the anasazi although the term is not preferred by the modern puebloan peoples the word anasazi is navajo for ancient ones or ancient enemy archaeologists still debate when this distinct culture emerged the current consensus based on terminology defined by the pecos classification suggests their emergence was around 1200bce during the basketmaker ii era beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations researchers have believed that the ancient puebloans are ancestors of the modern pueblo peoples in addition to the ancestral puebloans a number of distinct cultures have inhabited the grand canyon area the cohonina lived to the west of the grand canyon between 500 and 1200ce the cohonina were ancestors of the yuman havasupai and hualapai peoples who inhabit the area today the sinagua were a cultural group occupying an area to the southeast of the grand canyon between the little colorado river and the salt river between approximately 500 and 1425 ce the sinagua may have been ancestors of several hopi clans by the time of the arrival of europeans in the 16thcentury newer cultures had evolved the hualapai inhabit a 100-mile 160km stretch along the pine-clad southern side of the grand canyon the havasupai have been living in the area near cataract canyon since the beginning of the 13thcentury occupying an area the size of delaware the southern paiutes live in what is now southern utah and northern arizona the navajo or din live in a wide area stretching from the san francisco peaks eastwards towards the four corners archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests the navajo descended from the athabaskan people near great slave lake canada who migrated after the 11thcentury european arrival and settlement spanish explorers in september 1540 under orders from the conquistador francisco vzquez de coronado to search for the fabled seven cities of cibola captain garca lpez de crdenas along with hopi guides and a small group of spanish soldiers traveled to the south rim of the grand canyon between desert view and moran point pablo de melgrossa juan galeras and a third soldier descended some one third of the way into the canyon until they were forced to return because of lack of water in their report they noted that some of the rocks in the canyon were bigger than the great tower of seville giralda it is speculated that their hopi guides likely knew routes to the canyon floor but may have been reluctant to lead the spanish to the river no europeans visited the canyon again for more than two hundred years fathers francisco atanasio domnguez and silvestre vlez de escalante were two spanish priests who with a group of spanish soldiers explored southern utah and traveled along the north rim of the canyon in glen and marble canyons in search of a route from santa fe to california in 1776 they eventually found a crossing formerly known as the crossing of the fathers that today lies under lake powell also in 1776 fray francisco garces a franciscan missionary spent a week near havasupai unsuccessfully attempting to convert a band of native americans to christianity he described the canyon as profound american exploration james ohio pattie along with a group of american trappers and mountain men may have been the next european to reach the canyon in 1826 jacob hamblin a mormon missionary was sent by brigham young in the 1850s to locate suitable river crossing sites in the canyon building good relations with local hualapai and white settlers he found the crossing of the fathers and the locations what would become lees ferry in 1858 and pearce ferry later operated by and named for harrison pearce only the latter two sites suitable for ferry operation he also acted as an advisor to john wesley powell before his second expedition to the grand canyon serving as a diplomat between powell and the local native tribes to ensure the safety of his party in 1857 edward fitzgerald beale was superintendent of an expedition to survey a wagon road along the 35th parallel from fort defiance arizona to the colorado river he led a small party of men in search of water on the coconino plateau near the canyons south rim on september 19 near present-day national canyon they came upon what may humphreys stacey described in his journal as a wonderful canyon four thousand feet deep everyone in the party admitted that he never before saw anything to match or equal this astonishing natural curiosity also in 1857 the us war department asked lieutenant joseph ives to lead an expedition to assess the feasibility of an up-river navigation from the gulf of california also in a stern wheeler steamboat explorer after two months and 350 miles 560km of difficult navigation his party reached black canyon some two months after george johnson the explorer struck a rock and was abandoned ives led his party east into the canyon they may have been the first europeans to travel the diamond creek drainage and traveled eastwards along the south rim in his colorado river of the west report to the senate in 1861 he states that one or two trappers profess to have seen the canyon according to the san francisco herald in a series of articles run in 1853 captain joseph r walker in january 1851 with his nephew james t walker and six men traveled up the colorado river to a point where it joined the virgin river and continued east into arizona traveling along the grand canyon and making short exploratory side trips along the way walker is reported to have said he wanted to visit the moqui indians as the hopi were then called by whites he had met these people briefly in previous years thought them exceptionally interesting and wanted to become better acquainted the herald reporter then stated we believe that captain joe walker is the only white man in this country that has ever visited this strange people in 1858 john strong newberry became probably the first geologist to visit the grand canyon in 1869 major john wesley powell led the first expedition down the canyon powell set out to explore the colorado river and the grand canyon gathering nine men four boats and food for 10months he set out from green river wyoming on may 24 passing through or portaging around a series of dangerous rapids the group passed down the green river to its confluence with the colorado river near present-day moab utah and completed the journey with many hardships through the grand canyon on august 13 1869 in 1871 powell first used the term grand canyon previously it had been called the big canyon in 1889 frank m brown wanted to build a railroad along the colorado river to carry coal he his chief engineer robert brewster stanton and 14 others started to explore the grand canyon in poorly designed cedar wood boats with no life preservers brown drowned in an accident near marble canyon stanton made new boats and proceeded to explore the colorado all of the way to the gulf of california the grand canyon became an official

protection national monument and park us president theodore roosevelt visited the grand canyon in 1903 an avid outdoorsman and staunch conservationist roosevelt established the grand canyon game preserve on november 28 1906 livestock grazing was reduced but predators such as mountain lions eagles and wolves were eradicated roosevelt along with other members of his conservation group the boone and crockett club helped form the national parks association which in turn lobbied for the antiquities act of 1906 which gave roosevelt the power to create national monuments once the act was passed roosevelt immediately added adjacent national forest lands and redesignated the preserve a us national monument on january 11 1908 opponents such as land and mining claim holders blocked efforts to reclassify the monument as a us national park for 11 years grand canyon national park was finally established as the 17th us national park by an act of congress signed into law by president woodrow wilson on february 26 1919 the federal government administrators who manage park resources face many challenges these include issues related to the recent reintroduction into the wild of the highly endangered california condor air tour overflight noise levels water rights disputes with various tribal reservations that border the park and forest fire management federal officials started a flood in the grand canyon in hopes of restoring its ecosystem on march 5 2008 the canyons ecosystem was permanently changed after the construction of the glen canyon dam in 1963 between 2003 and 2011 2215 mining claims had been requested that are adjacent to the canyon including claims for uranium mines mining has been suspended since 2009 when us interior secretary ken salazar withdrew 1million acres 4000km from the permitting process pending assessment of the environmental impact of mining critics of the mines are concerned that once mined the uranium will leach into the water of the colorado river and contaminate the water supply for up to 18 million people salazars so-called northern arizona withdrawal is a 20-year moratorium on new mines but allows existing mines to continue in 2012 the federal government stopped new mines in the area which was upheld by the us district court for arizona in 2014 but appealed by the national mining association joined by the state of arizona under attorney general mark brnovich as well as utah montana and nevada national mining association v jewell is pending before the ninth circuit court of appeals as of september 2015 south rim buildings there are several historic buildings located along the south rim with most in the vicinity of grand canyon village buckey oneill cabin was built during the 1890s by william owen buckey oneill he built the cabin because of a copper deposit that was nearby he had several occupations such as miner judge politician author and tour guide this cabin is the longest continually standing structure on the south rim it is currently used as a guest house booking is required well in advance kolb studio was built in 1904 by brothers ellsworth and emery kolb they were photographers who made a living by photographing visitors walking down the bright angel trail in 1911 the kolb brothers filmed their journey down the green and colorado rivers emery kolb showed this movie regularly in his studio until 1976 when he died at the age of 95 today the building serves as an art gallery and exhibit the el tovar hotel was built in 1905 and is the most luxurious lodging on the south rim the hotel consists of 4 stories with a rustic chalet appearance called national park rustic it was designed by charles whittlesley a gift shop and restaurant are located inside the hotel hopi house was built by mary jane colter in 1905 it is based on structures that were built in an ancient hopi settlement called old oraibi located on the third mesa in eastern arizona it served as a residence for the hopi indians who sold arts and crafts to south rim visitors verkamps curios which stands next to the hopi house was built by john verkamp in 1905 he sold arts and crafts as well as souvenirs until september 2008 it was run by his descendants in november 2008 the building reopened as a visitor center focusing on the history of the grand canyon village community grand canyon railway depot was completed in 1910 and contains 2 levels gordon chappell regional historian for the park service claims that this depot building is one of only three log-cabin-style train stations currently standing out of fourteen ever built in the us the depot is the northern terminus of the grand canyon railway which begins in williams arizona lookout studio another mary colter design was built in 1914 photography artwork books souvenirs and rock and fossil specimens are sold here a great view of bright angel trail can be seen here desert view watchtower one of mary colters best-known works was built in 1932 situated at the far eastern end of the south rim 27 miles 43km from grand canyon village the tower stands 70 feet 21m tall the top of the tower is 7522 feet 2293m above sea level the highest point on the south rim it offers one of the few full views of the bottom of the canyon and the colorado river it was designed to mimic ancestral puebloans watchtowers though with four levels it is significantly taller than historical towers bright angel lodge was built of logs and stone in 1935 mary colter designed the lodge and it was built by the fred harvey company inside the lodge is a small museum honoring fred harvey june 27 1835 february 9 1901 who played a major role in popularizing the grand canyon in the history room is a stone fireplace layered in the same sequence as those in the canyon weather weather in the grand canyon varies according to elevation the forested rims are high enough to receive winter snowfall but along the colorado river in the inner gorge temperatures are similar to those found in tucson and other low elevation desert locations in arizona conditions in the grand canyon region are generally dry but substantial precipitation occurs twice annually during seasonal pattern shifts in winter when pacific storms usually deliver widespread moderate rain and high-elevation snow to the region from the west and in late summer due to the north american monsoon which delivers waves of moisture from the southeast causing dramatic localized thunderstorms fueled by the heat of the day average annual precipitation on the south rim is less than 16 inches 41cm with 60 inches 150cm of snow the higher north rim usually receives 27 inches 69cm of moisture with a typical snowfall of 144 inches 370cm and phantom ranch far below the canyons rims along the colorado river at 2500 feet 762m gets just 8 inches 20cm of rain and snow is a rarity temperatures vary wildly throughout the year with summer highs within the inner gorge commonly exceeding 100f 378c and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below zero degrees fahrenheit 178c along the canyons rims visitors are often surprised by these potentially extreme conditions and this along with the high altitude of the canyons rims can lead to unpleasant side effects such as dehydration sunburn and hypothermia weather conditions can greatly affect hiking and canyon exploration and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures winter storms and late summer monsoons while the park service posts weather information at gates and visitor centers this is a rough approximation only and should not be relied upon for trip planning for accurate weather in the canyon hikers should consult the national weather services noaa weather radio or the official national weather service website the national weather service has had a cooperative station on the south rim since 1903 the record high temperature on the south rim was 105f 41c on june 26 1974 and the record low temperature was 20f 29c on january 1 1919 february 1 1985 and december 23 1990 air quality the grand canyon area has some of the cleanest air in the united states however at times the air quality can be considerably affected by events such as forest fires and dust storms in the southwest what effect there is on air quality and visibility in the canyon has been mainly from sulfates soils and organics the sulfates largely result from urban emissions in southern california borne on the prevailing westerly winds throughout much of the year and emissions from arizonas copper smelter region borne on southerly or southeasterly winds during the monsoon airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust organic particles result from vehicle emissions long-range transport from urban areas and forest fires as well as from vocs emitted by vegetation in the surrounding forests nitrates carried in from urban areas stationary sources and vehicle emissions as well as black carbon from forest fires and vehicle emissions also contribute to a lesser extent a number of actions have been taken to preserve and further improve air quality and visibility at the canyon in 1990 amendments to the clean air act established the grand canyon visibility transport commission gcvtc to advise the us epa on strategies for protecting visual air quality on the colorado plateau the gcvtc released its final report in 1996 and initiated the western regional air partnership wrap a partnership of state tribal and federal agencies to help coordinate implementation of the commissions recommendations in 1999 the regional haze rule established a goal of restoring visibility in national parks and wilderness areas class 1 areas such as the grand canyon to natural background levels by 2064 subsequent revisions to the rule provide specific requirements for making reasonable progress toward that goal in the early 1990s studies indicated that emissions of so2 a sulfate precursor from the navajo generating station affected visibility in the canyon mainly in the winter and which if controlled would improve wintertime visibility by 2 to 7 as a result scrubbers were added to the plants three units in 1997 through 1999 reducing so2 emissions by more than 90 the plant also installed low-nox sofa burners in 2009 -2011 reducing emissions of nox a nitrate precursor by 40 emissions from the mohave generating station to the west were similarly found to affect visibility in the canyon the plant was required to have installed so2 scrubbers but was instead shut down in 2005 completely eliminating its emissions prescribed fires are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions although prescribed fires also affect air quality the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact biology and ecology plants there are approximately 1737 known species of vascular plants 167 species of fungi 64 species of moss and 195 species of lichen found in grand canyon national park this variety is largely due to the 8000 foot 2400m elevation change from the colorado river up to the highest point on the north rim grand canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants known only within the parks boundaries while only ten percent of the parks flora is exotic sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the us fish and wildlife service the mojave desert influences the western sections of the canyon sonoran desert vegetation covers the eastern sections and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims natural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11 of all the plant species found in the grand canyon the canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length the canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species like the tassel-eared squirrel the aspect or direction a slope faces also plays a major role in adding diversity to the grand canyon north-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations or in more northern latitudes the south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the sonoran desert animals of the 90 mammal species found along the colorado river corridor 18 are rodents and 22 are bats life zones and communities the park contains several major ecosystems its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in north america the five life zones represented are the lower sonoran upper sonoran transition canadian and hudsonian this is equivalent to traveling from mexico to canada differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon grand canyon national park contains 129 vegetation communities and the composition and distribution of plant species is influenced by climate geomorphology and geology lower sonoran the lower sonoran life zone spans from the colorado river up to 3500 feet 1100m along the colorado river and its perennial tributaries a riparian community exists coyote willow arrowweed seep-willow western honey mesquite catclaw acacia and exotic tamarisk saltcedar are the predominant species hanging gardens seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western redbud stream orchid and flaveria mcdougallii endangered fish in the river include the humpback chub and the razorback sucker the three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the canyon tree frog red-spotted toad and woodhouses rocky mountain toad leopard frogs are very rare in the colorado river corridor they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the canyon in several years there are 33 crustacean species found in the colorado river and its tributaries within grand canyon national park of these 33 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms only 48 bird species regularly nest along the river while others use the river as a migration corridor or as overwintering habitat the bald eagle is one species that uses the river corridor as winter habitat river otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century and muskrats are extremely rare beavers cut willows cottonwoods and shrubs for food and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation other rodents such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice are mostly omnivorous using many different vegetation types grand canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries in addition to bats coyotes ringtails and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates rodents and reptiles raccoons weasels bobcats gray foxes and mountain lions are also present but are much more rare mule deer and desert bighorn sheep are the ungulates that frequent the river corridor since the removal of 500 feral burros in the early 1980s bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce the insect species commonly found in the river corridor and tributaries are midges caddis flies mayflies stoneflies black flies mites beetles butterflies moths and fire ants numerous species of spiders and several species of scorpions including the bark scorpion and the giant desert hairy scorpion inhabit the riparian zone eleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of mollusks have been identified in and around grand canyon national park of the aquatic species two are bivalves clams and nine are gastropods snails twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified primarily land snails and slugs there are approximately 41 reptile species in grand canyon national park ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes lizard density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the waters edge and the beginning of the upland desert community the two largest lizards in the canyon are gila monsters and chuckwallas many snake species which are not directly dependent on surface water may be found both within the inner gorge and the colorado river corridor six rattlesnake species have been recorded in the park above the river corridor a desert scrub community composed of north american desert flora thrives typical warm desert species such as creosote bush white bursage brittlebush catclaw acacia ocotillo mariola western honey mesquite four-wing saltbush big sagebrush blackbrush and rubber rabbitbrush grow in this community the mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species mostly rodents and bats three of the five park woodrat species live in the desert scrub community except for the western desert banded gecko which seems to be distributed only near water along the colorado river all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands but in lower densities the desert gopher tortoise a threatened species inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park some of the common insects found at elevations above 2000 feet 610m are orange paper wasps honey bees black flies tarantula hawks stink bugs beetles black ants and monarch and swallowtail butterflies solifugids wood spiders garden spiders black widow spiders and tarantulas can be found in the desert scrub and higher elevations upper sonoran and transition the upper sonoran life zone includes most of the inner canyon and south rim at elevations from 3500 to 7000 feet 1100 to 2100m this zone is generally dominated by blackbrush sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodlands elevations of 3500 to 4000 feet 1100 to 1200m are in the mojave desert scrub community of the upper sonoran this community is dominated by the four-winged saltbush and creosote bush other important plants include utah agave narrowleaf mesquite ratany catclaw acacia and various cacti species approximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the sonoran and mohave deserts the abundance of bats swifts and riparian birds provides ample food for peregrines and suitable eyrie sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls also several critically endangered california condors that were re-introduced to the colorado plateau on the arizona strip have made the eastern part of the park their home the conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species porcupines shrews red squirrels tassel eared kaibab and aberts squirrels black bear mule deer and elk are found at the parks higher elevations on the kaibab plateau above the desert scrub and up to 6200 feet 1900m is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland within this woodland one can find big sagebrush snakeweed mormon tea utah agave banana and narrowleaf yucca winterfat indian ricegrass dropseed and needlegrass there are a variety of snakes and lizards here but one species of reptile the mountain short-horned lizard is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the pion-juniper and ponderosa pine forests ponderosa pine forests grow at elevations between 6500 and 8200 feet 2000 and 2500m on both north and south rims in the transition life zone the south rim includes species such as gray fox mule deer bighorn sheep rock squirrels pinyon pine and utah juniper additional species such as gambel oak new mexico locust mountain mahogany elderberry creeping mahonia and fescue have been identified in these forests the utah tiger salamander and the great basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants canadian and hudsonian elevations of 8200 to 9000 feet 2500 to 2700m are in the canadian life zone which includes the north rim and the kaibab plateau spruce-fir forests characterized by engelmann spruce blue spruce douglas fir white fir aspen and mountain ash along with several species of perennial grasses groundsels yarrow cinquefoil lupines sedges and asters grow in this sub-alpine climate mountain lions kaibab squirrels and northern goshawks are found here montane meadows and subalpine grassland communities of the hudsonian life zone are rare and located only on the north rim both are typified by many grass species some of these grasses include blue and black grama big galleta indian ricegrass and three-awns the wettest areas support sedges and forbs grand canyon tourism grand canyon national park is one of the worlds premier natural attractions attracting about five million visitors per year overall 83 were from the united states california 12 arizona 9 texas 5 florida 3 and new york 3 represented the top domestic visitors seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the united states the most prominently represented nations were the united kingdom 4 canada 4 japan 2 germany 2 and the netherlands 1 the south rim is open all year round weather permitting the north rim is generally open mid-may to mid-october activities aside from casual sightseeing from the south rim averaging 7000 feet 2100m above sea level rafting hiking running and helicopter tours are popular the grand canyon ultra marathon is a 78-mile 126km race over 24 hours the floor of the valley is accessible by foot muleback or by boat or raft from upriver hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance steep and rocky trails change in elevation and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers nevertheless hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year camping on the north and south rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended especially at the busier south rim there is at large camping available along many parts of the north rim managed by kaibab national forest north rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack all overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the backcountry office bco each year grand canyon national park receives approximately 30000 requests for backcountry permits the park issues 13000 permits and close to 40000 people camp overnight the earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month four months before the proposed start month tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving board helicopters and small airplanes in boulder las vegas phoenix and grand canyon national park airport seven miles from the south rim for canyon flyovers scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1500feet of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash the last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984 however some helicopter flights land on the havasupai and hualapai indian reservations within grand canyon outside of the park boundaries in 2007 the hualapai tribe opened the glass-bottomed grand canyon skywalk on their property grand canyon west the skywalk is about 250 miles 400km by road from grand canyon village at the south rim the skywalk has attracted thousands of visitors a year most from las vegas in 2016 skydiving at the grand canyon become possible with the first grand canyon skydiving operation opening up at the grand canyon national park airport on the south rim in 2014 a developer announced plans to build a
