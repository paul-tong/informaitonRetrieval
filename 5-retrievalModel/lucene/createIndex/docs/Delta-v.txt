delta-v literally change in velocity symbolised as v and pronounced delta-vee as used in spacecraft flight dynamics is a measure of the impulse that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launch from or landing on a planet or moon or in-space orbital maneuver it is a scalar that has the units of speed as used in this context it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle as a simple example take a conventional rocket which achieves thrust by burning fuel delta-v is the change in velocity that can be achieved by burning that rockets entire fuel load delta-v is produced by reaction engines such as rocket engines and is proportional to the thrust per unit mass and the burn time it is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given maneuver through the tsiolkovsky rocket equation for multiple maneuvers delta-v sums linearly for interplanetary missions delta-v is often plotted on a porkchop plot which displays the required mission delta-v as a function of launch date definition where specific cases in the absence of external forces where v displaystyle dot v is the coordinate acceleration when thrust is applied in a constant direction vv is constant this simplifies to which is simply the magnitude of the change in velocity however this relation does not hold in the general case if for instance a constant unidirectional acceleration is reversed after t1t02 then the velocity difference is 0 but delta-v is the same as for the non-reversed thrust for rockets the absence of external forces is taken to mean the absence of gravity atmospheric drag as well as the absence of aerostatic back pressure on the nozzle and hence the vacuum isp is used for calculating the vehicles delta-v capacity via the rocket equation in addition the costs for atmospheric losses and gravity drag are added into the delta-v budget when dealing with launches from a planetary surface orbital maneuvers orbit maneuvers are made by firing a thruster to produce a reaction force acting on the spacecraft the size of this force will be where the acceleration v displaystyle dot v of the spacecraft caused by this force will be where m is the mass of the spacecraft during the burn the mass of the spacecraft will decrease due to use of fuel the time derivative of the mass being if now the direction of the force ie the direction of the nozzle is fixed during the burn one gets the velocity increase from the thruster force of a burn starting at time t 0 displaystyle t0 and ending at t1 as changing the integration variable from time t to the spacecraft mass m one gets assuming v exh displaystyle vtextexh to be a constant not depending on the amount of fuel left this relation is integrated to which is the tsiolkovsky rocket equation if for example 20 of the launch mass is fuel giving a constant v exh displaystyle vtextexh of 2100ms a typical value for a hydrazine thruster the capacity of the reaction control system is if v exh displaystyle vtextexh is a non-constant function of the amount of fuel left the capacity of the reaction control system is computed by the integral 5 the acceleration 2 caused by the thruster force is just an additional acceleration to be added to the other accelerations force per unit mass affecting the spacecraft and the orbit can easily be propagated with a numerical algorithm including also this thruster force but for many purposes typically for studies or for maneuver optimization they are approximated by impulsive maneuvers as illustrated in figure 1 with a v displaystyle delta v as given by 4 like this one can for example use a patched conics approach modeling the maneuver as a shift from one kepler orbit to another by an instantaneous change of the velocity vector this approximation with impulsive maneuvers is in most cases very accurate at least when chemical propulsion is used for low thrust systems typically electrical propulsion systems this approximation is less accurate but even for geostationary spacecraft using electrical propulsion for out-of-plane control with thruster burn periods extending over several hours around the nodes this approximation is fair production delta-v is typically provided by the thrust of a rocket engine but can be created by other engines the time-rate of change of delta-v is the magnitude of the acceleration caused by the engines ie the thrust per total vehicle mass the actual acceleration vector would be found by adding thrust per mass on to the gravity vector and the vectors representing any other forces acting on the object the total delta-v needed is a good starting point for early design decisions since consideration of the added complexities are deferred to later times in the design process the rocket equation shows that the required amount of propellant dramatically increases with increasing delta-v therefore in modern spacecraft propulsion systems considerable study is put into reducing the total delta-v needed for a given spaceflight as well as designing spacecraft that are capable of producing larger delta-v increasing the delta-v provided by a propulsion system can be achieved by staging increasing specific impulse improving propellant mass fraction multiple maneuvers because the mass ratios apply to any given burn when multiple maneuvers are performed in sequence the mass ratios multiply thus it can be shown that provided the exhaust velocity is fixed this means that delta-v can be summed when m1 m2 are the mass ratios of the maneuvers and v1 v2 are the delta-v of the first and second maneuvers m 1 m 2 e v 1 v e e v 2 v e e v 1 v 2 v e e v v e m displaystyle beginalignedm1m2efrac v1veefrac v2veefrac v1v2veefrac vvemendaligned where v v1 v2 and m m1 m2 which is just the rocket equation applied to the sum of the two maneuvers this is convenient since it means that delta-v can be calculated and simply added and the mass ratio calculated only for the overall vehicle for the entire mission thus delta-v is commonly quoted rather than mass ratios which would require multiplication delta-v budgets when designing a trajectory delta-v budget is used as a good indicator of how much propellant will be required propellant usage is an exponential function of delta-v in accordance with the rocket equation it will also depend on the exhaust velocity it is not possible to determine delta-v requirements from conservation of energy by considering only the total energy of the vehicle in the initial and final orbits since energy is carried away in the exhaust see also below for example most spacecraft are launched in an orbit with inclination fairly near to the latitude at the launch site to take advantage of the earths rotational surface speed if it is necessary for mission-based reasons to put the spacecraft in an orbit of different inclination a substantial delta-v is required though the specific kinetic and potential energies in the final orbit and the initial orbit are equal when rocket thrust is applied in short bursts the other sources of acceleration may be negligible and the magnitude of the velocity change of one burst may be simply approximated by the delta-v the total delta-v to be applied can then simply be found by addition of each of the delta-vs needed at the discrete burns even though between bursts the magnitude and direction of the velocity changes due to gravity eg in an elliptic orbit for examples of calculating delta-v see hohmann transfer orbit gravitational slingshot and interplanetary transport network it is also notable that large thrust can reduce gravity drag delta-v is also required to keep satellites in orbit and is expended in propulsive orbital stationkeeping maneuvers since the propellant load on most satellites cannot be replenished the amount of propellant initially loaded on a satellite may well determine its useful lifetime oberth effect from power considerations it turns out that when applying delta-v in the direction of the velocity the specific orbital energy gained per unit delta-v is equal to the instantaneous speed this is called the oberth effect for example a satellite in an elliptical orbit is boosted more efficiently at high speed that is small altitude than at low speed that is high altitude another example is that when a vehicle is making a pass of a planet burning the propellant at closest approach rather than further out gives significantly higher final speed and this is even more so when the planet is a large one with a deep gravity field such as jupiter see also powered slingshots porkchop plot due to the relative positions of planets changing over time different delta-vs are required at different launch dates a diagram that shows the required delta-v plotted against time is sometimes called a porkchop plot such a diagram is useful since it enables calculation of a launch window since launch should only occur when the mission is within the capabilities of the vehicle to be employed around the solar system delta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets red arrows show where optional aerobraking can be performed in that particular direction black numbers give delta-v in kms that apply in either direction lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer see fuzzy orbital transfers the figure 25 for leo to gto is higher than necessary and the figure of 30 for leo to the sun is also too high see also delta-v budget gravity drag
