c eo french from khmer o keo glass canal is an archaeological site in thoi sn district in southern an giang province vietnam in the mekong river delta c eo may have been a busy port of the kingdom of funan between the 1st and 7th centuries scholars use the term c eo culture to refer to the archaeological culture of the mekong delta region that is typified by the artifacts recovered at c eo through archeological investigation c eo is also one of the modern day communes of vietnam archaeological site excavation at c eo began on february 10 1942 after french archaeologists had discovered the site through the use of aerial photography the first excavations were led by louis malleret the site covers 450 ha c eo is situated within a network of ancient canals that crisscross the low flatland of the mekong delta one of the canals connects c eo to the towns seaport while another goes 68 kilometres 42mi north-northeast to angkor borei c eo is longitudinally bisected by a canal and there are four transverse canals along which pile-supported houses were perhaps ranged archaeological sites reflecting the material culture of c eo are spread throughout southern vietnam but are most heavily concentrated in the area of the mekong delta to the south and west of ho chi minh city the most significant site aside from c eo itself is at thp mui north of the tien giang river where among other remains a stele with a 6th-century sanskrit text has been discovered aerial photography in 1958 revealed that during the funan period a distributary of the mekong entered the gulf of thailand in the vicinity of ta keo which was then on the shore but since then become separated by some distance from the sea as a result of siltation at that time ta keo was connected by a canal with oc eo allowing it access to the gulf the distributary of the mekong revealed in the aerial photography was probably the saenus mentioned in ptolemys geography as the western branch of the mekong which ptolemy called the cottiaris the cattigara in ptolemys geography could be derived from a sanskrit word either kottinagara strong city or kirtinagara renowned city remains the remains found at c eo include pottery tools jewelry casts for making jewelry coins and religious statues among the finds are gold jewellery imitating coins from the roman empire of the antonine period roman golden medallions from the reign of antoninus pius and possibly his successor marcus aurelius have been discovered at c eo which was near chinese-controlled jiaozhou and the region where chinese historical texts claim the romans first landed before venturing further into china to conduct diplomacy in 166 many of the remains have been collected and are on exhibition in museum of vietnamese history in ho chi minh city among the coins found at c eo by malleret were eight made of silver bearing the image of the hamsa or crested argus apparently minted in funan c eo and funan c eo has been regarded as belonging to the historical kingdom of funan that flourished in the mekong delta between the 1st and the 6th century ce the kingdom of funan is known to us from the works of ancient chinese historians especially writers of dynastic histories who in turn drew from the testimony of chinese diplomats and travellers and of foreign including funanese embassies to the chinese imperial courts indeed the name funan itself is an artifact of the chinese histories and does not appear in the paleographic record of ancient vietnam or cambodia from the chinese sources however it can be determined that a polity called funan by the chinese was the dominant polity located in the mekong delta region as a result archeological discoveries in that region that can be dated to the period of funan have been identified with the historical polity of funan the discoveries at c eo and related sites are our primary source for the material culture of funan the vietnamese archaeologist and historian h vn tn has written that at the present stage of knowledge it was impossible to demonstrate the existence of a funan culture widely spread from the mekong delta through the chao praya delta to burma with oc eo as the typical representative the presence of similar artefacts such as jewelry and seals from sites in those areas was simply the result of trade and exchange while each of the sites bore the signs of their own separate cultural development he supported the view of claude jacques that in view of the complete lack of any khmer records relating to a kingdom by the name of funan use of this name should be abandoned in favour of the names such as aninditapura bhavapura shresthapura and vyadhapura which are known from inscriptions to have been used at the time for cities in the region and provide a more accurate idea of the true geography of the ancient khmer territory h vn tn argued that from the late neolithic or early metal age c eo gradually emerged as an economic and cultural centre of the mekong delta and with an important position on the southeast asian sea routes became a meeting place for craftsmen and traders which provided adequate conditions for urbanization receiving foreign influences notably from india which in turn stimulated internal development funan was part of the region of southeast asia referred to in ancient indian texts as suvarnabhumi and may have been the part to which the term was first applied kattigara of ptolemy c eo may have been the port known to the romans as kattigara kattigara was the name given by the 2nd-century alexandrian geographer claudius ptolemy to the land on the easternmost shore of the indian sea at due to a scribal error 8 south of the equator the name kattigara was probably derived from the sanskrit kirti-nagara - renowned city or kotti-nagara - strong city scholarship has now determined that ptolemys kattigara was at 8 north of the equator and was the forerunner of saigon as the main port and entrepot at the mouth of the mekong john caverhill deduced in 1767 that cattigara was the mekong delta port banteaymeas now h tin not far from c eo the plea in 1979 by jeremy hcs davidson for a thorough study of h-tin in its historical context and in relation to c-eo as indispensable for accurate understanding and interpretation of the site still remains unanswered the eighteenth-century french geographer jean-baptiste bourguignon danville located cattigara at the mouth of the mekong cottiaris river where it is shown on his map orbis veteribus notus the world known to the ancients the swedish yachtsman and writer bjorn landstrm also concluded from the sailing directions given by the ancient merchant and seafarer alexander that cattigara lay at the mouth of the mekong the father of early southeast asian history george coeds has said by the middle of the 3rd century fu-nan had already established relations with china and india and it is doubtless on the west coast of the gulf of siam that the furthest point reached by hellenistic navigators is to be found that is the harbour of kattigara mentioned by ptolemy ah christie said in 1979 that the presence of objects however few in number from the roman orient added some weight to the conjecture that c-eo was the ptolemaic kattigara the distinguished german classical scholar albrecht dihle supported this view saying from the account of the voyage of alexander referred to by ptolemy kattigara can actually be located only in the mekong delta because alexander went first along the east coast of the malacca peninsula northward to bangkok from thence likewise only along the coast toward the south east and so came to kattigara we hear nothing of any further change of course in addition at oc eo an emporium excavated in the western mekong delta in the ancient kingdom of fu-nan roman finds from the 2nd century after christ have come to light columbus search for ciamba guided by ptolemy the discoverers of the new world were initially trying to find their way to kattigara on the 1489 map of the world made by henricus martellus germanus revising ptolemys work asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape the cape of cattigara writing of his 1499 voyage amerigo vespucci said he had hoped to reach malacca melaka by sailing westward from spain across the western ocean the atlantic around the cape of cattigara into the sinus magnus great gulf that lay to the east of the golden chersonese malay peninsula of which the cape of cattigara formed the southeastern point the sinus magnus was the actual gulf of thailand christopher columbus on his fourth and last voyage of 15021503 planned to follow the coast of champa southward around the cape of cattigara and sail through the strait separating cattigara from the new world into the sinus magnus to malacca this was the route he thought marco polo had gone from china to india in 1292 columbus planned to meet up with the expedition sent at the same time from portugal around the cape of good hope under vasco da gama and carried letters of credence from the spanish monarchs to present to da gama on reaching cariay on the coast of costa rica columbus thought he was close to the gold mines of champa on july 7 1503 he wrote from jamaica i reached the land of cariayhere i received news of the gold mines of ciamba champa which i was seeking sources albert
