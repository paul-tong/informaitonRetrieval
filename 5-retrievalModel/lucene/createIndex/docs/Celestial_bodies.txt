an astronomical object or celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity association or structure that exists in the observable universe in astronomy the terms object and body are often used interchangeably however an astronomical body or celestial body is a single tightly bound contiguous entity while an astronomical or celestial object is a complex less cohesively bound structure which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures examples of astronomical objects include planetary systems star clusters nebulae and galaxies while asteroids moons planets and stars are astronomical bodies a comet may be identified as both body and object it is a body when referring to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust and an object when describing the entire comet with its diffuse coma and tail galaxy and larger the universe can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure at the largest scales the fundamental component of assembly is the galaxy galaxies are organized into groups and clusters often within larger superclusters that are strung along great filaments between nearly empty voids forming a web that spans the observable universe the universe has a variety of morphologies with irregular elliptical and disk-like shapes depending on their formation and evolutionary histories including interaction with other galaxies which may lead to a merger disc galaxies encompass lenticular and spiral galaxies with features such as spiral arms and a distinct halo at the core most galaxies have a supermassive black hole which may result in an active galactic nucleus galaxies can also have satellites in the form of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters within a galaxy the constituents of a galaxy are formed out of gaseous matter that assembles through gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner at this level the resulting fundamental components are the stars which are typically assembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae the great variety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass composition and evolutionary state of these stars stars may be found in multi-star systems that orbit about each other in a hierarchical organization a planetary system and various minor objects such as asteroids comets and debris can form in a hierarchical process of accretion from the protoplanetary disks that surrounds newly formed stars the various distinctive types of stars are shown by the hertzsprungrussell diagram hr diagrama plot of absolute stellar luminosity versus surface temperature each star follows an evolutionary track across this diagram if this track takes the star through a region containing an intrinsic variable type then its physical properties can cause it to become a variable star an example of this is the instability strip a region of the h-r diagram that includes delta scuti rr lyrae and cepheid variables depending on the initial mass of the star and the presence or absence of a companion a star may spend the last part of its life as a compact object either a white dwarf neutron star or black hole categories by location the table below lists the general categories of bodies and objects by their location or structure see also astronomy portal list of light sources list of solar system objects list of solar system objects by size lists of astronomical objects skychart sky telescope at the library of congress web archives archived 2005-06-13 monthly skymaps for every location on earth
