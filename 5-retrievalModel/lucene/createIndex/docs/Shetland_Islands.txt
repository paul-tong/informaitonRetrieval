shetland scots shetland also called the shetland islands and formerly zetland is a subarctic archipelago of scotland that lies northeast of great britain the islands lie some 80km 50mi to the northeast of orkney 168km 104mi from the scottish mainland and 280km 170mi southeast of the faroe islands they form part of the division between the atlantic ocean to the west and the north sea to the east the total area is 1466km 566sqmi and the population totalled 23210 in 2011 comprising the shetland constituency of the scottish parliament shetland islands council is one of the 32 council areas of scotland the islands administrative centre and only burgh is lerwick which has also been the capital of shetland since taking over from scalloway in 1708 the largest island known as the mainland has an area of 967km 373sqmi making it the third-largest scottish island and the fifth-largest of the british isles there are an additional 15 inhabited islands the archipelago has an oceanic climate a complex geology a rugged coastline and many low rolling hills humans have lived in shetland since the mesolithic period the earliest written references to the islands date to roman times the early historic period was dominated by scandinavian influences especially from norway and the islands did not become part of scotland until the 15th century when scotland became part of the kingdom of great britain in 1707 trade with northern europe decreased fishing has continued to be an important aspect of the economy up to the present day the discovery of north sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted shetlands economy employment and public sector revenues the local way of life reflects the scottish and norse heritage of the isles including the up helly aa fire festival and a strong musical tradition especially the traditional fiddle style the islands have produced a variety of writers of prose and poetry often in the distinct shetland dialect of scots there are numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora including a number of important sea bird nesting sites the shetland pony and shetland sheepdog are two well-known shetland animal breeds other local breeds include the shetland sheep cow goose and duck the shetland pig or grice has been extinct since about 1930 the islands motto which appears on the councils coat of arms is me lgum skal land byggja the old norse original of this icelandic phrase is taken from the danish 1241 basic law code of jutland and is also mentioned in njls saga and means by law shall land be built etymology the name of shetland is derived from the old norse words hjalt hilt and land land in ad 43 and 77 the roman authors pomponius mela and pliny the elder referred to the seven islands they respectively called haemodae and acmodae both of which are assumed to be shetland another possible early written reference to the islands is tacitus report in agricola in ad 98 after describing the discovery and conquest of orkney that the roman fleet had seen thule too in early irish literature shetland is referred to as insi cattthe isles of cats which may have been the pre-norse inhabitants name for the islands the cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern scottish mainland and their name can be found in caithness and in the gaelic name for sutherland cataibh meaning among the cats the oldest version of the modern name shetland is hetlandensis the latinised adjectival form of the old norse name recorded in a letter from harald count of shetland in 1190 becoming hetland in 1431 after various intermediate transformations it is possible that the pictish cat sound forms part of this norse name it then became hjaltland in the 16th century as norn was gradually replaced by scots in the form of the shetland dialect hjaltland became etland the initial letter is the middle scots letter yogh the pronunciation of which is almost identical to the original norn sound hj when the use of the letter yogh was discontinued it was often replaced by the similar-looking letter z hence zetland the form used in the name of the pre-1975 county council this is also the source of the ze postcode used for shetland most of the individual islands have norse names although the derivations of some are obscure and may represent pre-norse possibly pictish or even pre-celtic names or elements geography and geology shetland is around 170 kilometres 110mi north of mainland scotland covers an area of 1468 square kilometres 567sqmi and has a coastline 2702 kilometres 1679mi long lerwick the capital and largest settlement has a population of 6958 and about half of the archipelagos total population of 23167 people live within 16 kilometres 10mi of the town scalloway on the west coast which was the capital until 1708 has a population of less than 1000 only 16 of about 100 islands are inhabited the main island of the group is known as mainland the next largest are yell unst and fetlar which lie to the north and bressay and whalsay which lie to the east east and west burra muckle roe papa stour trondra and vaila are smaller islands to the west of mainland the other inhabited islands are foula 28 kilometres 17mi west of walls fair isle 38 kilometres 24mi south-west of sumburgh head and the out skerries to the east the uninhabited islands include mousa known for the broch of mousa the finest preserved example in scotland of an iron age broch noss to the east of bressay which has been a national nature reserve since 1955 st ninians isle connected to mainland by the largest active tombolo in the uk and out stack the northernmost point of the british isles shetlands location means that it provides a number of such records muness is the most northerly castle in the united kingdom and skaw the most northerly settlement the geology of shetland is complex with numerous faults and fold axes these islands are the northern outpost of the caledonian orogeny and there are outcrops of lewisian dalradian and moine metamorphic rocks with histories similar to their equivalents on the scottish mainland there are also old red sandstone deposits and granite intrusions the most distinctive features are the ultrabasic ophiolite peridotite and gabbro on unst and fetlar which are remnants of the iapetus ocean floor much of shetlands economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas geological evidence shows that in around 6100 bc a tsunami caused by the storegga slides hit shetland as well as the rest of the east coast of scotland and may have created a wave of up to 25 metres 82ft high in the voes where modern populations are highest the highest point of shetland is ronas hill at 450 metres 1480ft the pleistocene glaciations entirely covered the islands during that period the stanes of stofast a 2000-tonne glacial erratic came to rest on a prominent hilltop in lunnasting shetland is a national scenic area which unusually includes a number of discrete locations fair isle foula south west mainland including the scalloway islands muckle roe esha ness fethaland and herma ness the total area covered by the designation is 41833ha of which 26347ha is marine ie below low tide in october 2018 legislation came into force in scotland to prevent public bodies without good reason showing shetland in a separate box in maps as had often been the practice the legislation requires the islands to be displayed in a manner that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of scotland so as make clear the islands real distance from other areas climate shetland has an oceanic temperate maritime climate kppen cfb bordering on but very slightly above average in summer temperatures the subpolar variety with long but cool winters and short mild summers the climate all year round is moderate owing to the influence of the surrounding seas with average night-time low temperatures a little above 1c 34f in january and february and average daytime high temperatures of near 14c 57f in july and august the highest temperature on record was 234c 741f in july 1991 and the lowest 89c 160f in the januaries of 1952 and 1959 the frost-free period may be as little as three months in contrast inland areas of nearby scandinavia on similar latitudes experience significantly larger temperature differences between summer and winter with the average highs of regular july days comparable to lerwicks all-time record heat that is around 23c 73f further demonstrating the moderating effect of the atlantic ocean in contrast winters are considerably milder than those expected in nearby continental areas even comparable to winter temperatures of many parts of england and wales much further south the general character of the climate is windy and cloudy with at least 2mm 008in of rain falling on more than 250 days a year average yearly precipitation is 1003mm 395in with november and december the wettest months snowfall is usually confined to the period november to february and snow seldom lies on the ground for more than a day less rain falls from april to august although no month receives less than 50mm 2in fog is common during summer due to the cooling effect of the sea on mild southerly airflows because of the islands latitude on clear winter nights the northern lights can sometimes be seen in the sky while in summer there is almost perpetual daylight a state of affairs known locally as the simmer dim annual bright sunshine averages 1110 hours and overcast days are common prehistory due to the practice dating to at least the early neolithic of building in stone on virtually treeless islands shetland is extremely rich in physical remains of the prehistoric eras and there are over 5000 archaeological sites all told a midden site at west voe on the south coast of mainland dated to 43204030 bc has provided the first evidence of mesolithic human activity on shetland the same site provides dates for early neolithic activity and finds at scord of brouster in walls have been dated to 3400 bc shetland knives are stone tools that date from this period made from felsite from northmavine pottery shards found at the important site of jarlshof also indicate that there was neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the bronze age this includes a smithy a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch the site has provided evidence of habitation during various phases right up until viking times heel-shaped cairns are a style of chambered cairn unique to shetland with a particularly large example on vementry numerous brochs were erected during the iron age in addition to mousa there are significant ruins at clickimin culswick old scatness and west burrafirth although their origin and purpose is a matter of some controversy the later iron age inhabitants of the northern isles were probably pictish although the historical record is sparse hunter 2000 states in relation to king bridei i of the picts in the sixth century ad as for shetland orkney skye and the western isles their inhabitants most of whom appear to have been pictish in culture and speech at this time are likely to have regarded bridei as a fairly distant presence in 2011 the collective site the crucible of iron age shetland including broch of mousa old scatness and jarlshof joined the uks tentative list of world heritage sites history scandinavian colonisation the expanding population of scandinavia led to a shortage of available resources and arable land there and led to a period of viking expansion the norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain modern shetlanders have almost identical proportions of scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure vikings then used the islands as a base for pirate expeditions to norway and the coasts of mainland scotland in response norwegian king harald hrfagre harald fair hair annexed the northern isles comprising orkney and shetland in 875 rognvald eysteinsson received orkney and shetland from harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in scotland and then passed the earldom on to his brother sigurd the mighty the islands converted to christianity in the late 10th century king olav tryggvasson summoned the jarl sigurd the stout during a visit to orkney and said i order you and all your subjects to be baptised if you refuse ill have you killed on the spot and i swear i will ravage every island with fire and steel unsurprisingly sigurd agreed and the islands became christian at a stroke unusually from c 1100 onwards the norse jarls owed allegiance both to norway and to the scottish crown through their holdings as earls of caithness in 1194 when harald maddadsson was earl of orkney and shetland a rebellion broke out against king sverre sigurdsson of norway the yskjeggs island beardies sailed for norway but were beaten in the battle of florvg near bergen after his victory king sverre placed shetland under direct norwegian rule a state of affairs that continued for nearly two centuries increased scottish interest from the mid-13th century onwards scottish monarchs increasingly sought to take control of the islands surrounding the mainland the process was begun in earnest by alexander ii and was continued by his successor alexander iii this strategy eventually led to an invasion of scotland by haakon haakonsson king of norway his fleet assembled in bressay sound before sailing for scotland after the stalemate of the battle of largs haakon retreated to orkney where he died in december 1263 entertained on his deathbed by recitations of the sagas his death halted any further norwegian expansion in scotland and following this ill-fated expedition the hebrides and mann were yielded to the kingdom of scotland as a result of the 1266 treaty of perth although the scots recognised continuing norwegian sovereignty over orkney and shetland annexation by scotland in the 14th century orkney and shetland remained a norwegian possession but scottish influence was growing jon haraldsson who was murdered in thurso in 1231 was the last of an unbroken line of norse jarls and thereafter the earls were scots noblemen of the houses of angus and st clair on the death of haakon vi in 1380 norway formed a political union with denmark after which the interest of the royal house in the islands declined in 1469 shetland was pledged by christian i in his capacity as king of norway as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter margaret betrothed to james iii of scotland as the money was never paid the connection with the crown of scotland became permanent in 1470 william sinclair 1st earl of caithness ceded his title to james iii and the following year the northern isles were directly annexed to the crown of scotland an action confirmed by the parliament of scotland in 1472 nonetheless shetlands connection with norway has proved to be enduring from the early 15th century on the shetlanders sold their goods through the hanseatic league of german merchantmen the hansa would buy shiploads of salted fish wool and butter and import salt cloth beer and other goods the late 16th century and early 17th century were dominated by the influence of the despotic robert stewart earl of orkney who was granted the islands by his half-sister mary queen of scots and his son patrick the latter commenced the building of scalloway castle but after his imprisonment in 1609 the crown annexed orkney and shetland again until 1643 when charles i granted them to william douglas 7th earl of morton these rights were held on and off by the mortons until 1766 when they were sold by james douglas 14th earl of morton to laurence dundas 18th and 19th centuries the trade with the north german towns lasted until the 1707 act of union when high salt duties prevented the german merchants from trading with shetland shetland then went into an economic depression as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish however some local merchant-lairds took up where the german merchants had left off and fitted out their own ships to export fish from shetland to the continent for the independent farmers of shetland this had negative consequences as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds smallpox afflicted the islands in the 17th and 18th centuries as it did all of europe but as vaccines became available after 1800 health improved the island was very badly hit by the potato famine of 1846 and the government introduced a relief plan for the island under the command of captain robert craigie of the royal navy who stayed in lerwick to oversee the project 1847-1852 during this period craigie also did much to improve and increase roads on the island population increased to a maximum of 31670 in 1861 however british rule came at price for many ordinary people as well as traders the shetlanders nautical skills were sought by the royal navy some 3000 served during the napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife during this period 120 men were taken from fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home by the late 19th century 90 of all shetland was owned by just 32 people and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8000 shetlanders emigrated with the passing of the crofters act in 1886 the liberal prime minister william gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords the act enabled those who had effectively been landowners serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms by this time fishermen from holland who had traditionally gathered each year off the coast of shetland to fish for herring triggered an industry in the islands that boomed from around 1880 until the 1920s when stocks of the fish began to dwindle the production peaked in 1905 at more than a million barrels of which 708000 were exported 20th century during world war i many shetlanders served in the gordon highlanders a further 3000 served in the merchant navy and more than 1500 in a special local naval reserve the 10th cruiser squadron was stationed at swarbacks minn the stretch of water to the south of muckle roe and during a single year from march 1917 more than 4500 ships sailed from lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system in total shetland lost more than 500 men a higher proportion than any other part of britain and there were further waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s during world war ii a norwegian naval unit nicknamed the shetland bus was established by the special operations executive in the autumn of 1940 with a base first at lunna and later in scalloway to conduct operations around the coast of norway about 30 fishing vessels used by norwegian refugees were gathered and the shetland bus conducted covert operations carrying intelligence agents refugees instructors for the resistance and military supplies it made over 200 trips across the sea and leif larsen the most highly decorated allied naval officer of the war made 52 of them several raf airfields and sites were also established at sullom voe and several lighthouses suffered enemy air attacks oil reserves discovered in the later 20th century in the seas both east and west of shetland have provided a much-needed alternative source of income for the islands the east shetland basin is one of europes largest oil fields and as a result of the oil revenue and the cultural links with norway a small home rule movement developed briefly to recast the constitutional position of shetland it saw as its models the isle of man as well as shetlands closest neighbour the faroe islands an autonomous dependency of denmark economy today the main revenue producers in shetland are agriculture aquaculture fishing renewable energy the petroleum industry crude oil and natural gas production the creative industries and tourism fishing fishing remains central to the islands economy today with the total catch being 75767 tonnes 74570 long tons 83519 short tons in 2009 valued at over 732 million mackerel makes up more than half of the catch in shetland by weight and value and there are significant landings of haddock cod herring whiting monkfish and shellfish energy and fossil fuels oil and gas were first landed in 1978 at sullom voe which has subsequently become one of the largest terminals in europe taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare art sport environmental measures and financial development three quarters of the islands workforce is employed in the service sector and the shetland islands council alone accounted for 279 of output in 2003 shetlands access to oil revenues has funded the shetland charitable trust which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes the balance of the fund in 2011 was 217 million ie about 9500 per head in january 2007 the shetland islands council signed a partnership agreement with scottish and southern energy for the viking wind farm a 200-turbine wind farm and subsea cable this renewable energy project would produce about 600 megawatts and contribute about 20 million to the shetland economy per year the plan met with significant opposition within the islands primarily resulting from the anticipated visual impact of the development the pure project on unst is a research centre which uses a combination of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system the project is run by the unst partnership the local communitys development trust farming and textiles farming is mostly concerned with the raising of shetland sheep known for their unusually fine wool knitwear is important both to the economy and culture of shetland and the fair isle design is well known however the industry faces challenges due to plagiarism of the word shetland by manufacturers operating elsewhere and a certification trademark the shetland lady has been registered crofting the farming of small plots of land on a legally restricted tenancy basis is still practised and is viewed as a key shetland tradition as well as an important source of income crops raised include oats and barley however the cold windswept islands make for a harsh environment for most plants media shetland is served by a weekly local newspaper the shetland times and the online shetland news with radio service being provided by bbc radio shetland and the commercial radio station sibc tourism shetland is a popular destination for cruise ships and in 2010 the lonely planet guide named shetland as the sixth best region in the world for tourists seeking unspoilt destinations the islands were described as beautiful and rewarding and the shetlanders as a fiercely independent and self-reliant bunch overall visitor expenditure was worth 164 million in 2006 in which year just under 26000 cruise liner passengers arrived at lerwick harbour this business has grown substantially with 109 cruise ships already booked in for 2019 representing over 107000 passenger visits in 2009 the most popular visitor

islands is primarily by ferry and shetland islands council operates various inter-island services shetland is also served by a domestic connection from lerwick to aberdeen on mainland scotland this service which takes about 12 hours is operated by northlink ferries some services also call at kirkwall orkney which increases the journey time between aberdeen and lerwick by 2 hours there are plans for road tunnels to some of the islands especially bressay and whalsay however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them sumburgh airport the main airport on shetland is located close to sumburgh head 40km 25mi south of lerwick loganair operates flights to other parts of scotland up to ten times a day the destinations being kirkwall aberdeen inverness glasgow and edinburgh lerwicktingwall airport is located 11km 68mi west of lerwick operated by directflight limited in partnership with shetland islands council it is devoted to inter-island flights from the shetland mainland to most of the inhabited islands scatsta airport near sullom voe allows frequent charter flights from aberdeen to transport oilfield workers and this small terminal has the fifth largest number of international passengers in scotland public bus services are operated on mainland whalsay burra unst and yell the archipelago is exposed to wind and tide and there are numerous sites of wrecked ships lighthouses are sited as an aid to navigation at various locations public services the shetland islands council is the local government authority for all the islands and is based in lerwick town hall shetland is sub-divided into 18 community council areas and into 12 civil parishes that are used for statistical purposes education in shetland there are two high schoolsanderson and braefive junior high schools and 24 primary schools shetland is also home to the north atlantic fisheries college the centre for nordic studies and shetland college which are all associated with the university of the highlands and islands sport the islands are represented by the shetland football team who regularly compete in the island games the islands senior football league is the gs flooring premier league churches and religion religion in shetland 2011 the reformation reached the archipelago in 1560 this was an apparently peaceful transition and there is little evidence of religious intolerance in shetlands recorded history in the 2011 census shetland registered a higher proportion of people with no religion than the scottish average nevertheless a variety of religious denominations are represented in the islands the methodist church has a relatively high membership in shetland which is a district of the methodist church with the rest of scotland comprising a separate district the church of scotland has a presbytery of shetland that includes st columbas church in lerwick the catholic population is served by the church of st margaret and the sacred heart in

electoral region the political composition of the shetland islands council is 21 independents and 1 scottish national party the wir shetland movement was set up in 2015 to campaign for greater autonomy as of early 2018 however the movement appears to be inactive shetland flag roy grnneberg who founded the local chapter of the scottish national party in 1966 designed the flag of shetland in cooperation with bill adams to mark the 500th anniversary of the transfer of the islands from norway to scotland the colours are identical to those of the flag of scotland but are shaped in the nordic cross after several unsuccessful attempts including a plebiscite in 1985 the lord lyon king of arms approved it as the official flag of shetland in 2005 local culture and the arts after the islands were transferred to scotland thousands of scots families emigrated to shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands population indicate that shetlanders are just under half scandinavian in origin a sizeable component of scandinavian patrilineal ancestry has been reported in orkney 55 and shetland 68 this combination is reflected in many aspects of local life for example almost every place name in use can be traced back to the vikings the norn language was a form of old norse which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of scots known as shetlandic which is in turn being replaced by scottish english although norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing and kept alive by organisations such as shetland forwirds isle folk and the shetland folk society the lerwick up helly aa is one of several fire festivals held in shetland annually in the middle of winterit is always started on the last tuesday of january the festival is just over 100 years old in its present highly organised form originally a festival held to break up the long nights of winter and mark the end of yule the festival has become one celebrating the isles heritage and includes a procession of men dressed as vikings and the burning of a replica longship the cuisine of shetland is based on locally produced lamb beef and seafood much of it organic inevitably the real ale-producing valhalla brewery is the most northerly in britain the shetland black is a variety of blue potato with a dark skin and indigo coloured flesh markings shetland competes in the biennial international island games which it hosted in 2005 music shetlands culture and landscapes have inspired a variety of musicians writers and film-makers the forty fiddlers was formed in the 1950s to promote the traditional fiddle style which is a vibrant part of local culture today notable exponents of shetland folk music include aly bain fiddlers bid and the late tom anderson and peerie willie johnson thomas fraser was a country musician who never released a commercial recording during his life but whose work has become popular more than 20 years after his untimely death in 1978 writers walter scotts 1822 novel the pirate is set in a

writer lived in whalsay from the mid-1930s through 1942 and wrote many poems there including a number that directly address or reflect the shetland environment such as on a raised beach which was inspired by a visit to west linga the 1975 novel north star by hammond innes is largely set in shetland and raman mundairs 2007 book of poetry a choreographers cartography offers a british asian

life and ii shetland the quarterly the new shetlander founded in 1947 is said to be scotlands longest-running literary magazine for much of the later 20th century it was the major vehicle for the work of local writers and others including early work by george mackay brown films and television michael powell made the edge of the world in 1937 a dramatisation based on the true story of the evacuation of the last 36 inhabitants of the remote island of st kilda on 29 august 1930 st kilda lies in the atlantic ocean 1466 kilometres 0911mi west of the outer hebrides but powell was unable to get permission to film there undaunted he made the film over four months during the summer of 1936 on foula and the film transposes these events to shetland forty years later the documentary return to the edge of the world was filmed capturing a reunion of cast and crew of the film as they revisited the island in 1978 a number of other films have been made on or about shetland including a crofters life
