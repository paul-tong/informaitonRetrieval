the vapour pressure of water is the pressure at which water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed state at higher pressures water would condense the water vapour pressure is the partial pressure of water vapour in any gas mixture in equilibrium with solid or liquid water as for other substances water vapour pressure is a function of temperature and can be determined with the clausiusclapeyron relation approximation formulas there are many published approximations for calculating saturated vapour pressure over water and over ice some of these are in approximate order of increasing accuracy p exp 20386 5132 t e q 1 displaystyle pexp left20386-frac 5132tright eq1 the antoine equation the august-roche-magnus or magnus-tetens or magnus equation as described in alduchov and eskridge 1996 equation 21 in provides the coefficients used here see also discussion of clausius-clapeyron approximations used in meteorology and climatology where temperaturet is in c and vapour pressurep is in kilopascals kpa the tetens equation where temperaturet is in c and p is in kpa the buck equation where t is in c and p is in kpa the goff-gratch 1946 equation accuracy of different formulations here is a comparison of the accuracies of these different explicit formulations showing saturation vapour pressures for liquid water in kpa calculated at six temperatures with their percentage error from the table values of lide 2005 a more detailed discussion of accuracy and considerations of the inaccuracy in temperature measurements is presented in alduchov and eskridge 1996 the analysis here shows the simple unattributed formula and the antoine equation are reasonably accurate at 100c but quite poor for lower temperatures above freezing tetens is much more accurate over the range from 0 to 50c and very competitive at 75c but antoines is superior at 75c and above the unattributed formula must have zero error at around 26c but is of very poor accuracy outside a very narrow range tetens equations are generally much more accurate and arguably simpler for use at everyday temperatures eg in meteorology as expected bucks equation for t 0c is significantly more accurate than tetens and its superiority increases markedly above 50c though it is more complicated to use the buck equation is even superior to the more complex goff-gratch equation over the range needed for practical meteorology numerical approximations for serious computation lowe 1977 developed two pairs of equations for temperatures above and below freezing with different levels of accuracy they are all very accurate compared to clausius-clapeyron and the goff-gratch but use nested polynomials for very efficient computation however there are more recent reviews of possibly superior formulations notably wexler 1976 1977 reported by flatau et al 1992 graphical pressure dependency on temperature see also dew point gas laws molar mass clausiusclapeyron relation goff-gratch equation antoine equation tetens equation arden buck equation leekesler method vmel holger 2016 saturation vapor pressure formulations boulder co earth observing laboratory national center for atmospheric research archived from the original on june 23 2017 vapor pressure calculator national weather service national oceanic and atmospheric administration
