below is a list of artificial objects leaving the solar system all of these objects are space probes and their upper stages launched by nasa of the major spacecraft voyager 1 voyager 2 and new horizons are still functioning and are regularly contacted by radio communication while pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 are now derelict in addition to these spacecraft some third stages and de-spin weights are leaving the solar system assuming they continue on their trajectories these objects are leaving the solar system because their velocity and direction are taking them away from the sun and at their distance from the sun its gravitational pull is not sufficient to pull these objects back or into orbit they are not impervious to the gravitational pull of the sun and are being slowed down but they are predicted to have enough velocity to coast into interstellar space ie retaining sufficient escape velocity to leave the solar system planetary exploration probes pioneer 10 launched in 1972 flew past jupiter in 1973 and is heading in the direction of aldebaran 65 light years away in the constellation of taurus contact was lost in january 2003 and it is estimated to have passed 120 au pioneer 11 launched in 1973 flew past jupiter in 1974 and saturn in 1979 contact was lost in november 1995 and it is estimated to be at around 100 au the spacecraft is headed toward the constellation of aquila northwest of the constellation of sagittarius barring an incident pioneer 11 will pass near one of the stars in the constellation in about 4 million years voyager 2 launched in august 1977 flew past jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 uranus in 1986 and neptune in 1989 the probe left the heliosphere for interstellar space at 119 au on 5 november 2018 voyager 2 is still active it is not headed toward any particular star although in roughly 40000 years it should pass 17 light-years from the star ross 248 if undisturbed for 296000 years it should pass by the star sirius at a distance of 43 light-years voyager 1 launched in september 1977 flew past jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 making a special close approach to saturns moon titan the probe passed the heliopause at 121 au on 25 august 2012 to enter interstellar space voyager 1 is still active it is headed towards an encounter with star ac 79 3888 which lies 176 light-years from earth in about 40000 years new horizons launched in 2006 the probe flew past jupiter in 2007 and pluto on 14 july 2015 it flew past the kuiper belt object 486958 2014 mu69 nicknamed ultima thule on january 1 2019 as part of the kuiper belt extended mission kem although other probes were launched first voyager 1 has achieved a higher speed and overtaken all others voyager 1 overtook voyager 2 a few months after launch on 19 december 1977 it overtook pioneer 11 in 1983 and then pioneer 10becoming the probe farthest from earthon february 17 1998 voyager 2 is also moving faster than the probes launched earlier having overtaken pioneer 11 by march 1988 it is projected to overtake pioneer 10 in 2023 depending on how the pioneer anomaly affects it new horizons will also probably pass the pioneer probes but will need many years to do so it will not overtake pioneer 11 until the 22nd century will not overtake pioneer 10 until the end of that century and will never overtake the voyagers distance and speed from the sun source heavens above and jpl solar escape velocity is a function of distance r from the suns center given by where the product g msun is the heliocentric gravitational parameter the initial speed required to escape the sun from its surface is 618kms 1380000mph and drops down to 421kms 94000mph at earths distance from the sun 1 au and 421kms 9400mph at a distance of 100 au voyager 1 and 2 speed and distance from the sun voyager 1 and 2 speed and distance from the sun pioneer 10 and 11 speed and distance from the sun pioneer 10 and 11 speed and distance from the sun new horizons speed and distance from the sun new horizons speed and distance from the sun propulsion stages every planetary probe was placed into its escape trajectory by a multistage rocket the last stage of which ends up on nearly the same trajectory as the probe it launched because these stages cannot be actively guided their trajectories are now different from the probes they launched the probes were guided with small thrusters that allow course changes however in cases where the spacecraft acquired escape velocity because of a gravity assist the stages may not have a similar course and there is the remote possibility that they collided with something some objects in heliocentric orbit have been reidentified with a telescope and so their trajectories can be confirmed the stages on an escape trajectory are pioneer 10 third stage a te364-4 variant of the star-37 solid fuel rocket voyager 1 third stage a star 37e solid fuel rocket voyager 2 third stage a star 37e solid fuel rocket new horizons third stage a star 48b solid fuel rocket is on a similar escape trajectory out of the solar system as new horizons even arriving at jupiter by 6 hours before new horizons on oct 15 2015 it passed through plutos orbit at a distance of 213 million kilometers over 1 au distant from pluto this was nearly four months before the new horizons probe did in addition two small yo-yo de-spin weights on wires were used to reduce the spin of the new horizons probe prior to its release from the third-stage rocket once the spin rate was lowered these masses and the wires were released and so are also on an escape trajectory out of the solar system none of these objects are trackable they have no power or radio antennae spin uncontrollably and are too small to be detected and their exact positions are unknowable beyond their projected solar system escape trajectories the third stage of pioneer 11 is thought to be in solar orbit because its encounter with jupiter would not have resulted in escape from the solar system pioneer 11 gained the required velocity to escape the solar system in its subsequent encounter with saturn the only objects to date to be launched directly into a solar escape trajectory were the new horizons spacecraft its third stage and the two de-spin masses the new horizons centaur second stage is not escaping it is in a 283-year heliocentric solar orbit the pioneer 10 and 11 and voyager 1 and 2 centaur second stages are also in heliocentric orbits in order to leave the solar system the probe needs to reach the escape velocity after leaving earth the suns escape velocity is 421kms in order to reach this speed it is highly advantageous to use the orbital speed of the earth around the sun which is 2978kms by passing near a planet a probe can gain extra speed on january 19 2006 the new horizons spacecraft to pluto was launched directly into a solar-escape trajectory at 1626 kilometers per second 58536kmh 36373mph from cape canaveral using an atlas v version with 5 of the aj-60a srbs and the common core booster centaur upper stage and star 48b third stage new horizons passed the moons orbit in just nine hours propulsive units for new horizons which was launched directly to a solar escape velocity from earth atlas v common core booster first stage aj-60a strap on boosters centaur upper stage star 48b new horizons spacecraft thrusters 77 kilograms 170 pounds of hydrazine
