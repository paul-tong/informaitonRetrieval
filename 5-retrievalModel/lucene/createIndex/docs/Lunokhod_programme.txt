lunokhod russian ipalnxot moonwalker was a series of soviet robotic lunar rovers designed to land on the moon between 1969 and 1977 lunokhod 1 was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another world the 1969 lunokhod 1a lunokhod 0 lunokhod no201 was destroyed during launch the 1970 lunokhod 1 and the 1973 lunokhod 2 landed on the moon and lunokhod 3 lunokhod no205 planned for 1977 was never launched the successful missions were in operation concurrently with the zond and luna series of moon flyby orbiter and landing missions the lunokhods were primarily designed to support the soviet manned moon missions during the moon race instead they were used as remote-controlled robots for exploration of the lunar surface and return its pictures after the successful apollo manned lunar landings and cancellation of the soviet manned moon program the lunokhods were transported to the lunar surface by luna spacecraft which were launched by proton-k rockets the moon lander part of the luna spacecraft for lunokhods was similar to the one for sample-return missions the lunokhods were designed by alexander kemurdzhian at lavochkin not until the 1997 mars pathfinder was another remote-controlled vehicle put on an extraterrestrial body in 2010 nearly forty years after the 1971 loss of signal from lunokhod 1 the nasa lunar reconnaissance orbiter photographed its tracks and final location and researchers using a telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder detected the robots retroreflector development lunokhods original primary mission was the back-up for l3 manned moon expeditions and for the later zvezda lunar base for mission safety weeks before the manned mission on lk lander an lk-r lander in unmanned l3 lunar expedition complex and two lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the moon for preliminary study of surface around lk-r and lk sites for work as radio beacons for precision landings of lk-r and lk and for visual estimate of status of them lk-r used as a reserve escape craft in case of disability to start from moon of lk and lunokhods used by cosmonaut for transfer to lk-r in necessity and for regular research this manned version of lunokhod were additionally equipped with oxygen stock with hose socket standing pads and manual control for the cosmonaut in front part in mid-1968 at the facility kip-10 or nip-10 -10 or -10 in the secret village shkolnoye ru - closed town simferopol-28 near simferopol a lunodrom - moondrome was built it covered an area of one hectare 120 meters by 70 meters and was very similar to some parts of the lunar surface it was constructed using more than 3000 cubic meters of soil and included 54 craters up to 16 m in diameter and around about 160 rocks of various sizes the whole area was surrounded with bricks painted in gray and black it was used to analyze problems with the lunokhod chassis and cosmonauts skill to control one closed town simferopol-28 contained the most significant tracking facility in the soviet union having the largest number of antennas the largest area and the most personnel of any of the soviet tracking facilities the facility was one of a network of ten facilities which contain earth satellite vehicle tracking equipment and provide commandcontrol for soviet near-space civil and military events additionally this facility supported all lunar programs of soviet union in association with the evpatoria deep space tracking facility at least four complete vehicles were constructed with the serial numbers 201 203 204 and 205 lunokhod 201 after years of secret engineering development and training the first lunokhod vehicle 8201 was launched on february 19 1969 within a few seconds the rocket disintegrated and the first lunokhod was lost the rest of the world did not learn of the rockets valuable payload until years later the failure resulted in the radioactive heat source polonium 210 being spread over a large region of russia lunokhod 1 after the destruction of the original lunokhod soviet engineers began work immediately on another lunar vehicle lunokhod 1 vehicle 8203 was the first of two unmanned lunar rovers successfully landed on the moon by the soviet union as part of its lunokhod program the spacecraft which carried lunokhod 1 was named luna 17 lunokhod 1 was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another world luna 17 was launched on november 10 1970 at 144401 utc after reaching earth parking orbit the final stage of luna 17s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the moon november 10 1970 at 1454 utc after two course correction manoeuvres on november 12 and 14 it entered lunar orbit on november 15 1970 at 2200 utc the spacecraft soft-landed on the moon in the sea of rains on november 17 1970 at 0347 utc the lander had dual ramps from which the payload lunokhod 1 could descend to the lunar surface at 0628 ut the rover moved down the ramps and onto the moon to be able to work in a vacuum a special fluoride based lubricant was used for the rovers mechanical parts and the electric motors one in each wheel hub were enclosed in pressurised containers the rover ran during the lunar day stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries via the solar panels at night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise heated by the radioisotope heater unit rover description lunokhod 1 was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels its length was 23 metres lunokhod 1 was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna a highly directional helical antenna four television cameras and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for density measurements and mechanical property tests an x-ray spectrometer an x-ray telescope cosmic ray detector and a laser device were also included the vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the lunar day by a solar cell array mounted on the underside of the lid during the lunar nights the lid was closed and a polonium-210 heat source kept the internal components at operating temperature the rover stood 135cm 4ft 5 in high and had a mass of 840kg 1850lb it was about 170cm 5ft 7 in long and 160cm 4ft 11 in wide and had eight wheels each with an independent suspension motor and brake the rover had two speeds approximately 1 and 2kmh 06 and 12mph payload the rovers payload included cameras two tv and four panoramic telephotometers a rifma x-ray fluorescence spectrometer an rt-1 x-ray telescope a prop odometerpenetrometer a rv-2n radiation detector and a tl laser retroreflector lunokhod 2 lunokhod 2 vehicle 8204 was the second and more advanced of the two unmanned lunar rovers landed on the moon by the soviet union as part of the lunokhod program the launcher put the spacecraft into earth parking orbit on january 8 1973 followed by a translunar injection on january 12 1973 luna 21 was braked into a 90 by 100km 56 by 62 miles lunar orbit the luna 21 spacecraft landed on the moon to deploy the second soviet lunar rover lunokhod 2 the primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the moon perform laser ranging experiments from earth observe solar x-rays measure local magnetic fields and study mechanical properties of the lunar surface material the landing occurred on january 15 1973 at 2335 ut in le monnier crater 2585 degrees n 3045 degrees e after landing the lunokhod 2 took tv images of the surrounding area then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 0114 ut on 1973-01-16 it then took pictures of the luna 21 lander and landing site rover description lunokhod 2 was equipped with three slow-scan television cameras one mounted high on the rover for navigation which could return high resolution images at different rates32 57 109 or 211 seconds per frame not frames per second these images were used by the five-man team of controllers on earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time there were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover power was supplied by a solar panel on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay which would charge the batteries when opened a polonium-210 radioactive heat source was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester solar x-ray experiment an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 25 m 8ft 2 in boom a radiometer a photodetector rubin-1 for laser detection experiments and a french-supplied laser corner reflector payload cameras three tv four panoramic telephotometers rifma-m x-ray fluorescence spectrometer x-ray telescope prop odometerpenetrometer rv-2n-ls radiation detector tl laser retroreflector af-3l uvvisible astrophotometer sg-70a magnetometer rubin 1 photodetector lunokhod 3 lunokhod 3 vehicle 8205 was built for a moon landing in 1977 as luna 25 but never flew to the moon due to lack of launchers and funding it remains at the npo lavochkin museum results during its 322 earth days of operations lunokhod 1 traveled 105km 65 miles and returned more than 20000 tv images and 206 high-resolution panoramas in addition it performed twenty-five soil analyses with its rifma x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and used its penetrometer at 500 different locations lunokhod 2 operated for about four months covered 42km 26 miles of terrain including driving into hilly upland areas and rilles lunokhod 2 held the record for the longest distance of surface travel of any extraterrestrial vehicle until 2014 it sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80000 tv pictures many mechanical tests of the moons surface laser ranging measurements and other experiments were completed during this time for comparison the similarly sized nasa mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity had by their fifth anniversary in january 2009 traveled a total of 21km 13 miles and transmitted over 125000 images chernobyl legacy according to a french documentary tv film tank on the moon by jean afanassieff the lunokhod design returned to limelight 15 years later due to the chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster on april 26 1986 the east german-built remote controlled bulldozers available to soviet civil defense troops weighed dozens of tons too heavy to operate on the remaining parts of the partially collapsed reactor building roof human laborers could not be employed effectively to shovel debris since work shifts were limited to 90 second intervals due to intense ionizing radiation lunokhod designers were called back from retirement and in two weeks rovers were made which used nuclear decay heat sources for internal rack climate control their electronic systems were already hardened to partly resist radiation this benefit allowed the 1986 designers to quickly devise a derived vehicle type for nuclear disaster recovery work on july 15 two rovers called str-1 were delivered to the chernobyl accident zone and proved useful for clearing debris earning awards for the designers due to extremely high radiation levels both str-1 rovers eventually failed and human workers later named liquidators were once again called in locations and ownership until 2010 the final location of lunokhod 1 was uncertain by a few kilometers lunar laser ranging experiments had failed to detect a return signal from its retroreflector since the 1970s on march 17 2010 albert abdrakhimov found both the lander and the rover in lunar reconnaissance orbiter image m114185541rc on april 22 tom murphy ucsd and russet mcmillan at the apache point observatory detected the robots retroreflector using the apache point telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder lunokhod 2 continues to be detected by lunar laser ranging experiments and its position is known to sub-meter accuracy ownership of lunokhod 2 and the luna 21 lander was sold by the lavochkin association for us68500 in december 1993 at a sothebys auction in new york although the catalog incorrectly lists lot 68a as luna 17lunokhod 1 the buyer was computer gaming entrepreneur and astronauts son richard garriott who is also known by the name of his gaming character lord british garriott stated in a 2001 interview i purchased lunakod 21 sic from the russians i am now the worlds only private owner of an object on a foreign celestial body though there are international treaties that say no government shall lay claim to geography off planet earth i am not a government summarily i claim the moon in the name of lord british in 2007 garriott said he is
