the mori mari mori pronunciationmai listen are the indigenous polynesian people of new zealand mori originated with settlers from eastern polynesia who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages some time between 1250 and 1300 over several centuries in isolation the polynesian settlers developed a unique culture with their own language a rich mythology and distinctive crafts and performing arts early mori formed tribal groups based on eastern polynesian social customs and organisation horticulture flourished using plants they introduced later a prominent warrior culture emerged the arrival of europeans to new zealand starting in the 17th century brought enormous changes to the mori way of life mori people gradually adopted many aspects of western society and culture initial relations between mori and europeans were largely amicable and with the signing of the treaty of waitangi in 1840 the two cultures coexisted as part of a new british colony rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s social upheaval decades of conflict and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the mori population which fell dramatically by the start of the 20th century the mori population had begun to recover and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider new zealand society and achieve social justice traditional mori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival which was further bolstered by a mori protest movement that emerged in the 1960s in the 2013 census there were approximately 600000 people in new zealand identifying as mori making up roughly 15 percent of the national population they are the second-largest ethnic group in new zealand after european new zealanders pkeh in addition more than 140000 mori live in australia the mori language is spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all mori representing 3 per cent of the total population mori are active in all spheres of new zealand culture and society with independent representation in areas such as media politics and sport disproportionate numbers of mori face significant economic and social obstacles and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other new zealand ethnic groups they suffer higher levels of crime health problems and educational under-achievement a number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of closing the gap between mori and other new zealanders political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing see treaty of waitangi claims and settlements etymology in the mori language the word mori means normal natural or ordinary in legends and oral traditions the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beingstngata morifrom deities and spirits wairua likewise wai mori denotes fresh water as opposed to salt water there are cognate words in most polynesian languages all deriving from proto-polynesian maaqoli which has the reconstructed meaning true real genuine the spelling of mori with or without the macron is inconsistent in general-interest english-language media in new zealand although some newspapers and websites have adopted the standard mori-language spelling ie with macrons naming and self-naming early visitors from europe to new zealand generally referred to the indigenous inhabitants as new zealanders or as natives the mori used the term mori to describe themselves in a pan-tribal sense mori people often use the term tangata whenua literally people of the land to identify in a way that expresses their relationship with a particular area of land a tribe may be the tangata whenua in one area but not in another the term can also refer to the mori people as a whole in relation to new zealand aotearoa as a whole the mori purposes act of 1947 required the use of the term mori rather than native in official usage the department of native affairs was renamed as the department of mori affairs since 1992 it has been known as te puni kkiri or the ministry for mori development before 1974 the government required documented ancestry to determine the legal definition of a mori person for example bloodlines or percentage of mori ancestry was used to determine whether a person should enroll on the general electoral roll or the separate mori roll in 1947 the authorities determined that a man who was five-eighths mori had improperly voted in the general parliamentary electorate of raglan the mori affairs amendment act 1974 changed the definition allowing individuals to self-identify as to their cultural identity in matters involving financial benefits provided by the government to people of mori ethnicityscholarships for example or waitangi tribunal settlementsauthorities generally require some documentation of ancestry or continuing cultural connection such as acceptance by others as being of the people but no minimum blood requirement exists as determined by the government history origins the most current reliable evidence strongly indicates that the initial settlement of new zealand occurred around 1280 ce at the end of the medieval warm period previous dating of some kiore polynesian rat bones at 50150 has now been shown to have been unreliable new samples of bone and now also of unequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases match the 1280 date of the earliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained deforestation by humans mori oral history describes the arrival of ancestors from hawaiki the mythical homeland in tropical polynesia in large ocean-going waka migration accounts vary among tribes iwi whose members may identify with several waka in their genealogies whakapapa in the last few decades mitochondrial-dna mtdna research has allowed an estimate to be made of the number of women in the founding populationbetween 50 and 100 evidence from archaeology linguistics and physical anthropology indicates that the first settlers came from east polynesia and became the mori language-evolution studies and mtdna evidence suggest that most pacific populations originated from taiwanese aborigines around 5200 years ago suggesting prior migration from the asian or chinese mainland these ancestors moved down through southeast asia and indonesia analysis by kayser et al 2008 discovered that only 21 of the maori-polynesian autosomal gene pool is of melanesian origin with the rest 79 being of east asian origin another study by friedlaender et al 2008 also confirmed that polynesians are closer genetically to micronesians taiwanese aborigines and east asians than to melanesians the study concluded that polynesians moved through melanesia fairly rapidly allowing only limited admixture between austronesians and melanesians thus the high frequencies of mtdna b4a1a1 in the polynesians are the result of drift and represent the descendants of a few east asian females who mixed with papuan males the polynesian population experienced a founder effect and genetic drift recent dna studies show that the ancestors of the polynesian people including maori are from taiwan and from the northern philippines they did not mix with the melanesians natives but displaced them mostly archaic period 12801500 the earliest period of mori settlement is known as the archaic moahunter or colonisation period the eastern polynesian ancestors of the mori arrived in a forested land with abundant birdlife including several now extinct moa species weighing between 20 kilograms 44lb and 250kg 550lb each other species also now extinct included a swan a goose and the giant haasts eagle which preyed upon the moa marine mammalsseals in particularthronged the coasts with evidence of coastal colonies much further north than those which remain today huge numbers of moa bonesestimated to be from between 29000 and 90000 birdshave been located at the mouth of the waitaki river between timaru and oamaru on the east coast of the south island further south at the mouth of the shag river waihemo evidence suggests that at least 6000 moa were slaughtered by humans over a relatively short period of time archaeology has shown that the otago region was the node of mori cultural development during this time and the majority of archaic settlements were on or within 10km 6mi of the coast it was common for people to establish small temporary camps far inland for seasonal hunting settlements ranged in size from 40 people eg palliser bay in wellington to between 300 and 400 people with 40 buildings such as at the shag river the best-known and most extensively studied archaic site is at wairau bar in the south island the site is similar to eastern polynesian nucleated villages radiocarbon dating shows the site was occupied from about 1288 to 1300 due to tectonic forces some of the wairau bar site is now underwater work on the wairau bar skeletons in 2010 showed that life expectancy was very short the oldest skeleton being 39 and most people dying in their 20s most of the adults showed signs of dietary or infection stress anemia and arthritis were common infections such as tuberculosis tb may have been present as the symptoms were present in several skeletons on average the adults were taller than other south pacific people at 175 centimetres 5ft 9in for males and 161cm 5ft 3in for females the archaic period is remarkable for the lack of weapons and fortifications so typical of the later classic mori and for its distinctive reel necklaces from this period onward some 32 species of birds became extinct either through over-predation by humans and the kiore and kur dog they introduced repeated burning of the grassland that changed their habitat or climate cooling which appears to have occurred from about 14001450 the early mori enjoyed a rich varied diet of birds fish seals and shellfish moa were also an important source of meat according to professor allan cooper the people slaughtered to extinction most of the various lost species within 100 years work by helen leach shows that mori were using about 36 different food plants although many required detoxification and long periods 1224 hours of cooking d suttons research on early mori fertility found that first pregnancy occurred at about 20 years and the mean number of births was low compared with other neolithic societies the low number of births may have been due to the very low average life expectancy of 3132 years analysis of skeletons at wairau bar showed signs of a hard life with many having had broken bones that had healed this suggests that the people ate a balanced diet and enjoyed a supportive community that had the resources to support severely injured family members classic period 15001642 the cooling of the climate confirmed by a detailed tree-ring study near hokitika shows a significant sudden and long-lasting cooler period from 1500 this coincided with a series of massive earthquakes in the south island alpine fault a major earthquake in 1460 in the wellington area tsunamis that destroyed many coastal settlements and the extinction of the moa and other food species these were likely factors that led to sweeping changes in the mori culture which developed into the classic period that was in place at the time of european contact this period is characterised by finely made pounamu greenstone weapons and ornaments elaborately carved canoesa tradition that was later extended to and continued in elaborately carved meeting houses called wharenuiand a fierce warrior culture they developed hillforts known as p practiced cannibalism and built some of the largest war canoes ever around the year 1500 a group of mori migrated east to the chatham islands where by adapting to the local climate and the availability of resources they developed into a people known as the moriori related to but distinct from the mori of mainland new zealand a notable feature of moriori culture was an emphasis on pacifism when a party of invading north taranaki mori arrived in 1835 few of the estimated moriori population of 2000 survived they were killed outright and many were enslaved the largest battle ever fought in new zealand the battle of hingakaka occurred around 178090 south of haup on a ridge near lake ngaroto the battle was fought between about 7000 warriors from a taranaki-led force and a much smaller waikato force under the leadership of te rauangaanga early european contact 16421840 european settlement of new zealand occurred in relatively recent historical times new zealand historian michael king in the penguin history of new zealand describes the mori as the last major human community on earth untouched and unaffected by the wider world early european explorers including abel tasman who arrived in 1642 and captain james cook who first visited in 1769 recorded their impressions of mori initial contact between mori and europeans proved problematic and sometimes fatal with several accounts of europeans being cannibalised from the 1780s mori encountered european and american sealers and whalers some mori crewed on the foreign ships with many crewing on whaling and sealing ships that operated in new zealand waters some of the south island crews were almost totally mori between 1800 and 1820 there were 65 sealing voyages and 106 whaling voyages to new zealand mainly from britain and australia a trickle of escaped convicts from australia and deserters from visiting ships as well as early christian missionaries also exposed the indigenous population to outside influences in the boyd massacre in 1809 mori took hostage and killed 66 members of the crew and passengers of the sailing ship boyd in apparent revenge for the captain whipping the son of a mori chief given accounts of cannibalism in this attack shipping companies and missionaries kept their distance significantly reducing their contact with the mori for several years the runaways were of various standing within mori society ranging from slaves to high-ranking advisors some runaways remained little more than prisoners while others abandoned european culture and identified as mori these europeans gone native became known as pkeh mori many mori valued them as a means to acquire european knowledge and technology particularly firearms when whiria pmare ii led a war-party against ttore in 1838 he had 131 europeans among his warriors frederick edward maning an early settler wrote two lively accounts of life in these times which have become classics of new zealand literature old new zealand and history of the war in the north of new zealand against the chief heke european settlement of new zealand increased steadily by 1839 estimates placed the number of europeans living among the mori as high as 2000 two-thirds lived in the north island especially in the northland peninsula contact with europeans led to a sharing of concepts the mori language was first written down by thomas kendall in 1815 in a korao no new zealand this was followed five years later by a grammar and vocabulary of the new zealand language compiled by professor samuel lee and aided by kendall waikato mori and the chief hongi hika on a visit to england in 1820 mori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form between february 1835 and january 1840 william colenso printed 74000 mori-language booklets from his press at paihia in 1843 the government distributed free gazettes to mori called ko te karere o nui tireni these contained information about law and crimes with explanations and remarks about european customs and were designed to pass on official information to mori and to encourage the idea that pkeh and mori were contracted together under the treaty of waitangi between 1805 and 1840 the acquisition of muskets by tribes in close contact with european visitors upset the balance of power among mori tribes this led to a period of bloody intertribal warfare known as the musket wars which resulted in the decimation of several tribes and the driving of others from their traditional territory it has been estimated that during this period the mori population dropped from about 100000 in 1800 to between 50000 and 80000 by the wars end in 1843 the 1850s were a decade of relative stability and economic growth for mori the picture is confused by uncertainty over how or if pkeh mori were counted and the severe dislocation of many of the less powerful iwi and hap subtribes during the wars the smashing of normal society by the four decades of wars and the driving of peaceful tribes from their productive turangawaewae such as the moriori in the chatham islands by invading forces from north taranaki had a catastrophic effect on these conquered tribes at the same time the mori suffered high mortality rates for new eurasian infectious diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles which killed an unknown number of mori estimates vary between ten and fifty percent the spread of epidemics resulted largely from the mori lacking acquired immunity to the new diseases a huge influx of european settlers in the 1870s increased contact among many of the indigenous people with the newcomers te rangi hroa documents an epidemic caused by a respiratory disease that mori called rewharewha it decimated populations in the early 19th century and spread with extraordinary virulence throughout the north island and even to the south measles typhoid scarlet fever whooping cough and almost everything except plague and sleeping sickness have taken their toll of mori dead economic changes also took a toll migration of mori workers into unhealthy swamplands to produce and export flax led to further mortality treaty with the british crown 1840 with increasing christian missionary activity and growing european settlement in the 1830s and with growing lawlessness in new zealand the british crown acceded to repeated requests from missionaries and some chiefs rangatira to intervene some freewheeling escaped convicts and seamen as well as gunrunners and americans actively worked against the british government by spreading rumours amongst the mori that the government would oppress and mistreat them tamati waka nene a pro-government chief was angry that the government had not taken active steps to stop gunrunners selling weapons to rebels in hokianga in addition france appeared to be showing interest in acquiring new zealand to add to its stake in polynesia british immigrants believed that the french catholic missionaries were spreading anti-british feeling all of the chiefs who spoke against the treaty on 5 february 1840 were catholic years after the treaty was signed bishop pompallier admitted that all the catholic chiefs and especially rewa had consulted him for advice ultimately the british government sent royal navy captain william hobson with instructions to negotiate a treaty between the british crown and the people of new zealand soon after arrival in new zealand in february 1840 hobson negotiated a treaty with north island chiefs later to become known as the treaty of waitangi in the end 500 tribal chiefs and a small number of europeans signed the treaty while some chiefs such as te wherowhero in waikato refused to sign the treaty gave mori the rights of british subjects and guaranteed mori property rights and tribal autonomy in return for accepting british sovereignty considerable dispute continues over aspects of the treaty of waitangi the original treaty was written mainly by busby and translated into mori by henry williams who was moderately proficient in mori and his son william who was more skilled they were handicapped by their imperfect mori and the lack of exactly similar words in mori as well as by deep differences among the peoples on concepts of property rights and sovereignty for example at waitangi the chiefs signed the mori translation land disputes and conflict despite conflicting interpretations of the provisions of the treaty of waitangi relations between mori and europeans during the early colonial period were largely peaceful many mori groups set up substantial businesses supplying food and other products for domestic and overseas markets among the early european settlers who learnt the mori language and recorded mori mythology george grey governor of new zealand from 18451855 and 18611868 stands out however rising tensions over disputed land purchases and attempts by mori in the waikato to establish what some saw as a rival to the british system of royalty led to the new zealand wars in the 1860s these conflicts started when rebel mori attacked isolated settlers in taranaki but were fought mainly between crown troopsfrom both britain and new regiments raised in australia aided by settlers and some allied mori known as kupapaand numerous mori groups opposed to the disputed land sales including some waikato mori while these conflicts resulted in few mori compared to the earlier musket wars or european deaths the colonial government confiscated tracts of tribal land as punishment for what were called rebellions in some cases the government confiscated land from tribes that had taken no part in the war although this was almost immediately returned some of the confiscated land was returned to both kupapa and rebel mori several minor conflicts also arose after the wars including the incident at parihaka in 1881 and the dog tax war from 189798 the native land acts of 1862 and 1865 established the native land court which was intended to transfer mori land from communal ownership into individual household title as a means to assimilation and to facilitate greater sales to european immigrants mori land under individual title became available to be sold to the colonial government or to settlers in private sales between 1840 and 1890 mori sold 95 percent of their land 63000000 of 66000000 acres 270000km in 1890 in total 4 per cent of this was confiscated land although about a quarter of this was returned 300000 acres was returned to kupapa mori mainly in the lower waikato river basin area individual mori titleholders received considerable capital from these land sales with some lower waikato chiefs being given 1000 pounds each disputes later arose over whether or not promised compensation in some sales was fully delivered some claim that later the selling off of mori land and the lack of appropriate skills hampered mori participation in developing the new zealand economy eventually diminishing the capacity of many mori to sustain themselves the mori mp henare kaihau from waiuku who was executive head of the king movement worked alongside king mahuta to sell land to the government at that time the king sold 185000 acres per year in 1910 the mori land conference at waihi discussed selling a further 600000 acres king mahuta had been successful in getting restitution for some blocks of land previously confiscated and these were returned to the king in his name henare kaihau invested all the money- 50000 pounds- in an auckland land company which collapsed all 50000 pounds of the kingitanga money was lost in 1884 king twhiao withdrew money from the kingitanga bank te peeke o aotearoa to travel to london to see queen victoria to try and persuade her to honour the treaty between their peoples he did not get past the secretary of state for the colonies who said it was a new zealand problem returning to new zealand the premier robert stout insisted that all events happening before 1863 were the responsibility of the imperial government by 1891 mori comprised just 10 per cent of the population but still owned 17 per cent of the land although much of it was of poor quality decline and revival by the late 19th century a widespread belief existed amongst both pkeh and mori that the mori population would cease to exist as a separate race or culture and become assimilated into the european population in 1840 new zealand had a mori population of about 50000 to 70000 and only about 2000 europeans by 1860 the europeans had increased to 50000 the mori population had declined to 37520 in the 1871 census although te rangi hroa sir peter buck believed this figure was too low the figure was 42113 in the 1896 census by which time europeans numbered more than 700000 professor ian pool noticed that as late as 1890 40 per cent of all female mori children who were born died before the age of one a much higher rate than for males the decline of the mori population did not continue it stabilized and began to recover by 1936 the mori figure was 82326 although the sudden rise in the 1930s was probably due to the introduction of the family benefit payable only when a birth was registered according to professor pool despite a substantial level of intermarriage between the mori and european populations many ethnic mori retained their cultural identity a number of discourses developed as to the meaning of mori and to who counted as mori or not the parliament instituted four mori seats in 1867 giving all mori men universal suffrage 12 years ahead of their european new zealand counterparts until the 1879 general elections men had to satisfy property requirements of landowning or rental payments to qualify as voters new zealand was thus the first neo-european nation in the world to give the vote to its indigenous people while the mori seats encouraged mori participation in politics the relative size of the mori population of the time vis vis pkeh would have warranted approximately 15 seats from the late 19th century successful mori politicians such as james carroll pirana ngata te rangi hroa and maui pomare were influential in politics at one point carroll became acting prime minister the group known as the young mori party cut across voting-blocs in parliament and aimed to revitalise the mori people after the devastation of the previous century they believed the future path called for a degree of assimilation with mori adopting european practices such as western medicine and education especially learning english ngata acted as a major force behind the revival of arts such as kapa haka and carving he also enacted a programme of land development which helped many iwi retain and develop their land ngata became very close to te puea the waikato kingite leader who was supported by the government in her attempt to improve living conditions for waikato ngata transferred four blocks of land to te puea and her husband and arranged extensive government grants and loans ngata sacked the pakeha farm development officer and replaced him with te puea he arranged for her to have a car to travel around the various farms te pueas husband was also given a large farm at tikitere near rotorua the public media and parliament became alarmed at the flow of funds from government to te puea during the recession a royal commission was held in 1934 that found ngata guilty of maladministration and misappropriation of funds to the value of 500000 pounds ngata was forced to resign during the first world war a mori pioneer force was taken to egypt but quickly was turned into a successful combat infantry battalion in the last years of the war it was known as the mori battalion it mainly comprised te arawa te aitanga-a-mhaki te aitanga-a-hauiti ngti porou and ngti kahungun and later many cook islanders the waikato and taranaki tribes refused to enlist or be conscripted mori were badly hit by the 1918 influenza epidemic when the mori battalion returned from the western front the death rate from influenza for mori was 45 times higher than for pakeha many mori especially in the waikato were very reluctant to visit a doctor and went to a hospital only when the patient was nearly dead to cope with isolation waikato mori under te pueas leadership increasingly returned to the old pai mrire hau hau cult of the 1860s until 1893 53 years after the treaty of waitangi mori did not pay tax on land holdings in 1893 a very light tax was payable only on leasehold land and it was not till 1917 that mori were required to pay a heavier tax equal to half that paid by other new zealanders during the second world war the government decided to exempt mori from the conscription that applied to other citizens the mori volunteered in large numbers forming the 28th or mori battalion which performed creditably notably in crete north africa and italy altogether 16000 mori took part in the war mori including cook islanders made up 12 per cent of the total new zealand force 3600 served in the mori battalion the remainder serving in artillery pioneers home guard infantry airforce and navy recent history 1960spresent since the 1960s moridom has undergone a cultural revival concurrent with activism for social justice and a protest movement government recognition of the growing political power of mori and political activism have led to limited redress for confiscation of land and for the violation of other property rights in 1975 the crown set up the waitangi tribunal a body with the powers of a commission of enquiry to investigate and make recommendations on such issues but it cannot make binding rulings the government need not accept the findings of the waitangi tribunal and has rejected some of them since 1976 people of mori descent may choose to enroll on either the general or mori roll and vote in either the mori only or general electorates but not both during the 1990s and 2000s the government negotiated with mori to provide redress for breaches by the crown of the guarantees set out in the treaty of waitangi in 1840 by 2006 the government had provided over nz900 million in settlements much of it in the form of land deals the largest settlement signed on 25 june 2008 with seven mori iwi transferred nine large tracts of forested land to mori control as a result of the redress paid to many iwi mori now have significant interests in the fishing and forestry industries there is a growing mori leadership who are using the treaty settlements as an investment platform for economic development despite a growing acceptance of mori culture in wider new zealand society the settlements have generated controversy on both sides some mori have complained that the settlements occur at a level of between 1 and 25 cents on the dollar of the value of the confiscated lands conversely some non-mori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic iniatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment both of these sentiments were expressed during the new zealand foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004 demographics in the 2013 census 598605 people identified as being part of the mori ethnic group accounting for 149 per cent of the new zealand population while 668724 people 175 per cent claimed mori descent of those identifying as mori 278199 people identified as of sole mori ethnicity while 260229 identified as of both european and mori ethnicity due to the high rate of intermarriage between the two cultures under the mori affairs amendment act 1974 a mori is defined as a person of the mori race of new zealand and includes any descendant of such a person according to the 2013 census the largest iwi by population is ngpuhi 125601 followed by ngti porou 71049 ngi tahu 54819 and waikato 40083 however over 110000 people of mori descent could not identify their iwi outside of new zealand a large mori population exists in australia estimated at 155000 in 2011 the mori party has suggested a special seat should be created in the new zealand parliament representing mori in australia smaller communities also exist in the united kingdom approx 8000 the united states up to 3500 and canada approx 1000 culture traditional culture the ancestors of the mori arrived from eastern polynesia during the 13th century bringing with them polynesian cultural customs and beliefs early european researchers such as julius von haast a geologist incorrectly interpreted archaeological remains as belonging to a pre-mori paleolithic people later researchers notably percy smith magnified such theories into an elaborate scenario with a series of sharply-defined cultural stages which had mori arriving in a great fleet in 1350 and replacing the so-called moa-hunter culture with a classical mori culture based on horticulture the development of mori material culture has been similarly delineated by the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa into cultural periods from the earlier ng kakano stage to the later te tipunga period before the classic period of mori history however the archaeological record indicates a gradual evolution of a neolithic culture that varied in pace and extent according to local resources and conditions in the course of a few centuries the growing population led to competition for resources and an increase in warfare the archaeological record reveals an increased frequency of fortified p although debate continues about the amount of conflict various systems arose which aimed to conserve resources most of these such as tapu and rhui used religious or supernatural threats to discourage people from taking species at particular seasons or from specified areas warfare between tribes was common generally over land conflicts or to restore mana fighting was carried out between hap although not practised during times of peace mori would sometimes eat their conquered enemies as mori continued in geographic isolation performing arts such as the haka developed from their polynesian roots as did carving and weaving regional dialects arose with differences in vocabulary and in the pronunciation of some words in 1819 two young northern chiefs tuai and titere who had learnt to speak and write english went to london where they met the language expert samuel lee they stayed with a school teacher hall who they told that even in northern new zealand there were different languages and dialects the language retained enough similarities to other eastern polynesian languages to the point where tupaia the tahitian navigator on james cooks first voyage in the region acted as an interpreter between mori and the crew of the endeavour belief and religion traditional mori beliefs have their origins in polynesian culture many stories from mori mythology are analogous with stories across the pacific ocean polynesian concepts such as tapu sacred noa non-sacred mana authorityprestige and wairua spirit governed everyday mori living these practices remained until the arrival of europeans when much of mori religion and mythology was supplanted by christianity today mori tend to be followers of presbyterianism the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints mormons or mori christian groups such as rtana and ringat but with catholic anglican and methodist groupings also prominent islam is estimated as the fastest growing religion among mori yet mori muslims constitute a very small proportion of mori at the 2013 new zealand census 88 percent of mori were affiliated with mori christian denominations and 396 percent with other christian denominations 463 percent of mori claimed no religion proportions of christian and irreligious mori are comparable with european new zealanders performing arts kapa haka literally haka team is a traditional mori performance art encompassing many forms that is still popular today it includes haka posture dance poi dance accompanied by song and rhythmic movements of the poi a light ball on a string waiata--ringa action songs and waiata koroua traditional chants from the early 20th century kapa haka concert parties began touring overseas since 1972 there has been a regular competition the te matatini national festival organised by the aotearoa traditional mori performing arts society mori from different regions send representative groups to compete in the biennial competition there are also kapa haka groups in schools tertiary institutions and workplaces it is also performed at tourist venues across the country literature and media like other cultures oral folklore was used by mori to preserve their stories and beliefs across many centuries in the 19th century european-style literacy was brought to the mori which led to mori history documentation in books novels and later television mori language use began to decline in the 20th century with english as the language through which mori literature became widespread notable mori novelists include patricia grace witi ihimaera and alan duff once were warriors a 1994 film adapted from a 1990 novel of the same name by alan duff brought the plight of some urban mori to a wide audience it was the highest-grossing film in new zealand until 2006 and received international acclaim winning several international film prizes while some mori feared that viewers would consider the violent male characters an accurate portrayal of mori men most critics praised it as exposing the raw side of domestic violence some mori opinion particularly feminist welcomed the debate on domestic violence that the film enabled well-known mori actors and actresses include temuera morrison cliff curtis lawrence makoare manu bennett and keisha castle-hughes they are in films like whale rider star wars episode iii revenge of the sith the matrix king kong the river queen the lord of the rings rapa nui and others and famous television series like xena warrior princess hercules the legendary journeys the lost world and spartacus blood and sand in most cases their roles in hollywood productions have them portraying ethnic groups other than mori sport mori participate fully in new zealands sporting culture and are well-represented in rugby union rugby league and netball teams at all levels the new zealand national rugby union team performs a haka a traditional mori challenge before international matches as well as participation in national sports teams there are mori rugby union rugby league and cricket representative teams that play in international competitions at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro 41 of the 199 competitors 205 percent were of mori descent in the new zealand delegation with the rugby sevens squads alone having 17 mori competitors out of 24 there were also three competitors of mori descent in the australian delegation ki-o-rahi and tapawai are two sports of mori origin ki-o-rahi got an unexpected boost when mcdonalds chose it to represent new zealand waka ama outrigger canoeing is also popular with mori language from about 1890 mori members of parliament realised the importance of english literacy to mori and insisted that all mori children be taught in english missionaries who still ran many mori schools had been teaching exclusively in mori but the mori mps insisted this should stop however attendance at school for many mori was intermittent the mori language also known as te reo mori pronounced maoi te eo maoi or simply te reo the language has the status of an official language linguists classify it within the eastern polynesian languages as being closely related to cook islands mori tuamotuan and tahitian before european contact mori did not have a written language and important information such as whakapapa was memorised and passed down verbally through the generations mori were familiar with the concept of maps and when interacting with missionaries in 1815 could draw accurate maps of their rohe iwi boundaries onto paper that were the equal of european maps missionaries surmised that mori had traditionally drawn maps on sand or other natural materials in many areas of new zealand mori lost its role as a living community language used by significant numbers of people in the post-war years in tandem with calls for sovereignty and for the righting of social injustices from the 1970s onwards new zealand schools now teach mori culture and language as an option and pre-school kohanga reo language-nests have started which teach tamariki young children exclusively in mori these now extend right through secondary schools kura tuarua most preschool centres teach basics such as colours numerals and greetings in mori songs and chants mori television a government-funded channel committed to broadcasting primarily in te reo began in march 2004 the 1996 census reported 160000 mori speakers at the time of the 2013 census 125352 mori 213 per cent reported a conversational level of proficiency society historical development polynesian settlers in new zealand developed a distinct society over several hundred years social groups were tribal with no unified society or single mori identity until after the arrival of europeans nevertheless common elements could be found in all mori groups in pre-european new zealand including a shared polynesian heritage a common basic language familial associations traditions of warfare and similar mythologies and religious beliefs most mori lived in villages which were inhabited by several whnau extended families who collectively formed a hap clan or subtribe members of a hap cooperated with food production gathering resources raising families and defence mori society across new zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people rangatira chiefs and ruling families tt commoners and mkai slaves tohunga also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts skills and esoteric knowledge shared ancestry intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups many hap with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed iwi or tribes which were the largest social unit in mori society hap and iwi often united for expeditions to gather food and resources or in times of conflict in contrast warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life as different groups competed for food and resources settled personal disputes and sought to increase their prestige and authority the arrival of europeans to new zealand dates back to the 17th century although it was not until the expeditions of james cook over a hundred years later that any meaningful interactions occurred between europeans and mori for mori the new arrivals brought opportunities for trade which many groups embraced eagerly early european settlers introduced tools weapons clothing and foods to mori across new zealand in exchange for resources land and labour mori began selectively adopting elements of western society during the 19th century including european clothing and food and later western education religion and architecture but as the 19th century wore on relations between european colonial settlers and different mori groups became increasingly strained tensions led to conflict in the 1860s and the confiscation of millions of acres of mori land significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the native land court 20th century by the start of the 20th century a greater awareness had emerged of a unified mori identity particularly in comparison to pkeh who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the mori as a whole mori and pkeh societies remained largely separatesocially culturally economically and geographicallyfor much of the 19th and early 20th centuries the key reason for this was that mori remained almost exclusively a rural population whereas increasingly the european population was urban especially after 1900 nevertheless mori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in and ultimately further their incorporation into wider new zealand society the main point of contact with the government were the four mori members of parliament many mori migrated to larger rural towns and cities during the depression and post-wwii periods in search of employment leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban mori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands yet while standards of living improved among mori they continued to lag behind pkeh in areas such as health income skilled employment and access to higher levels of education mori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration including a shortage of housing and jobs and a rise in urban crime poverty and health problems in regards to housing a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of mori and europeans that year out of all the unshared non-mori private dwellings in new zealand 968 per cent had a bath or shower 941 per cent a hot water service 887 per cent a flush toilet 816 per cent a refrigerator and 786 per cent an electric washing machine by contrast for all unshared mori private dwellings that same year 768 per cent had a bath or shower 689 per cent a hot water service 558 per cent a refrigerator 541 per cent a flush toilet and 47 per cent an electric washing machine while the arrival of europeans had a profound impact on the mori way of life many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century mori participate fully in all spheres of new zealand culture and society leading largely western lifestyles while also maintaining their own cultural and social customs the traditional social strata of rangatira tt and mkai have all but disappeared from mori society while the roles of tohunga and kaumtua are still present traditional kinship ties are also actively maintained and the whnau in particular remains an integral part of mori life marae hap and iwi mori society at a local level is particularly visible at the marae formerly the central meeting spaces in traditional villages marae today usually comprise a group of buildings around an open space that frequently host events such as weddings funerals church services and other large gatherings with traditional protocol and etiquette usually observed they also serve as the base of one or sometimes several hap most mori affiliate with one or more iwi and hap based on genealogical descent whakapapa iwi vary in size from a few hundred members to over 100000 in the case of ngpuhi many people do not live in their traditional tribal regions as a result of urban migration iwi are usually governed by rnanga governing councils or trust boards which represent the iwi in consultations and negotiations with the new zealand government rnanga also manage tribal assets and spearhead health education economic and social initiatives to help iwi members socioeconomic challenges mori on average have fewer assets than the rest of the population and run greater risks of many negative economic and social outcomes over 50 per cent of mori live in areas in the three highest deprivation deciles compared with 24 per cent of the rest of the population although mori make up only 14 per cent of the population they make up almost 50 per cent of the prison population mori have higher unemployment-rates than other cultures resident in new zealand mori have higher numbers of suicides than non-mori only 47 per cent of mori school-leavers finish school with qualifications higher than ncea level one compared to 74 per cent european 87 per cent asian although new zealand rates very well globally in the pisa rankings that compare national performance in reading science and maths once you disaggregate the pisa scores pakeha students are second in the world and mori are 34th mori suffer more health problems including higher levels of alcohol and drug abuse smoking and obesity less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to higher levels of morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions such as cervical cancer diabetes per head of population than non-mori although mori life expectancy rates have increased dramatically in the last 50 years they still have considerably lower life-expectancies compared to new zealanders of european ancestry in 2004 mori males lived 690 years vs non-mori males 772 years mori females 732 yrs vs non-mori females 819 years this gap had narrowed by 2013 728 years for men and 765 years for women compared to 802 years for non-mori men and 837 years for non-mori women also a recent study by the new zealand family violence clearinghouse showed that mori women and children are more likely to experience domestic violence than any other ethnic group race relations the status of mori as the indigenous people of new zealand is recognised in new zealand law by the term tangata whenua litpeople of the land which identifies the traditional connection between mori and a given area of land mori as a whole can be considered as tangata whenua of new zealand entirely individual iwi are recognised as tangata whenua for areas of new zealand in which they are traditionally based while hap are tangata whenua within their marae new zealand law periodically requires consultation between the government and tangata whenuafor example during major land development projects this usually takes the form of negotiations between local or national government and the rnanga of one or more relevant iwi although the government generally decides which if any concerns are acted upon mori issues are a prominent feature of race relations in new zealand historically many pkeh viewed race relations in their country as being the best in the world a view that prevailed until mori urban migration in the mid-20th century brought cultural and socioeconomic differences to wider attention mori protest movements grew significantly in the 1960s and 1970s seeking redress for past grievances particularly in regard to land rights successive governments have responded by enacting affirmative action programmes funding cultural rejuvenation initiatives and negotiating tribal settlements for past breaches of the treaty of waitangi further efforts have focused on cultural preservation and reducing socioeconomic disparity nevertheless race relations remains a contentious issue in new zealand society mori advocates continue to push for further redress claiming that their concerns are being marginalised or ignored a 2007 department of corrections report found that mori are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system not only because they commit more crimes but also because they face prejudice at many levels a number of studies have shown evidence of greater likelihood associated only with ethnicity for mori offenders to have police contact be charged lack legal representation not be granted bail plead guilty be convicted be sentenced to non-monetary penalties and be denied release to home detention conversely critics denounce the scale of assistance given to mori as amounting to preferential treatment for a select group of people based on race both sentiments were highlighted during the foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004 in which the new zealand government claimed sole ownership of the new zealand foreshore and seabed over the objections of mori groups who were seeking customary title commerce the new zealand law commission has started a project to develop a legal framework for mori who want to manage communal resources and responsibilities the voluntary system proposes an alternative to existing companies incorporations and trusts in which tribes and hap and other groupings can interact with the legal system the foreshadowed legislation under the proposed name of the waka umanga mori corporations act would provide a model adaptable to suit the needs of individual iwi at the end of 2009 the proposed legislation was awaiting a second hearing wider commercial exposure has increased public awareness of the mori culture but has also resulted in several notable legal disputes between 1998 and 2006 ngti toa attempted to trademark the haka ka mate to prevent its use by commercial organisations without their permission in 2001 danish toymaker lego faced legal action by several mori tribal groups fronted by lawyer maui solomon and members of the

zealand politics since the declaration of the independence of new zealand before the treaty of waitangi was signed in 1840 mori have had reserved seats in the new zealand parliament since 1868 presently this accounts for seven of the 122 seats in new zealands unicameral parliament the contesting of these seats was the first opportunity for many mori to participate in new zealand elections although the elected mori representatives initially struggled to assert significant influence mori received universal suffrage with other new zealand citizens in 1893 being a traditionally tribal people no one organisation ostensibly speaks for all mori nationwide the mori king movement originated in the 1860s as an attempt by several iwi to unify under one leader in modern times it serves a largely ceremonial role another attempt at political unity was the kotahitanga movement which established a separate mori parliament that held annual sessions from 1892 until its last sitting in 1902 there are seven designated mori seats in the new zealand parliament and mori can and do stand in and win general roll seats and consideration of and consultation with mori have become routine requirements for councils and government organisations debate occurs frequently as to the relevance and legitimacy of the mori electoral roll and seats the national party announced in 2008 it would abolish the seats when all historic treaty settlements have been resolved which it aimed to complete by 2014 however after the election national reached an agreement with the mori party not to abolish the seats until mori give their approval several mori political parties have formed over the years to improve the position of mori in new zealand society the present mori party formed in 2004 secured 132 per cent of the party vote at the 2014 general election and held two seats in the 51st new zealand parliament with two mps serving as ministers outside cabinet the party did not achieve any
