lvaro de mendaa y neira or neyra october 1 1542 october 18 1595 was a spanish navigator born in congosto in el bierzo region len he was the nephew of lope garca de castro viceroy of peru he is best known for the two voyages of discovery he led into the pacific in 1567 and 1595 in search of terra australis search for terra australis historian brett hilder has written of ardent spirits in peru inspiring three spanish voyages to the south west pacific in the forty years from 1565 to 1605 one of these ardent spirits was certainly spanish soldier pedro sarmiento de gamboa who arrived in peru in 1557 sarmiento de gamboa developed an interest in inca stories of gold and riches being collected from lands further to the west sarmientos proposal for an expedition to find land in the pacific was put to governor lope garca de castro finding favour as it matched common spanish belief in the existence of a great south land historian miriam estensen argues that governor castro also agreed as a way of maintaining peace and order restless and disruptive elements in the spanish americas were encouraged to join such journeys of exploration to remove them from colonial society the lure of possible wealth made these expeditions attractive to such men often drawn from the poorest levels of society however sarmiento de gamboa was bitterly disappointed not to be made captain-general of the expedition instead command was given to the governor castros nephew the younger and relatively inexperienced lvaro de mendaa de neira sarmiento was to be cosmographer in sarmientos written account he was captain of the flagship and at least on the same level as chief pilot and navigator hernando gallego while sarmientos interest was the riches to be gained mendaas priority was conversion of the heathen to christianity deep divisions had been created within the spanish command even before the expedition departed the first voyage of 1567-1569 the two ships the 200-ton los reyes the capitana or flagship and the 140-ton todos santos the almiranta or secondary ship sailed from callao in peru on 20 november 1567 with about 150 sailors soldiers priests and slaves on board after sighting a small island in mid january probably nui in what is now tuvalu a significant body of land was sighted on february 7 1568 it was santa isabel island where they landed several days later the expedition had discovered the solomon islands which they named islas salomon the spanish immediately came into contact with solomon islanders and at first the relationship was cordial however the spanish expeditions need for fresh food and water quickly led to tension and conflict the solomon islanders subsistence economy being unable to provide continuous supplies to the spanish the real prizes were pigs desperately needed by the spanish while vital to the local peoples economy the cultural gulf was wide in one famous account the spanish were horrified to be offered a quarter of a boy with the arm and hand which the islanders urged mendaa to eat the islanders were offended when the spanish refused after building a small brigantine the surrounding islands of malaita guadalcanal makira which was named san cristobal and choiseul island were explored however the attempts to barter for food led to the same cycle of friendly welcome misunderstandings sullen retreats occasional reconciliations robberies and violent retaliation finally at a council meeting of captains pilots soldiers and sailors on august 7 1568 the decision was made to return to peru mendaa had wanted to sail further south while sarmiento de gamboa and several soldiers unsuccessfully urged the establishment of a colony the two ships sailed north then east passing the marshall islands and wake island before reaching the mexican coast in late january 1569 it was a long and difficult voyage with numerous deaths from scurvy results of the first voyage the main result of the expedition was the discovery of the solomon islands and tuvalu the navigators also gained valuable sailing experience for spain especially in crossing the vast south pacific from peru these discoveries led to successive expeditions in search for terra australis both by mendaa himself and by pedro fernandes de queirs however the great south land had not yet been discovered by europeans the islands found by now popularly called the solomon islands had not revealed more than a few indications of gold there were no spices and the people had not been converted to christianity the 1595-1596 voyage a much larger and costlier expedition had been planned by the early 1590s after mendaa had spent years courting favour in madrid and lima four ships and 378 men women and children were to establish a colony in the solomon islands again the leaders of this voyage had widely divergent personalities mendaa was again in command accompanied by his wife doa isabel barreto her three brothers and a sister chief pilot was to be a young portuguese navigator in spanish service pedro fernandes de queirs an argumentative old soldier pedro merino manrique was chosen as camp master manrique caused disputes before the fleet had even departed the four ships san gernimo the capitana the santa ysabel the almiranta the smaller frigate santa catalina and the galiot san felipe left callao on 9 april 1595 spirits were high in the first month fifteen marriages being celebrated mendaa had queirs prepare charts for his captains that only showed peru and the solomon islands on 21 july 1595 the ships reached the marquesas islands named for the wife of the then viceroy of peru garca hurtado de mendoza 5th marquis of caete to be met by four hundred people in canoes although the spaniards admired their graceful shape and almost white complexion the relationship with the natives later deteriorated when the expedition left two weeks later queirs estimated 200 marquesans had been killed despite mendaas confidence that the solomon islands were nearby it was not until 8 september that they sighted land again this time the island of nendo which they named santa cruz the santa ysabel had disappeared however and despite searches by the two smaller vessels it could not be found arriving at what is now graciosa bay a settlement was commenced relations with local islanders and their chief malope started well with food provided and assistance in constructing buildings however morale amongst the spanish was low and sickness almost certainly malaria was rife manrique was murdered at the orders of and in front of mendaa and shortly afterwards malope was killed by soldiers relations with the islanders soon worsened wracked by internal divisions and an increasing death toll the settlement began to fall apart mendaa himself died on 18 october 1595 leaving his wife as heir and governor her brother lorenzo as captain-general on 30 october the decision was made to abandon the settlement when the three ships departed on 18 november 1595 forty-seven people had died in the space of one month pedro fernandes de queirs is credited with bringing the san gernimo safely into the philippines without the aid of charts arriving in manila bay on 11 february 1596 over fifty people died on the twelve-week voyage from santa cruz in part due to the lack of food supplies and allegedly doa isabels refusal to share out her private store of food and water the frigate carrying mendaas body disappeared during the voyage while the galiot san felipe arrived in the southern end of mindanao several days later aftermath of the 378 who sailed from peru about 100 survived but ten more died shortly after arriving in manila doa isabel barreto was honoured in manila and queirs was commended for his service and absolved of any responsibility for the killings on santa cruz three months later doa isabel married the governors cousin she continued to agitate for a return to the solomon islands she died in 1612 back in peru in june 1597 queirs began his campaign to return to the solomon islands leading the next spanish venture in 1605 this expedition was also unsuccessful but it led to the discovery of the pitcairn islands and vanuatu which were explored and briefly settled in the case of espiritu santo queirs visited the solomons in 1606 but was unable to establish a settlement the solomons were not again visited by outsiders until 1767 when philip carteret sighted santa cruz and malaita islands the story of the voyage is told in the islands of unwisdom a historical novel by robert graves see also pedro fernandes de queirs this
