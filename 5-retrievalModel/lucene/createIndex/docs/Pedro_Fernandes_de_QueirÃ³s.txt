pedro fernandes de queirs spanish pedro fernndez de quirs 15631614 was a portuguese navigator in the service of spain best known for his involvement with spanish voyages of discovery in the pacific ocean in particular the 15951596 voyage of alvaro de mendaa de neira and for leading a 16051606 expedition which crossed the pacific in search of terra australis early life queirs or quirs as he signed was born in vora portugal in 1563 as the portuguese and spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of spain in 1580 following the vacancy of the portuguese throne which lasted for sixty years until 1640 when the portuguese monarchy was restored queirs entered spanish service as a young man and became an experienced seaman and navigator in april 1595 he joined lvaro de mendaa de neira on his voyage to colonise the solomon islands serving as chief pilot after mendaas death in october 1595 he is credited with taking command and saving the only remaining ship of the expedition arriving in the philippines in february 1596 isabel barreto mendaas young wife is often considered to be the cause of the voyages low morale and the eventual failure of the mission she lived a life of luxury in the grand cabin while the crew were fed on meagre rotting rations the story is told in the islands of unwisdom an historic novel by robert graves the search for terra australis queirs spent eighteen months in the philippines but returned to spain in 1598 via mexico upon his return to spain he petitioned king philip iii to support another voyage into the pacific hoping to find a large southern continent to claim for spain a devout catholic queirs also visited rome in 1600 where he obtained the support of the pope clement viii for further explorations he greatly impressed the spanish ambassador in rome the duke of sesa who described him as a man of good judgement experienced in his profession hard working quiet and disinterested while in rome queirs also first wrote his treatise on navigation as a letter to the king further reinforcing his reputation as a navigator and invented two navigational tools in march 1603 queirs was finally authorized to return to peru to establish another expedition with the intention of finding terra australis the mythical great south land and claiming it for spain and the church queirs was shipwrecked in the west indies but made it to peru by march 1605 queirss party of 160 men on three ships san pedro y san pablo 150 tons san pedro 120 tons and the tender or launch los tres reyes left callao on 21 december 1605 in january 1606 the expedition discovered henderson island and ducie island it discovered the buen viaje islands butaritari and makin in the present-day island nation of kiribati it is also probable that his expedition sighted tahiti and other islands in the tuamotu archipelago queirs narrowly missed the marquesas as well as new zealand thanks to a change in his planned itinerary in may 1606 the expedition reached the islands later called the new hebrides and now the independent nation of vanuatu queirs landed on a large island which he took to be part of the southern continent and named it australia del espiritu santo in his printed memorials notably the eighth which was published in italy holland france germany and england this was altered to austrialia del espiritu santo the australian land of the holy spirit a pun on austria to flatter king philip iii who was of the house of austria the island is still called espiritu santo here he stated his intention to establish a colony to be called nova jerusalem he seems to have identified australiaaustrialia del espiritu santo with the huge northward extension of the austral continent joining it to new guinea as depicted in maps like those of gerard de jode and petrus plancius for as he said in his tenth memorial page 5 it should be noted that new guinea is the top end of the austral land of which i treat queirss religious fervour found expression with the founding of a new order of chivalry the knights of the holy ghost the orders purpose was to protect the new colony however within weeks the idea of a colony was abandoned due to the hostility of the ni-vanuatu and to disagreements among the crew after six weeks queirss ships put to sea to explore the coastline on the night of june 11 1606 queirs in the san pedro y san pablo became separated from the other ships in bad weather and was unable or so he later said to return to safe anchorage at espiritu santo he then sailed to acapulco in mexico where he arrived in november 1606 in the account of diego de prado y tovar which is highly critical of queirs mutiny and poor leadership is given as the reason for queirss disappearance two weeks later his second-in-command luis vez de torres after searching in vain for queirs and assuming his ship was wrecked left espiritu santo torres successfully reached manila the center of the spanish east indies in may 1607 after charting the southern coastline of new guinea on the way and in doing so sailing through the strait that now bears his name between australia and new guinea torres was unaware of his proximity to australias northern coast just over the horizon from his route later life pedro de queirs returned to madrid in 1607 regarded as a crank he spent the next seven years in poverty writing numerous accounts of his voyage and begging king philip iii for money for a new voyage sending the king more than 65 letters over a seven-year period he was finally despatched to peru with letters of support but the king had no real intention of funding another expedition as the royal council feared that spain could not afford new discoveries in the pacific queirs died on the way in panama in 1614 he had married dona ana chacon of madrid in 1589 the couple had one son and one daughter accounts of queirss voyage there are a number of documents describing the queirs torres voyages still in existence most significant are quirs many subsequent memorials to the king philip iii regarding the voyage torres brief account to the king 1607 prado y tobar narrative relacion sumaria del del descubrimto que enpeco pero fernandez de quiros which is a valuable supplement to the letter of torres written to the king of spain on 12 july 1607 prados narrative is the only record apart from the letter to cover the voyage to manila four charts of new guinea juan luis arias de loyolas memorial to king philip iv written about 1630 and based on discussions between queirs and loyola most documents of luis vez de torress discoveries were not published but filed away in spanish archives including prados lengthy account and accompanying charts some time between 1762 and 1765 written accounts of the torres expedition were seen by british admiralty hydrographer alexander dalrymple dalrymple provided a sketch map which included the queirs -torres voyages to joseph banks who undoubtedly passed this information to james cook memorials queirs sent at least 50 possibly 65 memorials to the king between 1607 and 1614 although most were written manuscripts queirs paid to have fourteen printed and presented to the king copies of thirteen of these memorials are known to have survived scholars have numbered these memorials in different ways according to the memorials available to them for study and those publicly known at the time 1617 may be the date of the first english translation of one of queirss memorials as terra australis incognita or a new southerne discoverie a short account of queirss voyage and discoveries was published in english by samuel purchas in 1625 in haklvytvs posthumus or pvrchas his pilgrimes vol iv p1422-1432 this account also appears to be based on a letter by queirs to the king in 1610 the eighth on the matter the table below gives a summary of the memorials including the classification systems used by four different scholars celsus kelly in 1965 frances mary hellessey dunn in 1961 justo zaragoza in 1876 and phyllis mander-jones in 1930 theory that queirs discovered australia in the 19th century some australian catholics claimed that queirs had in fact discovered australia in advance of the protestants willem janszoon abel tasman and james cook the archbishop of sydney from 1884 to 1911 patrick francis moran asserted this to be a fact and it was taught in catholic schools for many years he claimed that the real site of queirss new jerusalem was near gladstone in queensland supported by elements of queirss description of the land he had discovered such as his assertion that its length is as much as all europe and asia minor as far as the caspian and persia with all the islands of the mediterranean and the ocean which encompasses including the two islands of england and ireland that hidden part is one-fourth of the world queirs in modern literature james mcauley 1964 building on this tradition the australian poet james mcauley 191776 wrote an epic called captain quiros 1964 in which he depicted queirs as a martyr for the cause of catholic christian civilisation although he did not repeat the claim that queirs had discovered australia the heavily political overtones of the poem caused it to be coldly received at a time when much politics in australia was still coloured by catholic-protestant sectarianism the australian writer john toohey published a novel quiros in 2002 the british writer robert graves describes the 1595 expedition in his historical novel the islands
