before humans went into space several other animals were launched into space including numerous other primates so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of space travel the united states launched flights containing primate passengers primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985 france launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967 the soviet union and russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996 most primates were anesthetized before lift-off overall thirty-two monkeys flew in the space program none flew more than once numerous backup monkeys also went through the programs but never flew monkeys and apes from several species were used including rhesus macaque crab-eating macaque squirrel monkeys pig-tailed macaques and chimpanzees united states the first primate astronaut was albert a rhesus macaque who on june 11 1948 rode to over 63km 39mi on a v-2 rocket albert died of suffocation during the flight albert was followed by albert ii who survived the v-2 flight but died on impact on june 14 1949 after a parachute failure albert ii became the first monkey and the first primate in space as his flight reached 134km 83mi - past the krmn line of 100km taken to designate the beginning of space albert iii died at 35000 feet 107km in an explosion of his v2 on september 16 1949 albert iv on the last monkey v-2 flight died on impact on december 8 that year after another parachute failure his flight reached 1306 km alberts i ii and iv were rhesus macaque while albert iii was a crab-eating macaque monkeys later flew on aerobee rockets on april 18 1951 a monkey possibly called albert v died due to parachute failure yorick also called albert vi along with 11 mouse crewmates reached 236000ft 72km 447mi and survived the landing on september 20 1951 the first monkey to do so the dogs dezik and tsygan had survived a trip to space in july of that year although he died 2 hours later two of the mice also died after recovery all of the deaths were thought to be related to stress from overheating in the sealed capsule in the new mexico sun while awaiting the recovery team albert vis flight surpassed the 50-mile boundary the us used for spaceflight but was below the international definition of space patricia and mike two cynomolgus monkeys flew on may 21 1952 and survived but their flight was only to 26 kilometers on december 13 1958 gordo also called old reliable a squirrel monkey survived being launched aboard jupiter am-13 by the us army he was killed due to mechanical failure of the parachute recovery system in the rocket nose cone on may 28 1959 aboard the jupiter am-18 able a rhesus macaque and miss baker a squirrel monkey flew a successful mission able was born at the ralph mitchell zoo in independence kansas they travelled in excess of 16000kmh and withstood 38 g 373ms able died june 1 1959 while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode from a reaction to the anesthesia baker became the first monkey to survive the stresses of spaceflight and the related medical procedures baker died november 29 1984 at the age of 27 and is buried on the grounds of the united states space rocket center in huntsville alabama able was preserved and is now on display at the smithsonian institutions national air and space museum their names were taken from the 1943-1955 us military phonetic alphabet on december 4 1959 sam a rhesus macaque flew on the little joe 2 in the mercury program to 53 miles high miss sam also a rhesus macaque followed in 1960 on little joe 1b although her flight was only to 8mi 13km in a test of emergency procedures ham and enos also flew in the mercury program but they were chimpanzees the names sam and ham were acronyms sam was named in homage to the school of aerospace medicine at brooks air force base in san antonio texas the name ham was taken from holloman aerospace medicine at holloman air force base new mexico goliath a squirrel monkey died in the explosion of his atlas rocket on november 10 1961 a rhesus macaque called scatback flew a sub-orbital flight on december 20 1961 but was lost at sea after landing bonny a pig-tailed macaque flew on biosatellite 3 a mission which lasted from june 29 to july 8 1969 this was the first multi-day monkey flight but came after longer human spaceflights were common he died within a day of landing spacelab 3 on the space shuttle flight sts-51-b featured two squirrel monkeys named no 3165 and no 384-80 the flight was from april 29 to may 6 1985 france france launched a pig-tailed macaque named martine on a vesta rocket on march 7 1967 and another named pierette on march 13 these suborbital flights reached 243km 151mi and 234km 145mi respectively martine became the first monkey to survive more than a couple of hours after flying above the international definition of the edge of space ham and enos launched earlier by the united states had been chimpanzees soviet union and russia the soviet russian space program used only rhesus macaques in its bion satellite program in 1980s and 1990s the names of the monkeys began with sequential letters of the russian alphabet the animals all survived their missions but for a single fatality in post-flight surgery after which the program was cancelled the first monkeys launched by soviet space program abrek and bion flew on bion 6 they remained aloft from december 14 1983 december 20 1983 next came bion 7 with monkeys verny and gordy from july 10 1985 july 17 1985 then dryoma and yerosha on bion 8 from september 29 1987 october 12 1987 after returning from space dryoma was presented to cuban leader fidel castro bion 9 with monkeys zhakonya and zabiyaka followed from september 15 1989 to september 28 1989 the two took the space endurance record for monkeys at 13 days 17 hours in space monkeys krosh and ivasha flew on bion 10 from december 29 1992 to january 7 1993 krosh produced offspring after rehabilitation upon returning to earth lapik and multik were the last monkeys in space until iran launched one of its own in 2013 the pair flew aboard bion 11 from december 24 1996 to january 7 1997 upon return multik died while under anesthesia for us biopsy sampling on january 8 lapik nearly died while undergoing the identical procedure no follow-up research has been conducted to determine whether these two incidents together with the 1959 loss of the us monkey able in post-flight surgery contraindicate the administration of anesthesia during or shortly after spaceflights further us support of the bion program was cancelled argentina on december 23 1969 as part of the operacin navidad operation christmas argentina launched juan a tufted capuchin native to argentinas misiones province using a two-stage rigel 04 rocket it ascended perhaps up to 82 kilometers and then was recovered successfully other sources give 30 60 or 72 kilometers all of these are below the international definition of space 100km later on the february 1 1970 the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a x-1 panther rocket although it reached a higher altitude than its predecessor it was lost after the capsules parachute failed china the prc spacecraft shenzhou 2 launched on january 9 2001 inside the reentry module precise information is lacking due to the secrecy surrounding chinas space program a monkey dog and rabbit rode aloft in a test of the spacecrafts life support systems the sz2 reentry module landed in inner mongolia on january 16 no images of the recovered capsule appeared in the press leading to the widespread inference that the flight ended in failure according to press reports citing an unnamed source a parachute connection malfunction caused a hard landingcheng ho february 27 2001 confusion and mystery of shenzhou 2 mission deepens spacedaily retrieved 2010-12-13 iran on january 28 2013 afp and sky news reported that iran had sent a monkey in a pishgam rocket to a height of 72 miles 116km and retrieved shipment iranian media gave no details on the timing or location of the launch while details that were reported raised questions about the claim pre-flight and post-flight photos clearly showed different monkeys the confusion was due to the publishing of an archive photo from 2011 by the iranian student news agency isna according to jonathan mcdowell a harvard astronomer they just mixed that footage with the footage of the 2013 successful launch on december 14 2013 afp and bbc reported that iran again sent a monkey to space and safely returned it rhesus macaque aftab 20130128 and fargam 20131214 were each launched separately into space and safely returned researchers continue to study the effects of the space trip on their offspring see also
