ida ad minor planet designation 243 ida is an asteroid in the koronis family of the asteroid belt it was discovered on 29 september 1884 by austrian astronomer johann palisa at vienna observatory and named after a nymph from greek mythology later telescopic observations categorized ida as an s-type asteroid the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt on 28 august 1993 ida was visited by the unmanned galileo spacecraft while en route to jupiter it was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite idas orbit lies between the planets mars and jupiter like all main-belt asteroids its orbital period is 484 years and its rotation period is 463 hours ida has an average diameter of 314km 195mi it is irregularly shaped and elongated apparently composed of two large objects connected together its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the solar system featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages idas moon dactyl was discovered by mission member ann harch in images returned from galileo it was named after the dactyls creatures which inhabited mount ida in greek mythology dactyl is only 14 kilometres 4600ft in diameter about 120 the size of ida its orbit around ida could not be determined with much accuracy but the constraints of possible orbits allowed a rough determination of idas density and revealed that it is depleted of metallic minerals dactyl and ida share many characteristics suggesting a common origin the images returned from galileo and the subsequent measurement of idas mass provided new insights into the geology of s-type asteroids before the galileo flyby many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the earth and their origin in the asteroid belt data returned from the flyby pointed to s-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites the most common type found on the earths surface discovery and observations ida was discovered on 29 september 1884 by austrian astronomer johann palisa at the vienna observatory it was his 45th asteroid discovery ida was named by moriz von kuffner a viennese brewer and amateur astronomer in greek mythology ida was a nymph of crete who raised the god zeus ida was recognized as a member of the koronis family by kiyotsugu hirayama who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body idas reflection spectrum was measured on 16 september 1980 by astronomers david j tholen and edward f tedesco as part of the eight-color asteroid survey ecas its spectrum matched those of the asteroids in the s-type classification many observations of ida were made in early 1993 by the us naval observatory in flagstaff and the oak ridge observatory these improved the measurement of idas orbit around the sun and reduced the uncertainty of its position during the galileo flyby from 78 to 60km 48 to 37mi exploration galileo flyby ida was visited in 1993 by the jupiter-bound space probe galileo its encounters of the asteroids gaspra and ida were secondary to the jupiter mission these were selected as targets in response to a new nasa policy directing mission planners to consider asteroid flybys for all spacecraft crossing the belt no prior missions had attempted such a flyby galileo was launched into orbit by the space shuttle atlantis mission sts-34 on 18 october 1989 changing galileos trajectory to approach ida required that it consume 34kg 75lb of propellant mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were certain that this would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its jupiter mission galileos trajectory carried it into the asteroid belt twice on its way to jupiter during its second crossing it flew by ida on 28 august 1993 at a speed of 12400ms 41000fts relative to the asteroid the onboard imager observed ida from a distance of 240350km 149350mi to its closest approach of 2390km 1490mi ida was the second asteroid after gaspra to be imaged by a spacecraft about 95 of idas surface came into view of the probe during the flyby transmission of many ida images was delayed due to a permanent failure in the spacecrafts high-gain antenna the first five images were received in september 1993 these comprised a high-resolution mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 3138mpixel the remaining images were sent in february 1994 when the spacecrafts proximity to the earth allowed higher speed transmissions discoveries the data returned from the galileo flybys of gaspra and ida and the later near shoemaker asteroid mission permitted the first study of asteroid geology idas relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features the discovery of idas moon dactyl the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid provided additional insights into idas composition ida is classified as an s-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements the composition of s-types was uncertain before the galileo flybys but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the earth ordinary chondrite oc and stony-iron estimates of idas density are constrained to less than 32gcm by the long-term stability of dactyls orbit this all but rules out a stony-iron composition were ida made of 5gcm iron- and nickel-rich material it would have to contain more than 40 empty space the galileo images also led to the discovery that space weathering was taking place on ida a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time the same process affects both ida and its moon although dactyl shows a lesser change the weathering of idas surface revealed another detail about its composition the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of oc meteorites but the older regions matched the spectra of s-type asteroids both of these discoveriesthe space weathering effects and the low densityled to a new understanding about the relationship between s-type asteroids and oc meteorites s-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt oc meteorites are likewise the most common type of meteorite found on the earths surface the reflection spectra measured by remote observations of s-type asteroids however did not match that of oc meteorites the galileo flyby of ida found that some s-types particularly the koronis family could be the source of these meteorites physical characteristics idas mass is between 365 and 49910kg its gravitational field produces an acceleration of about 03 to 11cms over its surface this field is so weak that an astronaut standing on its surface could leap from one end of ida to the other and an object moving in excess of 20ms 70fts could escape the asteroid entirely ida is a distinctly elongated asteroid with an irregular surface ida is 235 times as long as it is wide and a waist separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves this constricted shape is consistent with ida being made of two large solid components with loose debris filling the gap between them however no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by galileo although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50 on ida the slope generally does not exceed 35 idas irregular shape is responsible for the asteroids very uneven gravitational field the surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed it is also low near the waist because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves away from this location surface features idas surface appears heavily cratered and mostly gray although minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas besides craters other features are evident such as grooves ridges and protrusions ida is covered by a thick layer of regolith loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath the largest boulder-sized debris fragments are called ejecta blocks several of which have been observed on the surface regolith the surface of ida is covered in a blanket of pulverized rock called regolith about 50100m 160330ft thick this material is produced in impact events and redistributed across idas surface by geological processes galileo observed evidence of recent downslope regolith movement idas regolith is composed of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering because of this process older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material about 20 large 40150m across ejecta blocks have been identified embedded in idas regolith ejecta blocks constitute the largest pieces of the regolith because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event most of them are located within the craters lascaux and mammoth but they may not have been produced there this area attracts debris due to idas irregular gravitational field some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater azzurra on the opposite side of the asteroid structures several major structures mark idas surface the asteroid appears to be split into two halves here referred to as region 1 and region 2 connected by a waist this feature may have been filled in by debris or blasted out of the asteroid by impacts region 1 of ida contains two major structures one is a prominent 40km 25mi ridge named townsend dorsum that stretches 150 degrees around idas surface the other structure is a large indentation named vienna regio idas region 2 features several sets of grooves most of which are 100m 330ft wide or less and up to 4km 25mi long they are located near but are not connected with the craters mammoth lascaux and kartchner some grooves are related to major impact events for example a set opposite vienna regio craters ida is one of the most densely cratered bodies yet explored in the solar system and impacts have been the primary process shaping its surface cratering has reached the saturation point meaning that new impacts erase evidence of old ones leaving the total crater count roughly the same it is covered with craters of all sizes and stages of degradation and ranging in age from fresh to as old as ida itself the oldest may have been formed during the breakup of the koronis family parent body the largest crater lascaux is almost 12km 75mi across region 2 contains nearly all of the craters larger than 6km 37mi in diameter but region 1 has no large craters at all some craters are arranged in chains idas major craters are named after caves and lava tubes on earth the crater azzurra for example is named after a submerged cave on the island of capri also known as the blue grotto azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on ida the ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface an exception to the crater morphology is the fresh asymmetric fingal which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side another significant crater is afon which marks idas prime meridian the craters are simple in structure bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks they are distributed evenly around ida except for a protrusion north of crater choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered the ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation low gravity and irregular shape ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost composition ida was classified as an s-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids s-types may share their composition with stony-iron or ordinary chondrite oc meteorites the composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed but is assumed to be similar to oc material based on observed surface color changes and idas bulk density of 227310 gcm oc meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene iron and feldspar olivine and pyroxene were detected on ida by galileo the mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent galileo found minimal variations on the surface and the asteroids spin indicates a consistent density assuming that its composition is similar to oc meteorites which range in density from 348 to 364 gcm ida would have a porosity of 1142 idas interior probably contains some amount of impact-fractured rock called megaregolith the megaregolith layer of ida extends between hundreds of meters below the surface to a few kilometers some rock in idas core may have been fractured below the large craters mammoth lascaux and undara orbit and rotation ida is a member of the koronis family of asteroid-belt asteroids ida orbits the sun at an average distance of 2862au 4281gm between the orbits of mars and jupiter ida takes 484089 years to complete one orbit idas rotation period is 463 hours making it one of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered the calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid this suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid idas axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years due to the gravity of the sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid origin ida originated in the breakup of the roughly 120km 75mi diameter koronis parent body the progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated with heavier metals migrating to the core ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material it is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred according to an analysis of idas cratering processes its surface is more than a billion years old however this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the idadactyl system of less than 100 million years it is unlikely that dactyl due to its small size could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer the difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the koronis parent bodys destruction moon ida has a moon named dactyl official designation 243 ida i dactyl dktl dak-til it was discovered in images taken by the galileo spacecraft during its flyby in 1993 these images provided the first direct confirmation of an asteroid moon at the time it was separated from ida by a distance of 90 kilometres 56mi moving in a prograde orbit dactyl is heavily cratered like ida and consists of similar materials its origin is uncertain but evidence from the flyby suggests that it originated as a fragment of the koronis parent body discovery dactyl was found on 17 february 1994 by galileo mission member ann harch while examining delayed image downloads from the spacecraft galileo recorded 47 images of dactyl over an observation period of 55 hours in august 1993 the spacecraft was 10760 kilometres 6690mi from ida and 10870 kilometres 6750mi from dactyl when the first image of the moon was captured 14 minutes before galileo made its closest approach dactyl was initially designated 1993 243 1 it was named by the international astronomical union in 1994 for the mythological dactyls who inhabited mount ida on the island of crete physical characteristics dactyl is an egg-shaped but remarkably spherical object measuring 16 by 14 by 12 kilometres 099mi 087mi 075mi it was oriented with its longest axis pointing towards ida like ida dactyls surface exhibits saturation cratering it is marked by more than a dozen craters with a diameter greater than 80m 260ft indicating that the moon has suffered many collisions during its history at least six craters form a linear chain suggesting that it was caused by locally produced debris possibly ejected from ida dactyls craters may contain central peaks unlike those found on ida these features and dactyls spheroidal shape imply that the moon is gravitationally controlled despite its small size like ida its average temperature is about 200k 73c 100f dactyl shares many characteristics with ida their albedos and reflection spectra are very similar the small differences indicate that the space weathering process is less active on dactyl its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible this contrasts with ida which is covered by a deep layer of regolith the two largest imaged craters on dactyl were named acmon and celmis after two of the mythological dactyls acmon is the largest crater in the above image and celmis is near the bottom mostly obscured in shadow the craters are 300 and 200 meters in diameter respectively orbit dactyls orbit around ida is not precisely known galileo was in the plane of dactyls orbit when most of the images were taken which made determining its exact orbit difficult dactyl orbits in the prograde direction and is inclined about 8 to idas equator based on computer simulations dactyls pericenter must be more than about 65km 40mi from ida for it to remain in a stable orbit the range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which galileo observed dactyl to be at 165205 ut on 28 august 1993 about 90km 56mi from ida at longitude 85 on 26 april 1994 the hubble space telescope observed ida for eight hours and was unable to spot dactyl it would have been able to observe it if it were more than about 700km 430mi from ida if in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen dactyls orbital period would be about 20 hours its orbital speed is roughly 10ms 33fts about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball age and origin dactyl may have originated at the same time as ida from the disruption of the koronis parent body however it may have formed more recently perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on ida it is extremely unlikely that it was captured by ida dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago which reduced its size see also list of geological features on 243 ida and dactyl list of minor planets notes journal articles books other asteroids with satellites robert
