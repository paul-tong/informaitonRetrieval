flight controllers are personnel who aid space flight by working in such mission control centers as nasas mission control center or esas european space operations centre flight controllers work at computer consoles and use telemetry to monitor various technical aspects of a space mission in real time each controller is an expert in a specific area and constantly communicates with additional experts in the back room the flight director who leads the flight controllers monitors the activities of a team of flight controllers and has overall responsibility for success and safety this article primarily discusses nasas flight controllers at the johnson space center jsc in houston the various national and commercial flight control facilities have their own teams which may be described on their own pages nasas flight controllers the room where the flight controllers work was called the mission operations control room mocr pronounced moh-ker and now is called the flight control room fcr pronounced ficker the controllers are experts in individual systems and make recommendations to the flight director involving their areas of responsibility any controller may call for an abort if the circumstances require it before significant events the flight director will go around the room polling each controller for a gono go decision a procedure also known as a launch status check if all factors are good each controller calls for a go but if there is a problem requiring a hold or an abort the call is no go another form of this is stayno stay when the spacecraft has completed a maneuver and has now parked in relation to another body including spacecraft orbiting the earth or the moon or the lunar landings controllers in mocrfcr are supported by the backrooms teams of flight controllers located in other parts of the building or even at remote facilities the backroom was formally called the staff support room ssr and is now called the multi-purpose support room mpsr pronounced mipser backroom flight controllers are responsible for the details of their assigned system and for making recommendations for actions needed for that system frontroom flight controllers are responsible for integrating the needs of their system into the larger needs of the vehicle and working with the rest of the flight control team to develop a cohesive plan of action even if that plan is not necessarily in the best interests of the system they are responsible for within the chain of command of the mcc information and recommendations flow from the backroom to the frontroom to flight and then potentially to the onboard crew generally a mocrfcr flight control team is made up of the more seasoned flight controllers than the ssrmpsr though senior flight controllers cycle back to support in the backroom periodically one example of the usefulness of this system occurred during the descent of the apollo 11 lunar module eagle when 1202 and 1201 program alarms came from the lm guido steve bales not sure whether to call for an abort trusted the experts in the guidance backroom especially jack garman who told him that the problem was a computer overload but could be ignored if it was intermittent bales called go flight director gene kranz accepted the call and the mission continued to success without the support of the backroom a controller might make a bad call based on faulty memory or information not readily available to the person on the console the nature of quiescent operations aboard the international space station iss today is such that the full team is not required for 247365 support fcr flight controllers accept responsibility for operations without mpsr support most of the time and the mpsr is only staffed for high-intensity periods of activity such as joint shuttleiss missions the flight controllers in the fcr and mpsr are further supported by hardware and software designers analysts and engineering specialists in other parts of the building or remote facilities these extended support teams have more detailed analysis tools and access to development and test data that is not readily accessible to the flight control team these support teams were referred to by the name of their room in mission control the mission operations integration room moir and are now collectively referred to by the name of their current location the mission evaluation room mer while the flight controllers and their backrooms are responsible for real-time decision making the moirmer provides the detailed data and history needed to solve longer-term issues unmanned us space missions also have flight controllers but are managed from separate organizations either the jet propulsion laboratory or the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory for deep-space missions or goddard space flight center for near-earth missions each flight controller has a unique call sign which describes the positions responsibilities the call sign and responsibility refer to the particular console not just the person since missions are managed around the clock and with each shift change a different person takes over the console flight controller responsibilities have changed over time and continue to evolve new controllers are added and tasks are reassigned to other controllers to keep up with changing technical systems for example the eecom handled command and service module communication systems through apollo 10 which was afterward assigned to a new position called inco responsibility flight controllers are responsible for the success of the mission and for the lives of the astronauts under their watch the flight controllers creed states that they must always be aware that suddenly and unexpectedly we may find ourselves in a role where our performance has ultimate consequences well-known actions taken by flight controllers include the apollo 11 lunar module computer was overloaded because the astronauts forgot to switch off their upper-stage radar before switching on the downward-pointing radar guidance officer steve bales had only a few seconds to determine whether it was safe to land anyway or to abort the mission mere feet above the moon bales was later honored for his role in the mission when he was selected to accept the nasa group achievement award from president richard nixon on behalf of the apollo 11 mission operations team during the launch of apollo 12 the saturn v was struck by lightning which knocked out all telemetry and multiple command module systems seconds before mission abort eecom controller john aaron determined that switching to the backup electrical power distribution telemetry conditioning would reveal the true nature of the issue during space shuttle mission sts-51-f a main engine failed during ascent to orbit subsequently indications were received of a second engine beginning to fail which would have caused a mission abort possibly including loss of the shuttle booster officer jenny howard stein determined that the anomalous readings on the second engine were a sensor error and not an engine problem at her direction the crew inhibited the sensor which saved the mission and possibly the crew common flight control positions there are some positions that have and will serve the same function in every vehicles flight control team the group of individuals serving in those positions may be different but they will be called the same thing and serve the same function flight director leads the flight control team flight has overall operational responsibility for missions and payload operations and for all decisions regarding safe expedient flight this person monitors the other flight controllers remaining in constant verbal communication with them via intercom channels called loops flight operations directorate fod is a representative of the senior management chain at jsc and is there to help the flight director make those decisions that have no safety-of-flight consequences but may have cost or public perception consequences the fod cannot overrule the flight director during a mission the former mission operations directorate mod position was renamed fod when the flight crew operations directorate fcod was merged back with mod beginning in august 2014 spacecraft communicator capcom generally only the spacecraft communicator communicates directly with the crew of a crewed space flight the acronym dates back to project mercury when the spacecraft was originally termed a capsule nasa felt it important for all communication with the astronauts in space to pass through a single individual in the mission control center that role was first designated the capsule communicator or capcom and was filled by another astronaut often one of the backup- or support-crew members nasa believes that an astronaut is most able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and pass information in the clearest way for long-duration missions there is more than one capcom each assigned to a different shift team after control of us spaceflights moved to the lyndon b johnson space center in the early 1960s each capcom used the radio call-sign houston when non-astronauts are communicating directly with the spacecraft capcom acts as the communications controller as of 2011 due to the shrinking size of the astronaut corps at the end of the shuttle program fewer astronauts are available to perform capcom duties so non-astronauts from the space flight training and flight controller branches also function as capcom during iss missions while the role was filled solely by astronauts for the apollo and shuttle missions astronauts still take the capcom position during critical events such as docking and eva in the context of potential manned missions to mars nasa ames research center has conducted field trials of advanced computer-support for astronaut and remote science teams to test the possibilities for automating capcom flight surgeon the flight surgeon directs all medical activities during the mission monitors crew health via telemetry provides crew consultation and advises the flight director a private communication channel can be established between astronauts and the flight surgeon to provide doctorpatient confidentiality public affairs officer pao provides mission commentary to supplement and explain air-to-ground transmissions and flight control operations to the news media and the public the individual filling this role is often referred to colloquially as the voice of mission control apollo flight control positions the flight control positions used during the apollo era were predominantly identical to the positions used for the mercury and gemini vehicles this was because of the similarity of the vehicle design of the capsules used for the three programs booster systems engineer the booster systems engineer monitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent during the apollo program there were three booster positions who worked only until trans-lunar injection tli after that their consoles were vacated booster had the power to send an abort command to the spacecraft all booster technicians were employed at the marshall space flight center and reported to jsc for the launches control officer the control officer was responsible for the lunar module guidance navigation and control systems essentially the equivalent of the gnc for the lunar module electrical environmental and consumables manager eecom the eecom monitored cryogenic levels for fuel cells and cabin cooling systems electrical distribution systems cabin pressure control systems and vehicle lighting systems eecom originally stood for electrical environmental and communication systems the apollo eecom was responsible for csm communications through apollo 10 afterward the communication task was moved to a new console named inco perhaps the most famous nasa eecoms are seymour sy liebergot the eecom on duty at the time of the oxygen tank explosion on apollo 13 and john aaron who designed the drastically-reduced power budget for its return aaron also saved the apollo 12 mission by realizing that using the backup power supply for telemetry of analog capsule sensors would allow diagnosis of all the seemingly-unrelated problems caused by a lightning strike flight activities officer fao the fao planned and supported crew activities checklists procedures and schedules flight director the flight directors held overall control of all of the individual positions in the mocr some apollo era directors were gene kranz white flight apollo missions 7 9 11 13 15 16 and 17 glynn lunney black flight apollo missions 7 8 10 11 13 14 and 15 gerry griffin gold flight apollo missions 7 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 and 17 milt windler maroon flight apollo missions 8 10 12 13 14 and 15 cliff charlesworth green flight apollo missions 8 11 and 12 m p pete frank orange flight apollo missions 12 16 and 17 flight dynamics officer fdo or fido responsible for the flight path of the space vehicle both atmospheric and orbital during lunar missions the fdo was also responsible for the lunar trajectory the fdo monitored vehicle performance during the powered flight phase and assessed abort modes calculated orbital maneuvers and resulting trajectories and monitored vehicle flight profile and energy levels during reentry guidance officer guidance or guido the guidance officer monitored onboard navigational systems and onboard guidance computer software responsible for determining the position of the spacecraft in space one well-known guidance officer was steve bales who gave the go call when the apollo 11 guidance computer came close to overloading during the first lunar descent guidance navigation and controls systems engineer gnc the gnc monitored all vehicle guidance navigation and control systems also responsible for propulsion systems such as the service propulsion system and reaction control system rcs integrated communications officer inco the inco was responsible for all data voice and video communications systems including monitoring the configuration of in-flight communications and instrumentation systems duties also included monitoring the telemetry link between the vehicle and the ground and overseeing the uplink command and control processes the position was formed from the combination of lem and csm communicator positions network supervised the network of ground stations that relayed telemetry and communications from the spacecraft organization and procedures officer op supervised the application of mission rules and established techniques to the conduct of the flight retrofire officer retro drew up abort plans and was responsible for determination of retrofire times during lunar missions the retro planned and monitored trans earth injection tei maneuvers where the apollo service module fired its engine to return to earth from the moon telemetry electrical eva mobility unit officer telmu monitored the lunar module electrical and environmental systems plus lunar astronaut spacesuits essentially the equivalent of the eecom for the lunar module shuttle and space station flight controllers nasa currently has a group of flight controllers at the johnson space center in houston for the international space station iss the space shuttle flight control team as well as those for the earlier gemini apollo and skylab programs were also based there console manning for short-duration and extended operations differed in operational philosophy the space shuttle and prior program flight controllers worked relatively brief periods the several minutes of ascent the few days the vehicle was in orbit and reentry the duration of operations for space shuttle flight controllers was short and time-critical a failure on the shuttle could leave flight controllers little time for talking putting pressure on them to respond quickly to potential failures the space shuttle flight controllers generally had limited capability to send commands to the shuttle for system reconfigurations in contrast the iss flight controllers work 24 hours a day 365 days a year this allows the iss flight controllers time to discuss off-nominal telemetry the iss flight controllers have the opportunity to interface with many groups and engineering experts the mentality of an iss flight controller is to preempt a failure telemetry is closely monitored for any signatures that may begin to indicate future catastrophic failures generally iss flight controllers take a prophylactic approach to space vehicle operations there are command capabilities that iss flight controllers use to preclude a potential failure shuttle flight control positions many apollo program mission control positions were carried forward to the space shuttle program however other positions were eliminated or redefined and new positions were added positions remaining generally the same booster fao fdo guidance became guidance and procedures officer or gpo gnc inco became instrumentation and communications

few members of shuttle mission control not physically present in houston if an emergency had occurred such as loss of one or more main engine during a space shuttle launch requiring the shuttle to land at one of the contingency landing sites in africa europe or the middle east talcom would have assumed the role of capcom providing communications with astronauts aboard the crippled orbiter like capcom the talcom role was filled by an astronaut three astronauts were deployed to the alternate landing sites in zaragoza air base and moron air base in spain and istres air base in france these astronauts flew aboard weather reconnaissance aircraft to provide support at the selected landing site iss flight control positions to 2010 the international space station flight control positions used by nasa in houston are different from those used by previous nasa programs these differences exist primarily to stem the potential confusion that might otherwise follow from conflicting use of the same name in two different rooms during the same operations such as when the space shuttle was conducting mated operations with the space station there are also differences in the control positions because of differences in the operation of the two the following is a list of those flight controllers located in mission control center houston there are several other control centers which house dozens of other flight controllers that support the vastly complex vehicle positions formerly used but eliminated or modified assembly and checkout officer aco retired position at end of shuttle
