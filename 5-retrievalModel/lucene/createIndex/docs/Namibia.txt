and angola to the north botswana to the east and south africa to the south and east although it does not border zimbabwe less than 200 metres of the zambezi river essentially a small bulge in botswana to achieve a botswanazambia micro-border separates the two countries namibia gained independence from south africa on 21 march 1990 following the namibian war of independence its capital and largest city is windhoek and it is a member state of the united nations un the southern african development community sadc the african union au and the commonwealth of nations namibia the driest country in sub-saharan africa was inhabited since early times by the san damara and nama peoples around the 14th century immigrating bantu peoples arrived as part of the bantu expansion since then the bantu groups one of which is known as the ovambo people have dominated the population of the country since the late 19th century they have constituted a majority in 1878 the cape of good hope then a british colony had annexed the port of walvis bay and the offshore penguin islands these became an integral part of the new union of south africa at its creation in 1910 in 1884 the german empire established rule over most of the territory as a protectorate schutzgebiet it began to develop infrastructure and farming and maintained this german colony until 1915 when south african forces defeated its military in 1920 after the end of world war i the league of nations mandated the country to the united kingdom under administration by south africa it imposed its laws including racial classifications and rules from 1948 with the national party elected to power south africa applied apartheid also to what was then known as south west africa in the later 20th century uprisings and demands for political representation by native african political activists seeking independence resulted in the un assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966 but south africa maintained de facto rule in 1973 the un recognised the south west africa peoples organisation swapo as the official representative of the namibian people the party is dominated by the ovambo who are a large plurality in the territory following continued guerrilla warfare south africa installed an interim administration in namibia in 1985 namibia obtained full independence from south africa in 1990 however walvis bay and the penguin islands remained under south african control until 1994 namibia has a population of 26million people and a stable multi-party parliamentary democracy agriculture herding tourism and the mining industry including mining for gem diamonds uranium gold silver and base metals form the basis of its economy the large arid namib desert has resulted in namibia being overall one of the least densely populated countries in the world etymology the name of the country is derived from the namib desert considered to be the oldest desert in the world the name namib itself is of nama origin and means vast place before its independence in 1990 the area was known first as german south-west africa deutsch-sdwestafrika then as south-west africa reflecting the colonial occupation by the germans and the south africans technically on behalf of the british crown reflecting south africas dominion status within the british empire history pre-colonial period the dry lands of namibia have been inhabited since early times by san damara and nama around the 14th century immigrating bantu people began to arrive during the bantu expansion from central africa from the late 18th century onward oorlam people from cape colony crossed the orange river and moved into the area that today is southern namibia their encounters with the nomadic nama tribes were largely peaceful they received the missionaries accompanying the oorlam very well granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment on their way further northwards however the oorlam encountered clans of the herero at windhoek gobabis and okahandja who resisted their encroachment the nama-herero war broke out in 1880 with hostilities ebbing only after the german empire deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the nama oorlam and herero the first europeans to disembark and explore the region were the portuguese navigators diogo co in 1485 and bartolomeu dias in 1486 but the portuguese crown did not try to claim the area like most of interior sub-saharan africa namibia was not extensively explored by europeans until the 19th century at that time traders and settlers came principally from germany and sweden in the late 19th century dorsland trekkers crossed the area on their way from the transvaal to angola some of them settled in namibia instead of continuing their journey german rule namibia became a german colony in 1884 under otto von bismarck to forestall perceived british encroachment and was known as german south west africa deutsch-sdwestafrika however the palgrave commission by the british governor in cape town had determined that only the natural deep-water harbor of walvis bay was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the cape province of british south africa from 1904 to 1907 the herero and the namaqua took up arms against brutal german colonialism in calculated punitive action by the german occupiers government officials ordered extinction of the natives in the herero and namaqua genocide in what has been called the first genocide of the twentieth century the germans systematically killed 10000 nama half the population and approximately 65000 herero about 80 of the population the survivors when finally released from detention were subjected to a policy of dispossession deportation forced labor racial segregation and discrimination in a system that in many ways anticipated the apartheid established by south africa in 1948 most africans were confined to so-called native territories which later under south african rule after 1949 were turned into homelands bantustans indeed some historians have speculated that the german genocide in namibia was a model used by nazis in the holocaust the memory of genocide remains relevant to ethnic identity in independent namibia and to relations with germany the german government formally apologized for the namibian genocide in 2004 south african mandate during world war i south african troops under general louis botha occupied the territory and deposed the german colonial administration the end of the war and the treaty of versailles left south africa in possession of south west africa as a league of nations mandate the mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated for an allied annexation of former german and turkish territories and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves it permitted the south african government to administer south west africa for an undefined period until that territorys inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination however south africa interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare south west africa for future autonomy as a result of the conference on international organization in 1945 the league of nations was formally superseded by the united nations un and former league mandates by a trusteeship system article 77 of the united nations charter stated that un trusteeship shall applyto territories now held under mandate furthermore it would be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms the un requested all former league of nations mandates be surrendered to its trusteeship council in anticipation of their independence south africa declined to do so and instead requested permission from the un to formally annex south west africa for which it received considerable criticism when the un general assembly rejected this proposal south africa dismissed its opinion as irrelevant and began solidifying control of the territory the un responded by deferring to the international court of justice icj which held a number of discussions on the legality of south african rule between 1949 and 1966 south africa began imposing apartheid its codified system of racial segregation and discrimination on south west africa during the late 1940s black south west africans were subject to pass laws curfews and a host of draconian residential regulations that heavily restricted their movement development was concentrated in the region of the country immediately adjacent to south africa formally denoted as the police zone where most of the german colonial era settlements and mines were also located outside the police zone indigenous peoples were restricted to theoretically self-governing tribal homelands during the late 1950s and early 1960s pressure for global decolonisation and national self-determination began mounting on the african continent these factors had a radical impact on south west african nationalism early nationalist organisations such as the south west african national union swanu and south west african peoples organisation swapo made determined attempts to establish indigenous political structures for an independent south west africa in 1966 following the icjs controversial ruling that it had no legal standing to consider the question of south african rule swapo launched an armed insurgency which escalated into part of a wider regional conflict known as the south african border war independence as swapos insurgency intensified south africas case for annexation in the international community continued to decline the un declared that south africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of south west africa and had thus disavowed its own mandate on 12 june 1968 the un general assembly adopted a resolution which proclaimed that in accordance with the desires of its people south west africa be renamed namibia united nations security council resolution 269 adopted in august 1969 declared south africas continued occupation of namibia illegal in recognition of this landmark decision swapos armed wing was renamed the peoples liberation army of namibia plan namibia became one of several flashpoints for cold war proxy conflicts in southern africa during the latter years of the plan insurgency the insurgents sought out weapons and sent recruits to the soviet union for military training swapos political leadership dependent on military aid from the soviets cuba and angola positioned the movement within the socialist bloc by 1975 this practical alliance reinforced the prevailing perspective of swapo as a soviet proxy which dominated cold war ideology in south africa and the united states for its part the soviet union supported swapo partly because it viewed south africa as a regional western ally growing war weariness and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers compelled south africa angola and cuba to accede to the tripartite accord under pressure from both the soviet union and the united states south africa accepted namibian independence in exchange for a cuban military withdrawal from the region and an angolan commitment to cease all aid to plan plan and south africa adopted an informal ceasefire in august 1988 and a united nations transition assistance group untag was formed to monitor the namibian peace process and supervise the return of refugees the ceasefire was broken after plan made a final incursion into the territory possibly as a result of misunderstanding untags directives in march 1989 a new ceasefire was later imposed with the condition that the insurgents were to be confined to their external bases in angola until they could be disarmed and demobilised by untag by the end of the eleven month transition period the last south african troops had been withdrawn from namibia all political prisoners granted amnesty racially discriminatory legislation repealed and 42000 namibian refugees returned to their homes just over 97 of eligible voters participated in the countrys first parliamentary elections held under a universal franchise swapo won a plurality of seats in the constituent assembly with 57 of the popular vote this gave the party 41 seats but not a two-thirds majority which would have enabled it to draft the constitution on its own the namibian constitution adopted in february 1990 incorporated protection for human rights compensation for state expropriations of private property and established an independent judiciary legislature and an executive presidency the constituent assembly became the national assembly the country officially became independent on 21 march 1990 sam nujoma was sworn in as the first president of namibia at a ceremony attended by nelson mandela of south africa who had been released from prison the previous month and representatives from 147 countries including 20 heads of state upon the end of apartheid in south africa in 1994 the nation ceded walvis bay to namibia after independence since independence namibia has completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy multiparty democracy was introduced and has been maintained with local regional and national elections held regularly several registered political parties are active and represented in the national assembly although the swapo has won every election since independence the transition from the 15-year rule of president sam nujoma to his successor hifikepunye pohamba in 2005 went smoothly since independence the namibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation it issued an amnesty for those who had fought on either side during the liberation war the civil war in angola spilled over and adversely affected namibians living in the north of the country in 1998 namibia defence force ndf troops were sent to the democratic republic of the congo as part of a southern african development community sadc contingent in 1999 the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern caprivi strip the caprivi conflict was initiated by the caprivi liberation army cla a rebel group led by mishake muyongo it wanted the caprivi strip to secede in order to form its own society geography at 825615km 318772sqmi namibia is the worlds thirty-fourth largest country after venezuela it lies mostly between latitudes 17 and 29s a small area is north of 17 and longitudes 11 and 26e being situated between the namib and the kalahari deserts namibia has the least rainfall of any country in sub-saharan africa the namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas each with characteristic abiotic conditions and vegetation with some variation within and overlap between them the central plateau the namib the great escarpment the bushveld and the kalahari desert the central plateau runs from north to south bordered by the skeleton coast to the northwest the namib desert and its coastal plains to the southwest the orange river to the south and the kalahari desert to the east the central plateau is home to the highest point in namibia at knigstein elevation 2606 metres 8550ft the namib is a broad expanse of hyper-arid gravel plains and dunes that stretches along namibias entire coastline it varies between 100 and many hundreds of kilometres in width areas within the namib include the skeleton coast and the kaokoveld in the north and the extensive namib sand sea along the central coast the great escarpment swiftly rises to over 2000 metres 6562ft average temperatures and temperature ranges increase further inland from the cold atlantic waters while the lingering coastal fogs slowly diminish although the area is rocky with poorly developed soils it is significantly more productive than the namib desert as summer winds are forced over the escarpment moisture is extracted as precipitation the bushveld is found in north-eastern namibia along the angolan border and in the caprivi strip the area receives a significantly greater amount of precipitation than the rest of the country averaging around 400mm 157in per year the area is generally flat and the soils sandy limiting their ability to retain water and support agriculture the kalahari desert an arid region that extends into south africa and botswana is one of namibias well-known geographical features the kalahari while popularly known as a desert has a variety of localised environments including some verdant and technically non-desert areas the succulent karoo is home to over 5000 species of plants nearly half of them endemic approximately 10 percent of the worlds succulents are found in the karoo the reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation namibias coastal desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world its sand dunes created by the strong onshore winds are the highest in the world because of the location of the shoreline at the point where the atlantics cold water reaches africas hot climate often extremely dense fog forms along the coast near the coast there are areas where the dunes are vegetated with hammocks namibia has rich coastal and marine resources that remain largely unexplored climate namibia extends from 17s to 25s latitude climatically the range of the sub-tropical high pressure belt its overall climate description is arid descending from the sub-humid mean rain above 500mm 20in through semi-arid between 300 and 500mm 12 and 20in embracing most of the waterless kalahari and arid from 150 to 300mm 6 to 12in these three regions are inland from the western escarpment to the hyper-arid coastal plain less than 100mm 4in temperature maxima are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region only in the far south warmbad for instance are mid-40c 100f maxima recorded typically the sub-tropical high pressure belt with frequent clear skies provides more than 300 days of sunshine per year it is situated at the southern edge of the tropics the tropic of capricorn cuts the country about in half the winter june august is generally dry both rainy seasons occur in summer the small rainy season between september and november the big one between february and april humidity is low and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600mm 24in in the caprivi strip rainfall is highly variable and droughts are common the last rainy season with rainfall far below the annual average occurred in summer 200607 weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold north-flowing benguela current of the atlantic ocean which accounts for very low precipitation 50mm 2in per year or less frequent dense fog and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country in winter occasionally a condition known as bergwind german for mountain breeze or oosweer afrikaans for east weather occurs a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast as the area behind the coast is a desert these winds can develop into sand storms leaving sand deposits in the atlantic ocean that are visible on satellite images the central plateau and kalahari areas have wide diurnal temperature ranges of up to 30c 54f efundja the annual seasonal flooding of the northern parts of the country often causes not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life the rains that cause these floods originate in angola flow into namibias cuvelai basin and fill the oshanas oshiwambo flood plains there the worst floods so far occurred in march 2011 and displaced 21000 people water sources namibia is the driest country in sub-saharan africa and depends largely on groundwater with an average rainfall of about 350mm 14in per annum the highest rainfall occurs in the caprivi in the northeast about 600mm 24in per annum and decreases in a westerly and southwesterly direction to as little as 50mm 2in and less per annum at the coast the only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with south africa angola zambia and the short border with botswana in the caprivi in the interior of the country surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls otherwise surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams they are dependent on groundwater even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources such as mining agriculture and tourism can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80 of the country more than 100000 boreholes have been drilled in namibia over the past century one third of these boreholes have been drilled dry communal wildlife conservancies namibia is one of few countries in the world to specifically address conservation and protection of natural resources in its constitution article 95 states the state shall actively promote and maintain the welfare of the people by adopting international policies aimed at the following maintenance of ecosystems essential ecological processes and biological diversity of namibia and utilisation of living natural resources on a sustainable basis for the benefit of all namibians both present and future in 1993 the newly formed government of namibia received funding from the united states agency for international development usaid through its living in a finite environment life project the ministry of environment and tourism with the financial support from organisations such as usaid endangered wildlife trust wwf and canadian ambassadors fund together form a community based natural resource management cbnrm support structure the main goal of this project is promote sustainable natural resource management by giving local communities rights to wildlife management and tourism politics and government namibia is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic the president of namibia is elected to a five-year term and is both the head of state and the head of government however while the president is both head of state and government all members of the government are individually and collectively responsible to the legislature the constitution of namibia guarantees the separation of powers executive executive power is exercised by the president and the government legislature namibia has a bicameral parliament with the national assembly as lower house and the national council as the upper house judiciary namibia has a system of courts that interpret and apply the law in the name of the state while the constitution envisaged a multi-party system for namibias government the swapo party has been dominant since independence in 1990 foreign relations namibia follows a largely independent foreign policy with persisting affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle including cuba with a small army and a fragile economy the namibian governments principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the southern african region a dynamic member of the southern african development community namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration namibia became the 160th member of the un on 23 april 1990 on its independence it became the fiftieth member of the commonwealth of nations military namibia does not have any enemies in the region although it has been involved in various disputes regarding borders and construction plans it consistently spends more as a percentage of gdp on its military than all of its neighbours except angola military expenditure rose from 27 of gdp in 2000 to 37 in 2009 and the arrival of 12 chengdu j-7 airguard jets in 2006 and 2008 made namibia for a short time one of the top arms importers in sub-saharan africa by 2015 military expenditure was estimated at between 4 and 5 of gdp the constitution of namibia defined the role of the military as defending the territory and national interests namibia formed the namibian defence force ndf comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war the peoples liberation army of namibia plan and south west african territorial force swatf the british formulated the plan for integrating these forces and began training the ndf which consists of a small headquarters and five battalions the united nations transitional assistance group untags kenyan infantry battalion remained in namibia for three months after independence to help train the ndf and to stabilise the north according to the namibian defence ministry enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7500 the current minister of the namibian military is hon penda yandakolo administrative divisions namibia is divided into 14 regions and subdivided into 121 constituencies the administrative division of namibia is tabled by delimitation commissions and accepted or declined by the national assembly since state foundation four delimitation commissions have delivered their work the last one in 2013 under the chairmanship of judge alfred siboleka regional councillors are directly elected through secret ballots regional elections by the inhabitants of their constituencies local authorities in namibia can be in the form of municipalities either part 1 or part 2 municipalities town councils or villages economy namibias economy is tied closely to south africas due to their shared history the largest economic sectors are mining 104 of the gross domestic product in 2009 agriculture 50 manufacturing 135 and tourism namibia has a highly developed banking sector with modern infrastructure such as online banking and cellphone banking the bank of namibia bon is the central bank of namibia responsible for performing all other functions ordinarily performed by a central bank there are 5 bon authorised commercial banks in namibia bank windhoek first national bank nedbank standard bank and small and medium enterprises bank according to the namibia labour force survey report 2012 conducted by the namibia statistics agency the countrys unemployment rate is 274 strict unemployment people actively seeking a full-time job stood at 202 in 2000 219 in 2004 and spiraled to 294 in 2008 under a broader definition including people that have given up searching for employment unemployment rose to 367 in 2004 this estimate considers people in the informal economy as employed labour and social welfare minister immanuel ngatjizeko praised the 2008 study as by far superior in scope and quality to any that has been available previously but its methodology has also received criticism in 2004 a labour act was passed to protect people from job discrimination stemming from pregnancy and hivaids status in early 2010 the government tender board announced that henceforth 100 per cent of all unskilled and semi-skilled labour must be sourced without exception from within namibia in 2013 global business and financial news provider bloomberg named namibia the top emerging market economy in africa and the 13th best in the world only four african countries made the top 20 emerging markets list in the march 2013 issue of bloomberg markets magazine and namibia was rated ahead of morocco 19th south africa 15th and zambia 14th worldwide namibia also fared better than hungary brazil and mexico bloomberg markets magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criteria the data came from bloombergs own financial-market statistics imf forecasts and the world bank the countries were also rated on areas of particular interest to foreign investors the ease of doing business the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom in order to attract foreign investment the government has made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulations making the country one of the least bureaucratic places to do business in the region however facilitation payments are occasionally demanded by customs due to cumbersome and costly customs procedures namibia is also classified as an upper middle income country by the world bank and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business the cost of living in namibia is relatively high because most of the goods including cereals need to be imported its capital city windhoek is currently ranked as the 150th most expensive place in the world for expatriates to live taxation in namibia includes personal income tax which is applicable to total taxable income of an individual and all individuals are taxed at progressive marginal rates over a series of income brackets the value added tax vat is applicable to most of the commodities and services despite the remote nature of much of the country namibia has seaports airports highways and railways narrow-gauge the country seeks to become a regional transportation hub it has an important seaport and several landlocked neighbours the central plateau already serves as a transportation corridor from the more densely populated north to south africa the source of four-fifths of namibias imports income disparity according to recent statistics on the countrys income share held by the highest 10 namibia is a country with a substantive income disparity the data indicates that the current income share held by the highest 10 is approximately 518 this disparity that exists in the country illustrates the large gap between the rich and the poor an additional figure describes the poverty gap people living on us2 or less in the country are approximately 1772 of the population agriculture about half of the population depends on agriculture largely subsistence agriculture for its livelihood but namibia must still import some of its food although per capita gdp is five times the per capita gdp of africas poorest countries the majority of namibias people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy the inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival although arable land accounts for only 1 of namibia nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture about 4000 mostly white commercial farmers own almost half of namibias arable land the governments of germany and britain will finance namibias land reform process as namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black namibians agreement has been reached on the privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years with hopes that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment however reinvestment of environmentally derived capital has hobbled namibian per capita income one of the fastest growing areas of economic development in namibia is the growth of wildlife conservancies these conservancies are particularly important to the rural generally unemployed population an aquifer called ohangwena ii located on both sides of the angola-namibia border was discovered in 2012 this aquifer has been estimated to be capable of supplying the 800000 people in the north for 400 years at the current 2018 rate of consumption experts estimate that namibia has 7720km 1850cumi of underground water mining and electricity providing 25 of namibias revenue mining is the single most important contributor to the economy namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in africa and the worlds fourth largest producer of uranium there has been significant investment in uranium mining and namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015 rich alluvial diamond deposits make namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds while namibia is known predominantly for its gem diamond and uranium deposits a number of other minerals are extracted industrially such as lead tungsten gold tin fluorspar manganese marble copper and zinc there are offshore gas deposits in the atlantic ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future according to the diamond investigation a book about the global diamond market from 1978 de beers the largest diamond company bought most of the namibian diamonds and would continue to do so because whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive domestic supply voltage is 220 v ac electricity is generated mainly by thermal and hydroelectric power plants non-conventional methods of electricity generation also play some role encouraged by the rich uranium deposits the namibian government plans to erect its first nuclear power station by 2018 also uranium enrichment is envisaged to happen locally diamonds although much of the worlds diamond supply comes from what have been called african blood diamonds namibia has managed to develop a diamond mining industry largely free of the kinds of conflict extortion and murder that have surrounded that of many other african nations with diamond mines this has been attributed to political dynamics economic institutions grievances political geography and the effects of neighborhoods and is the result of a joint agreement between the government and de beers which has led to a taxable base strengthening state institutions tourism tourism is a major contributor 145 to namibias gdp creating tens of thousands of jobs 182 of all employment directly or indirectly and servicing over a million tourists per year the country is a prime destination in africa and is known for ecotourism which features namibias extensive wildlife there are many lodges and reserves to accommodate eco-tourists sport and trophy hunting is also a large and growing component of the namibian economy accounting for 14 of total tourism in the year 2000 or 196million us dollars with namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters in addition extreme sports such as sandboarding skydiving and 4x4ing have become popular and many cities have companies that provide tours the most visited places include the capital city of windhoek caprivi strip fish river canyon sossusvlei the skeleton coast park sesriem etosha pan and the coastal towns of swakopmund walvis bay and lderitz the capital city of windhoek plays a very important role in namibias tourism due to its central location and close proximity to hosea kutako international airport according to the namibia tourism exit survey which was produced by the millennium challenge corporation for the namibian directorate of tourism 56 of all tourists visiting namibia during the time period 2012 2013 visited windhoek many of namibias tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as namibia wildlife resorts air namibia and the namibia tourism board as well as namibias tourism related trade associations such as the hospitality association of namibia are also all headquartered in windhoek there are also a number of notable hotels in windhoek such as windhoek country club resort and some international hotel chains also operate in windhoek such as avani hotels and resorts and hilton hotels and resorts namibias primary tourism related governing body the namibia tourism board ntb was established by an act of parliament the namibia tourism board act 2000 act 21 of 2000 its primary objectives are to regulate the tourism industry and to market namibia as a tourist destination there are also a number of trade associations that represent the tourism sector in namibia such as the federation of namibia tourism associations the umbrella body for all tourism associations in namibia the hospitality association of namibia the association of namibian travel agents car rental association of namibia and the tour and safari association of namibia water supply and sanitation namibia is the only country in sub-saharan africa to provide water through municipal departments the only bulk water supplier in namibia is namwater which sells it to the respective municipalities which in turn deliver it through their reticulation networks in rural areas the directorate of rural water supply in the ministry of agriculture water and forestry is in charge of drinking water supply the un evaluated in 2011 that namibia has improved its water access network significantly since independence in 1990 a large part of the population can not however make use of these resources due to the prohibitively high consumption cost and the long distance between residences and water points in rural areas as a result many namibians prefer the traditional wells over the available water points far away compared to the efforts made to improve access to safe water namibia is lagging behind in the provision of adequate sanitation this includes 298 schools that have no toilet facilities over 50 of child deaths are related to lack of water sanitation or hygiene 23 are due to diarrhea alone the un has identified a sanitation crisis in the country apart from residences for upper and middle class households sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in townships due to their water consumption and installation cost as a result access to improved sanitation has not increased much since independence in namibias rural areas 13 of the population had more than basic sanitation up from 8 in 1990 many of namibias inhabitants have to resort to flying toilets plastic bags to defecate which after use are flung into the bush the use of open areas close to residential land to urinate and defecate is very common and has been identified as a major health hazard demographics namibia has the second-lowest population density of any sovereign country after mongolia the majority of the namibian population is of bantu-speaking origin mostly of the ovambo ethnicity which forms about half of the population residing mainly in the north of the country although many are now resident in towns throughout namibia other ethnic groups are the herero and himba people who speak a similar language and the damara who speak the same click language as the nama in addition to the bantu majority there are large groups of khoisan such as nama and san who are descendants of the original inhabitants of southern africa the country also contains some descendants of refugees from angola there are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins called coloureds and basters who together make up 80 with the coloureds outnumbering the basters two to one there is a substantial chinese minority in namibia it stood at 40000 in 2006 whites mainly of afrikaner german british and portuguese origin make up between 40 and 70 of the population although their percentage of population decreased after independence due to emigration and lower birth rates they still form the second-largest population of european ancestry both in terms of percentage and actual numbers in sub-saharan africa after south africa the majority of namibian whites and nearly all those who are mixed race speak afrikaans and share similar origins culture and religion as the white and coloured populations of south africa a large minority of whites around 30000 trace their family origins back

that the country should become officially monolingual choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour south africa which granted all 11 of its major languages official status which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation consequently swapo instituted english as the sole official language of namibia though only about 3 of the population speaks it as a home language its implementation is focused on the civil service education and the broadcasting system some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools it is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools and english language is a compulsory subject some critics however argue that as in other postcolonial african societies the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low
