erik thorvaldsson old norse eirkr orvaldsson 950 c 1003 known as erik the red old norse eirkr hinn raui was a norse explorer remembered in medieval and icelandic saga sources as having founded the first settlement in greenland according to icelandic sagas he was born in the jren district of rogaland norway as the son of orvald svaldsson he therefore also appears patronymically as erik thorvaldsson eirkr orvaldsson the appellation the red most likely refers to his hair color and the color of his beard leif erikson the famous icelandic explorer was eriks son exiles erik the reds father thorvald asvaldsson was banished from norway because of some killings he left with his son erik to northwest iceland where he died before 980 according to the grnlendinga saga there was a man called thorvald who was the father of eirik the red he and eirik left their home in jaederen in norway because of some killings and went to iceland which had been extensively settled by then when erik was about 10 years old he sailed west from norway with his family and settled in hornstrandir in northwestern iceland the icelanders later sentenced erik to exile for three years for killing eyiolf the foul around the year 982 after marrying thjodhild jhildr erik moved to haukadalr hawksdale where he built a farm called eirksstair the initial confrontation occurred when his thralls slaves started a landslide on the neighboring farm belonging to valthjof valjfr valthjofs friend eyiolf the foul eyjlfr saurr killed the thralls in retaliation erik killed eyjiolf and holmgang-hrafn hlmgngu-hrafn eyiolfs kinsmen demanded his banishment from haukadal erik then moved to the island of xney he asked thorgest rgestr to keep his setstokkr inherited ornamented beams of significant mystical value which his father had brought from norway when he had finished his new house he went back to get them but they could not be obtained erik then went to breidabolstad and took them these are likely to have been thorgests setstokkr although the sagas are unclear at this point thorgest gave chase and in the ensuing fight erik slew both thorgests sons and a few other men after this each of them retained a considerable body of men with him at his home styr gave erik his support as did also eyiolf of sviney thorbjiorn vifils son and the sons of thorbrand of alptafirth while thorgest was backed by the sons of thord the yeller and thorgeir of hitardal aslak of langadal and his son illugi the dispute was resolved at an assembly the thing with the result that erik was outlawed for three years discoveries even though popular history credits erik as the first person to discover greenland the icelandic sagas suggest that earlier norsemen discovered and tried to settle it before him tradition credits gunnbjrn ulfsson also known as gunnbjrn ulf-krakuson with the first sighting of the land-mass nearly a century before erik strong winds had driven gunnbjrn towards a land he called gunnbjarnarsker gunnbjrns skerries but the accidental nature of gunnbjrns discovery has led to his neglect in the history of greenland after gunnbjrn snbjrn galti had also visited greenland according to records from the time galti headed the first norse attempt to colonize greenland which ended in disaster erik the red was the first permanent european settler in this context about 982 erik sailed to a somewhat mysterious and little-known land he rounded the southern tip of the island later known as cape farewell and sailed up the western coast he eventually reached a part of the coast that for the most part seemed ice-free and consequently had conditionssimilar to those of icelandthat promised growth and future prosperity according to the saga of erik the red he spent his three years of exile exploring this land the first winter he spent on the island of eiriksey the second winter he passed in eiriksholmar close to hvarfsgnipa in the final summer he explored as far north as snaefell and into hrafnsfjord when erik returned to iceland after his exile had expired he is said to have brought with him stories of greenland erik deliberately gave the land a more appealing name than iceland in order to lure potential settlers he explained people would be attracted to go there if it had a favorable name he knew that the success of any settlement in greenland would need the support of as many people as possible his salesmanship proved successful as many people especially those vikings living on poor land in iceland and those that had suffered a recent famine became convinced that greenland held great opportunity after spending the winter in iceland erik returned to greenland in 985 with a large number of colonists out of 25 ships that left for greenland only 14 arrived 11 were lost at sea the icelanders established two colonies on the southwest coast the eastern settlement or eystribygg in modern-day qaqortoq and the western settlement or vestribygg close to present-day nuuk eventually a middle settlement grew but many people suggest it formed part of the western settlement the eastern and western settlements both established on the southwest coast proved the only two areas suitable for farming during the summers when the weather favored travel more each settlement would send an army of men to hunt in disko bay above the arctic circle for food and other valuable commodities such as seals used for rope ivory from walrus tusks and beached whales eystribygg in eystribygg or eastern settlement erik built the estate of brattahl near present-day narsarsuaq he held the title of paramount chieftain of greenland and became both greatly respected and wealthy the settlement flourished growing to 5000 inhabitants spread over a considerable area along eriksfjord and neighboring fjords groups of immigrants escaping overcrowding in iceland joined the original party however one group of immigrants which arrived in 1002 brought with it an epidemic that ravaged the colony killing many of its leading citizens including erik himself nevertheless the colony rebounded and survived until the little ice age made the land marginal for european life-styles in the 15th century shortly before christopher columbuss first voyage to the americas in 1492 pirate raids conflict with inuit moving into the norse territories and the colonys abandonment by norway became other factors in its decline relations medieval icelandic tradition relates that erik the red and his wife jhildr thjodhildr had four children a daughter freyds and three sons the explorer leif eirksson orvaldr thorvald and orsteinn thorstein erik himself remained a follower of norse paganism unlike his son leif and leifs wife who became christians after being baptized by king olaf tryggvason leif brought the message of christianity to greenland becoming something of an evangelist while his wife took heartily to the religion even commissioning greenlands first church erik greatly disliked the faith and stuck to his norse gods which the sagas relate led thjodhild to withhold intercourse from her husband thjothhild was the daughter of jrundur ulfsson and thorbjrg gilsdottir from whom gilsfjrd is named jrunds mother bjrg was granddaughter to irish king cerball mac dnlainge kjarval through his daughter rafarta while not the first to sight the north american continent leif erikson became the first viking to explore the land of vinland part of north america probably near modern-day newfoundland leif invited his father on the voyage but according to legend erik fell off his horse on his way to the ship and took this as a bad sign leaving his son to continue without his company erik died the winter after his sons departure there is no evidence that leif was aware of his fathers death until he returned to greenland comparisons to grnlendinga saga there are numerous parallels to the grnlendinga saga including recurring characters and recounts of the same expeditions although with a few notable differences the saga of erik the red presents a number of the expeditions in the grnlendinga saga as just one expedition led by thorfinnr karlsefni although thorvaldr eirksson freyds eirkssdttir and karlsefnis wife gurr play key roles in the retelling another notable difference is the location of their settlements in the grnlendinga saga karlsefni and the others settle in a place that is only referred to as vinland while in erik the reds saga they form two base settlements straumfjrr where they spend winter and the following spring and hop where they later settle and run into problems with the natives as depicted in the grnlendinga saga otherwise the tales are largely similar both with heavy focuses on the exploits of
