pluto minor planet designation 134340 pluto is a dwarf planet in the kuiper belt a ring of bodies beyond neptune it was the first kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known plutoid or ice dwarf pluto was discovered by clyde tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the sun after 1992 its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the kuiper belt in 2005 eris a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27 more massive than pluto was discovered this led the international astronomical union iau to define the term planet formally in 2006 during their 26th general assembly that definition excluded pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet pluto is the largest and second-most-massive after eris known dwarf planet in the solar system and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the sun it is the largest known trans-neptunian object by volume but is less massive than eris like other kuiper belt objects pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively smallabout one-sixth the mass of the moon and one-third its volume it has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49astronomical units or au 4474 billionkm from the sun this means that pluto periodically comes closer to the sun than neptune but a stable orbital resonance with neptune prevents them from colliding light from the sun takes about 55 hours to reach pluto at its average distance 395au pluto has five known moons charon the largest with a diameter just over half that of pluto styx nix kerberos and hydra pluto and charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body on july 14 2015 the new horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by pluto during its brief flyby new horizons made detailed measurements and observations of pluto and its moons in september 2016 astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of charon is composed of tholins organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life and produced from methane nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of pluto and transferred about 19000km 12000mi to the orbiting moon history discovery in the 1840s urbain le verrier used newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of uranus subsequent observations of neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that uranuss orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides neptune in 1906 percival lowella wealthy bostonian who had founded lowell observatory in flagstaff arizona in 1894started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet which he termed planet x by 1909 lowell and william h pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916 but to no avail unknown to lowell his surveys had captured two faint images of pluto on march 19 and april 7 1915 but they were not recognized for what they were there are fourteen other known precovery observations with the earliest made by the yerkes observatory on august 20 1909 percivals widow constance lowell entered into a ten-year legal battle with the lowell observatory over her husbands legacy and the search for planet x did not resume until 1929 vesto melvin slipher the observatory director gave the job of locating planet x to 23-year-old clyde tombaugh who had just arrived at the observatory after slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings tombaughs task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position using a blink comparator he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs on february 18 1930 after nearly a year of searching tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on january 23 and 29 a lesser-quality photograph taken on january 21 helped confirm the movement after the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs news of the discovery was telegraphed to the harvard college observatory on march 13 1930 pluto has yet to complete a full orbit of the sun since its discovery because one plutonian year is 24768 years long name the discovery made headlines around the globe lowell observatory which had the right to name the new object received more than 1000 suggestions from all over the world ranging from atlas to zymal tombaugh urged slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did constance lowell proposed zeus then percival and finally constance these suggestions were disregarded the name pluto after the god of the underworld was proposed by venetia burney 19182009 an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in oxford england who was interested in classical mythology she suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather falconer madan a former librarian at the university of oxfords bodleian library who passed the name to astronomy professor herbert hall turner who cabled it to colleagues in the united states each member of the lowell observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three potential names minerva which was already the name for an asteroid cronus which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer thomas jefferson jackson see and pluto pluto received every vote the name was announced on may 1 1930 upon the announcement madan gave venetia 5 equivalent to 300 gbp or 450 usd in 2014 as a reward the final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of pluto are the initials of percival lowell plutos astronomical symbol unicode u2647 was then created as a monogram constructed from the letters pl plutos astrological symbol resembles that of neptune but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident the name was soon embraced by wider culture in 1930 walt disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for mickey mouse a canine companion named pluto although disney animator ben sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given in 1941 glenn t seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after pluto in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets following uranium which was named after uranus and neptunium which was named after neptune most languages use the name pluto in various transliterations in japanese houei nojiri suggested the translation meisei star of the king god of the underworld and this was borrowed into chinese korean and vietnamese which instead uses sao dim vng which was derived from the chinese term ynwng as minh is a homophone for the sino-vietnamese words for dark and bright some indian languages use the name pluto but others such as hindi use the name of yama the god of death in hindu and buddhist mythology polynesian languages also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld as in mori whiro planet x disproved once pluto was found its faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was lowells planet x estimates of plutos mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on neptune and uranus in 1931 pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of earth with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of mars in 1976 dale cruikshank carl pilcher and david morrison of the university of hawaii calculated plutos albedo for the first time finding that it matched that for methane ice this meant pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of earth plutos albedo is 1419 times that of earth in 1978 the discovery of plutos moon charon allowed the measurement of plutos mass for the first time roughly 02 that of earth and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of uranus subsequent searches for an alternative planet x notably by robert sutton harrington failed in 1992 myles standish used data from voyager 2s flyby of neptune in 1989 which had revised the estimates of neptunes mass downward by 05an amount comparable to the mass of marsto recalculate its gravitational effect on uranus with the new figures added in the discrepancies and with them the need for a planet x vanished today the majority of scientists agree that planet x as lowell defined it does not exist lowell had made a prediction of planet xs orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to plutos actual orbit and its position at that time ernest w brown concluded soon after plutos discovery that this was a coincidence a view still held today classification v t e from 1992 onward many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as pluto showing that pluto is part of a population of objects called the kuiper belt this made its official status as a planet controversial with many questioning whether pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting pluto from planetary models of the solar system the hayden planetarium reopenedin february 2000 after renovationwith a model of only eight planets which made headlines almost a year later as objects increasingly closer in size to pluto were discovered in the region it was argued that pluto should be reclassified as one of the kuiper belt objects just as ceres pallas juno and vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids on july 29 2005 astronomers at caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-neptunian object eris which was substantially more massive than pluto and the most massive object discovered in the solar system since triton in 1846 its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying pluto as a minor planet iau classification the debate came to a head in august 2006 with an iau resolution that created an official definition for the term planet according to this resolution there are three conditions for an object in the solar system to be considered a planet the object must be in orbit around the sun the object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity more specifically its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by hydrostatic equilibrium it must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit pluto fails to meet the third condition its mass is substantially less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit 007 times in contrast to earth which is 17 million times the remaining mass in its orbit excluding the moon the iau further decided that bodies that like pluto meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3 would be called dwarf planets in september 2006 the iau included pluto and eris and its moon dysnomia in their minor planet catalogue giving them the official minor planet designations 134340 pluto 136199 eris and 136199 eris i dysnomia had pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930 it would have likely been designated 1164 following 1163 saga which was discovered a month earlier there has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification alan stern principal investigator with nasas new horizons mission to pluto derided the iau resolution stating that the definition stinks for technical reasons stern contended that by the terms of the new definition earth mars jupiter and neptune all of which share their orbits with asteroids would be excluded he argued that all big spherical moons including the moon should likewise be considered planets he also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community marc w buie then at the lowell observatory petitioned against the definition others have supported the iau mike brown the astronomer who discovered eris said through this whole crazy circus-like procedure somehow the right answer was stumbled on its been a long time coming science is self-correcting eventually even when strong emotions are involved public reception to the iau decision was mixed many accepted the reclassification but some sought to overturn the decision with online petitions urging the iau to consider reinstatement a resolution introduced by some members of the california state assembly facetiously called the iau decision a scientific heresy the new mexico house of representatives passed a resolution in honor of tombaugh a longtime resident of that state that declared that pluto will always be considered a planet while in new mexican skies and that march 13 2007 was pluto planet day the illinois senate passed a similar resolution in 2009 on the basis that clyde tombaugh the discoverer of pluto was born in illinois the resolution asserted that pluto was unfairly downgraded to a dwarf planet by the iau some members of the public have also rejected the change citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue or for sentimental reasons maintaining that they have always known pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the iau decision in 2006 in its 17th annual words-of-the-year vote the american dialect society voted plutoed as the word of the year to pluto is to demote or devalue someone or something researchers on both sides of the debate gathered in august 2008 at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory for a conference that included back-to-back talks on the current iau definition of a planet entitled the great planet debate the conference published a post-conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about the definition of planet in june 2008 the iau had announced in a press release that the term plutoid would henceforth be used to refer to pluto and other objects that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of neptune and enough mass to be of near-spherical shape orbit plutos orbital period is currently about 248 years its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets which follow nearly circular orbits around the sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic in contrast plutos orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic over 17 and moderately eccentric elliptical this eccentricity means a small region of plutos orbit lies closer to the sun than neptunes the plutocharon barycenter came to perihelion on september 5 1989 and was last closer to the sun than neptune between february 7 1979 and february 11 1999 in the long term plutos orbit is chaotic computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years both forward and backward in time but after intervals longer than the lyapunov time of 1020 million years calculations become speculative pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the solar system hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change plutos position in its orbit the semi-major axis of plutos orbit varies between about 393 and 396au with a period of about 19951 years corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years the semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer relationship with neptune despite plutos orbit appearing to cross that of neptune when viewed from directly above the two objects orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely the two orbits do not intersect when pluto is closest to the sun and hence closest to neptunes orbit as viewed from above it is also the farthest above neptunes path plutos orbit passes about 8 au above that of neptune preventing a collision this alone is not enough to protect pluto perturbations from the planets especially neptune could alter plutos orbit such as its orbital precession over millions of years so that a collision could be possible however pluto is also protected by its 23 orbital resonance with neptune for every two orbits that pluto makes around the sun neptune makes three each cycle lasts about 495 years this pattern is such that in each 495-year cycle the first time pluto is near perihelion neptune is over 50 behind pluto by plutos second perihelion neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits and so will be nearly 130 ahead of pluto pluto and neptunes minimum separation is over 17au which is greater than plutos minimum separation from uranus 11au the minimum separation between pluto and neptune actually occurs near the time of plutos aphelion the 23 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years this prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another and so the two bodies can never pass near each other even if plutos orbit were not inclined the two bodies could never collide the long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection if plutos period is slightly shorter than 32 of neptune its orbit relative to neptune will drift causing it to make closer approaches behind neptunes orbit the strong gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum to be transferred to pluto at neptunes expense this moves pluto into a slightly larger orbit where it travels slightly more slowly according to keplers third law after many such repetitions pluto is sufficiently slowed and neptune sufficiently sped up that pluto orbit relative to neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed the whole process takes about 20000 years to complete other factors numerical studies have shown that over millions of years the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of pluto and neptune does not change there are several other resonances and interactions that enhance plutos stability these arise principally from two additional mechanisms besides the 23 mean-motion resonance first plutos argument of perihelion the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the sun librates around 90 this means that when pluto is closest to the sun it is at its farthest above the plane of the solar system preventing encounters with neptune this is a consequence of the kozai mechanism which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing bodyin this case neptune relative to neptune the amplitude of libration is 38 and so the angular separation of plutos perihelion to the orbit of neptune is always greater than 52 9038 the closest such angular separation occurs every 10000 years second the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodiesthe points where they cross the eclipticare in near-resonance with the above libration when the two longitudes are the samethat is when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the sunplutos perihelion lies exactly at 90 and hence it comes closest to the sun when it is highest above neptunes orbit this is known as the 11 superresonance all the jovian planets particularly jupiter play a role in the creation of the superresonance quasi-satellite in 2012 it was hypothesized that 15810 arawn could be a quasi-satellite of pluto a specific type of co-orbital configuration according to the hypothesis the object would be a quasi-satellite of pluto for about 350000 years out of every two-million-year period measurements made by the new horizons spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of arawn more accurately these calculations confirm the overall dynamics described in the hypothesis however it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of pluto based on this motion since its orbit is primarily controlled by neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by pluto rotation plutos rotation period its day is equal to 639 earth days like uranus pluto rotates on its side in its orbital plane with an axial tilt of 120 and so its seasonal variation is extreme at its solstices one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness the reason for this unusual orientation has been debated research from the university of arizona has suggested that it may be due to the way that a bodys spin will always adjust to minimise energy this could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles this is called polar wander according to a paper released from the university of arizona this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet these masses would cause the body to reorient itself leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120 the buildup of nitrogen is due to plutos vast distance from the sun at the equator temperatures can drop to 240c 4000f 331k causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on earth the same effect seen on pluto would be observed on earth if the antarctic ice sheet was several times larger geology surface the plains on plutos surface are composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice with traces of methane and carbon monoxide nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-charon face of pluto around 180 longitude where tombaugh regios western lobe sputnik planitia is located whereas methane is most abundant near 300 east the mountains are made of water ice plutos surface is quite varied with large differences in both brightness and color pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the solar system with as much contrast as saturns moon iapetus the color varies from charcoal black to dark orange and white plutos color is more similar to that of io with slightly more orange and significantly less red than mars notable geographical features include tombaugh regio or the heart a large bright area on the side opposite charon cthulhu macula or the whale a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere and the brass knuckles a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere sputnik planitia the western lobe of the heart is a 1000km-wide basin of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices divided into polygonal cells which are interpreted as convection cells that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and sublimation pits towards their margins there are obvious signs of glacial flows both into and out of the basin it has no craters that were visible to new horizons indicating that its surface is less than 10 million years old latest studies have shown that the surface has an age of 700518000000000000018000090000 40000 years the new horizons science team summarized initial findings as pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms including those resulting from glaciological and surfaceatmosphere interactions as well as impact tectonic possible cryovolcanic and mass-wasting processes in western parts of sputnik planitia there are fields of transverse dunes formed by the winds blowing from the center of sputnik planitia in the direction of surrounding mountains the dune wavelengths are in the range of 041km and they are likely consists of methane particles 200300m in size internal structure 1 frozen nitrogen 2 water ice 3 rock plutos density is 700318600000000000018600013gcm because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them scientists expect that plutos internal structure is differentiated with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of water ice the diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately 70061700000000000001700km 70 of plutos diameter it is possible that such heating continues today creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water 100 to 180 km thick at the coremantle boundary in september 2016 scientists at brown university simulated the impact thought to have formed sputnik planitia and showed that it might have been the result of liquid water upwelling from below after the collision implying the existence of a subsurface ocean at least 100km deep pluto has no magnetic field mass and size plutos diameter is 70062376600000000002376632km and its mass is 70221302999999999991303000310kg 177 that of the moon 022 that of earth its surface area is 7013177900000000000177910km or roughly the same surface area as russia its surface gravity is 0063 g compared to 1 g for earth the discovery of plutos satellite charon in 1978 enabled a determination of the mass of the plutocharon system by application of newtons formulation of keplers third law observations of pluto in occultation with charon allowed scientists to establish plutos diameter more accurately whereas the invention of adaptive optics allowed them to determine its shape more accurately with less than 02 lunar masses pluto is much less massive than the terrestrial planets and also less massive than seven moons ganymede titan callisto io the moon europa and triton the mass is much less than thought before charon was discovered pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the mass of the dwarf planet ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt it is less massive than the dwarf planet eris a trans-neptunian object discovered in 2005 though pluto has a larger diameter of 23766km compared to eriss approximate diameter of 2326km determinations of plutos size had been complicated by its atmosphere and hydrocarbon haze in march 2014 lellouch de bergh et al published findings regarding methane mixing ratios in plutos atmosphere consistent with a plutonian diameter greater than 2360km with a best guess of 2368km on july 13 2015 images from nasas new horizons mission long range reconnaissance imager lorri along with data from the other instruments determined plutos diameter to be 2370km 1470mi which was later revised to be 2372km 1474mi on july 24 and later to 700623740000000000023748km using radio occultation data from the new horizons radio science experiment rex the diameter was found to be 70062376600000000002376632km atmosphere pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen n2 methane ch4 and carbon monoxide co which are in equilibrium with their ices on plutos surface according to the measurements by new horizons the surface pressure is about 1pa 10bar roughly one million to 100000 times less than earths atmospheric pressure it was initially thought that as pluto moves away from the sun its atmosphere should gradually freeze onto the surface studies of new horizons data and ground-based occultations show that plutos atmospheric density increases and that it likely remains gaseous throughout plutos orbit new horizons observations showed that atmospheric escape of nitrogen to be 10000 times less than expected alan stern has contended that even a small increase in plutos surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in plutos atmospheric density from 18hpa to as much as 280hpa three times that of mars to a quarter that of the earth at such densities nitrogen could flow across the surface as liquid just like sweat cools the body as it evaporates from the skin the sublimation of plutos atmosphere cools its surface the presence of atmospheric gases was traced up to 1670 kilometers high the atmosphere does not have a sharp upper boundary the presence of methane a powerful greenhouse gas in plutos atmosphere creates a temperature inversion with the average temperature of its atmosphere tens of degrees warmer than its surface though observations by new horizons have revealed plutos upper atmosphere to be far colder than expected 70k as opposed to about 100k plutos atmosphere is divided into roughly 20 regularly spaced haze layers up to 150km high thought to be the result of pressure waves created by airflow across plutos mountains satellites pluto has five known natural satellites the closest to pluto is charon first identified in 1978 by astronomer james christy charon is the only moon of pluto in hydrostatic equilibrium charons mass is sufficient to cause the barycenter of the plutocharon system to be outside pluto beyond charon there are four much smaller circumbinary moons in order of distance from pluto they are styx nix kerberos and hydra nix and hydra were both discovered in 2005 kerberos was discovered in 2011 and styx was discovered in 2012 the satellites orbits are circular eccentricity 0006 and coplanar with plutos equator inclination 1 and therefore tilted approximately 120 relative to plutos orbit the plutonian system is highly compact the five known satellites orbit within the inner 3 of the region where prograde orbits would be stable the orbital periods of all plutos moons are linked in a system of orbital resonances and near resonances when precession is accounted for the orbital periods of styx nix and hydra are in an exact 182233 ratio there is a sequence of approximate ratios 3456 between the periods of styx nix kerberos and hydra with that of charon the ratios become closer to being exact the further out the moons are the plutocharon system is one of the few in the solar system whose barycenter lies outside the primary body the patroclusmenoetius system is a smaller example and the sunjupiter system is the only larger one the similarity in size of charon and pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a double dwarf planet the system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to the other which means that pluto and charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other from any position on either body the other is always at the same position in the sky or always obscured this also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter in 2007 observations by the gemini observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of charon suggested the presence of active cryo-geysers plutos moons are hypothesized to have been formed by a collision between pluto and a similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system the collision released material that consolidated into the moons around pluto origin plutos origin and identity had long puzzled astronomers one early hypothesis was that pluto was an escaped moon of neptune knocked out of orbit by its largest current moon triton this idea was eventually rejected after dynamical studies showed it to be impossible because pluto never approaches neptune in its orbit plutos true place in the solar system began to reveal itself only in 1992 when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond neptune that were similar to pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition this trans-neptunian population is thought to be the source of many short-period comets pluto is now known to be the largest member of the kuiper belt a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 au from the sun as of 2011 surveys of the kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining pluto-sized objects are expected to be beyond 100au from the sun like other kuiper-belt objects kbos pluto shares features with comets for example the solar wind is gradually blowing plutos surface into space it has been claimed that if pluto were placed as near to the sun as earth it would develop a tail as comets do this claim has been disputed with the argument that plutos escape velocity is too high for this to happen nonetheless it has also been claimed that pluto may have formed as a result of the agglomeration of numerous comets and related kuiper belt objects though pluto is the largest kuiper belt object discovered neptunes moon triton which is slightly larger than pluto is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically and is thought to be a captured kuiper belt object eris see above is about the same size as pluto though more massive but is not strictly considered a member of the kuiper belt population rather it is considered a member of a linked population called the scattered disc a large number of kuiper belt objects like pluto are in a 23 orbital resonance with neptune kbos with this orbital resonance are called plutinos after pluto like other members of the kuiper belt pluto is thought to be a residual planetesimal a component of the original protoplanetary disc around the sun that failed to fully coalesce into a full-fledged planet most astronomers agree that pluto owes its current position to a sudden migration undergone by neptune early in the solar systems formation as neptune migrated outward it approached the objects in the proto-kuiper belt setting one in orbit around itself triton locking others into resonances and knocking others into chaotic orbits the objects in the scattered disc a dynamically unstable region overlapping the kuiper belt are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with neptunes migrating resonances a computer model created in 2004 by alessandro morbidelli of the observatoire de la cte dazur in nice suggested that the migration of neptune into the kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 12 resonance between jupiter and saturn which created a gravitational push that propelled both uranus and neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places ultimately doubling neptunes distance from the sun the resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-kuiper belt could also explain the late heavy bombardment 600million years after the solar systems formation and the origin of the jupiter trojans it is possible that pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 au from the sun before neptunes migration perturbed it into a resonant capture the nice model requires that there were about a thousand pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk which included triton and eris observation and exploration plutos distance from earth makes its in-depth study and exploration difficult on july 14 2015 nasas new horizons space probe flew through the pluto system providing much information about it observation plutos visual apparent magnitude averages 151 brightening to 1365 at perihelion to see it a telescope is required around 30cm 12in aperture being desirable it looks star-like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes because its angular diameter is only 011 the earliest maps of pluto made in the late 1980s were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon charon observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the plutocharon system during the eclipses for example eclipsing a bright spot on pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map this method can also track changes in brightness over time better maps were produced from images taken by the hubble space telescope hst which offered higher resolution and showed considerably more detail resolving variations several hundred kilometers across including polar regions and large bright spots these maps were produced by complex computer processing which finds the best-fit projected maps for the few pixels of the hubble images these remained the most detailed maps of pluto until the flyby of new horizons in july 2015 because the two cameras on the hst used for these maps were no longer in service exploration the new horizons spacecraft which flew by pluto in july 2015 is the first and so far only attempt to explore pluto directly launched in 2006 it captured its first distant images of pluto in late september 2006 during a test of the long range reconnaissance imager the images taken from a distance of approximately 42 billion kilometers confirmed the spacecrafts ability to track distant targets critical for maneuvering toward pluto and other kuiper belt objects in early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from jupiter new horizons made its closest approach to pluto on july 14 2015 after a 3462-day journey across the solar system scientific observations of pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter observations were conducted using a remote sensing package that included imaging instruments and a radio science investigation tool as well as spectroscopic and other experiments the scientific goals of new horizons were to characterize the global geology and morphology of pluto and its moon charon map their surface composition and analyze plutos neutral atmosphere and its escape rate on october 25 2016 at 0548 pm et the last bit of data of a total of 50 billion bits of data or 625 gigabytes was received from new horizons from its close encounter with pluto since the new horizons flyby scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to pluto to fulfill new science objectives they include mapping the surface at 30 feet per pixel observations of plutos smaller satellites observations of how pluto changes as it rotates on its axis and topographic mapping of plutos regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt the last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of pluto new horizons principal investigator alan stern has advocated for a cassini-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 the 100th anniversary of plutos discovery and use charons gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the pluto system the orbiter could then use charons gravity to leave the pluto system and study more kbos after all pluto science objectives are completed a conceptual study funded by the nasa innovative advanced concepts niac program describes a fusion-enabled pluto orbiter and lander based on the princeton field-reversed configuration
