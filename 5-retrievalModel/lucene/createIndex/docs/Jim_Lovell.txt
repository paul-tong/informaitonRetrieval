the navy was beginning to make cutbacks in the program and cadets were under a great deal of pressure to transfer out there were concerns that some or most of the students who graduated as naval

course at what was then the naval air test center now the us naval test pilot school at naval air station patuxent river maryland two of his classmates were charles peter conrad and wally schirra lovell graduated first in his class later that year lovell conrad and schirra became three of 110 military test pilots selected as potential astronaut candidates for project mercury schirra went on to become one of the mercury seven with lovell and conrad failing to make the cut for medical reasons lovell because of a temporarily high bilirubin count in his blood and conrad for refusing to take the second round of invasive medical tests at nas patuxent river lovell was assigned to electronics test later weapons test with his assigned call sign being shaky a nickname given him by conrad he became f4h program manager during which time john young served under him in 1961 he received orders for vf-101 detachment alpha as an f4h instructor for the first east coast squadron personnel assigned to that aircraft nasa career in 1962 nasa needed a second group of astronauts for the gemini and apollo programs lovell applied a second time and was accepted into nasa astronaut group 2 the new nine as was conrad gemini program lovell was selected as backup pilot for gemini 4 this put him in position for his first space flight three missions later as pilot of gemini 7 with command pilot frank borman in december 1965 the flights objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit this fourteen-day flight set an endurance record making 206 orbits it was also the target vehicle for the first space rendezvous with gemini 6a lovell was later scheduled to be the backup command pilot of gemini 10 but after the deaths of the gemini 9 prime crew elliot see and charles bassett he replaced thomas p stafford as backup commander of gemini 9a this again positioned lovell for his second flight and first command of gemini 12 in november 1966 with pilot buzz aldrin this flight had three extravehicular activities made 59 orbits and achieved the fifth space rendezvous and fourth space docking with an agena target vehicle this mission was successful because it proved that humans can work effectively outside the spacecraft paved the way for the apollo missions and helped reach the goal of getting man on the moon by the end of the decade apollo program apollo 8 lovell was originally chosen as command module pilot cmp on the backup crew for apollo 9 along with neil armstrong as commander and buzz aldrin as lunar module pilot lmp apollo 9 was planned as a high-apogee earth orbital test of the lunar module lm lovell later replaced michael collins as cmp on the apollo 9 prime crew when collins needed to have surgery for a bone spur on his spine this reunited lovell with his gemini 7 commander frank borman and lm pilot william anders construction delays of the first manned lm prevented it from being ready in time to fly on apollo 8 planned as a low earth orbit test it was decided to swap the apollo 8 and apollo 9 prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as apollo 9 when the lm would be ready a lunar orbital flight now apollo 8 replaced the original apollo 9 medium earth orbit test borman lovell and anders were launched on december 21 1968 becoming the first men to travel to the moon as cm pilot lovell served as the navigator using the spacecrafts built-in sextant to determine its position by measuring star positions this information was then used to calculate required mid-course corrections the craft entered lunar orbit on christmas eve and made a total of ten orbits most of them circular at an altitude of approximately 70 miles 110km for a total of twenty hours they broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to earth lovell took his turn with borman and anders in reading a passage from the biblical creation story in the book of genesis they began their return to earth on christmas day with a rocket burn made on the moons far side out of radio contact with earth for this reason the lunar orbit insertion and trans-earth injection burns were the two most tense moments of this first lunar mission when contact was re-established lovell was the first to announce the good news please be informed there is a santa claus the crew splashed down safely on earth on december 27 apollo 13 lovell was backup commander of apollo 11 and was scheduled to command apollo 14 instead he and his crew swapped missions with the crew of apollo 13 as it was felt the commander of the other crew alan shepard needed more time to train after having been grounded for a long period by an ear problem lovell lifted off aboard apollo 13 on april 11 1970 with cm pilot jack swigert and lm pilot fred haise he and haise were to land on the moon during a routine cryogenic oxygen tank stir in transit to the moon a fire started inside an oxygen tank the most probable cause determined by nasa was damaged electrical insulation on wiring that created a spark that started the fire liquid oxygen rapidly turned into a high-pressure gas which burst the tank and caused the leak of a second oxygen tank in just over two hours all on-board oxygen was lost disabling the hydrogen fuel cells that provided electrical power to the commandservice module odyssey this required an immediate abort of the moon landing mission the sole objective now was to safely return the crew to earth apollo 13 was the second mission not to use a free return trajectory so that they could explore the western lunar regions using the lm as a life boat providing battery power oxygen and propulsion lovell and his crew re-established the free return trajectory that they had left and swung around the moon to return home based on the flight controllers calculations made on earth lovell had to adjust the course twice by manually controlling the lunar modules thrusters and engine apollo 13 returned safely to earth on april 17 lovell is one of only three men to travel to the moon twice but unlike john young and eugene cernan he never walked on it he accrued over 715 hours and had seen a total of 269 sunrises from space on his gemini and apollo flights this was a personal record that stood until the skylab 3 mission in july through september 1973 apollo 13s flight trajectory gives lovell haise and swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from earth later career lovell retired from the navy and the space program in 1973 and went to work at the bay-houston towing company in houston texas becoming ceo in 1975 he became president of fisk telephone systems in 1977 and later worked for centel retiring as

apollo 13 it was the basis for the ron howard movie apollo 13 lovells first impression on being approached about the film was that kevin costner would be a good choice to portray him given the physical resemblance but tom hanks was cast in the role in order to prepare hanks visited lovell and his wife at their home in texas and even flew with lovell in his private airplane in the film lovell has a cameo as the captain of the uss iwo jima the naval vessel that led the operation to recover the apollo 13 astronauts after their successful splashdown lovell can be seen as the naval officer shaking hanks hand as hanks speaks in voice-over in the scene where the astronauts come aboard the iwo jima filmmakers initially offered to make lovells character an admiral aboard the ship presumably rear admiral donald c davis commander task force 130 ctf 130 who was the senior officer aboard and welcomed them home however lovell said i retired as a captain and a captain i will be he
