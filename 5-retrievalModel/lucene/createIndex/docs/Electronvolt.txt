in physics the electronvolt symbol ev also written electron-volt and electron volt is a unit of energy equal to approximately 69811600000000000001610 joules symbol j in si units historically the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy e qv after passing through the potential v if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts one gets an energy in ev like the elementary charge on which it is based it is not an independent quantity but is equal to 1 jc2h0c0 it is a common unit of energy within physics widely used in solid state atomic nuclear and particle physics it is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli- kilo- mega- giga- tera- peta- or exa- mev kev mev gev tev pev and eev respectively in some older documents and in the name bevatron the symbol bev is used which stands for billion 10 electronvolts it is equivalent to the gev definition an electronvolt is the amount of energy gained or lost by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt hence it has a value of one volt 70001000000000000001jc multiplied by the electrons elementary charge e 6981160217662079999160217662089810c therefore one electronvolt is equal to 6981160217662079999160217662089810j the electronvolt is not an si unit and its definition is empirical unlike the litre the light-year and other such non-si units where its value in si units must be obtained experimentally mass by massenergy equivalence the electronvolt is also a unit of mass it is common in particle physics where units of mass and energy are often interchanged to express mass in units of evc where c is the speed of light in vacuum from e mc it is common to simply express mass in terms of ev as a unit of mass effectively using a system of natural units with c set to 1 the mass equivalent of 70001000000000000001evc is for example an electron and a positron each with a mass of 69995110000000000000511mevc can annihilate to yield 69871637424369714001022mev of energy the proton has a mass of 69999380000000000000938gevc in general the masses of all hadrons are of the order of 70001000000000000001gevc which makes the gev gigaelectronvolt a convenient unit of mass for particle physics the unified atomic mass unit u 1gram divided by avogadros number is almost the mass of a hydrogen atom which is mostly the mass of the proton to convert to megaelectronvolts use the formula momentum in high-energy physics the electronvolt is often used as a unit of momentum a potential difference of 1volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy ie 69811602176487000001ev this gives rise to usage of ev and kev mev gev or tev as units of momentum for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle the dimensions of momentum units are lmt the dimensions of energy units are lmt then dividing the units of energy such as ev by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity lt facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum in the field of high-energy particle physics the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c by dividing energy in ev by the speed of light one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of evc the fundamental velocity constant c is often dropped from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of c is unity for example if the momentum p of an electron is said to be 69901602176487000001gev then the conversion to mks can be achieved by distance in particle physics a system of natural units in which the speed of light in vacuum c and the reduced planck constant are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used c 1 in these units both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units while energy and mass are expressed in the same units see massenergy equivalence in particular particle scattering lengths are often presented in units of inverse particle masses outside this system of units the conversion factors between electronvolt second and nanometer are the following the above relations also allow expressing the mean lifetime of an unstable particle in seconds in terms of its decay width in ev via for example the b meson has a lifetime of 15309picoseconds mean decay length is c 69964596999999999994597m or a decay width of 697768925632470740043022510ev conversely the tiny meson mass differences responsible for meson oscillations are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds energy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy 1 ev 806554400549 cm temperature in certain fields such as plasma physics it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature the conversion to the kelvin scale is defined by using kb the boltzmann constant for example a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is 698524032647304999915kev or 170mk as an approximation kbt is about 69794005441217500000025ev 290 k11604 kev at a
