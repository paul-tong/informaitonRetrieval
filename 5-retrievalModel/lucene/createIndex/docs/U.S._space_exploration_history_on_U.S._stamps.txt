with the advent of unmanned and manned space flight a new era of american history had presented itself keeping with the tradition of honoring the countrys history on us postage stamps the us post office began honoring the various events with its commemorative postage stamp issues the first us postage issue to depict a us space vehicle was issued in 1948 the fort bliss issue the first issue to commemorate a space project by name was the echo i communications satellite commemorative issue of 1960 next was the project mercury issue of 1962 as us space exploration progressed a variety of other commemorative issues followed many of which bear accurate depictions of satellites space capsules apollo lunar modules space suits and other items of interest space exploration history is a popular topic as record numbers of first-day covers for postage stamps with space themes will attest the project mercury issue of 1962 had more than three million first day of issue cancellations while the average number of first-day cancels for other commemorative issues at that time was around half a million in 1969 the apollo viii issue received 900000 first-day cancels while others received less than half this amount as the advent of us space exploration grew so did the topic of space exploration on stamps fort bliss 100th anniversary issue of 1948 fort bliss has a long and diverse history and functioned in many capacities over the years by february 1946 over 100 operation paperclip scientists had arrived from nazi germany to develop rockets and were attached to the office of the chief of ordnance corps research and development service suboffice rocket headed by major james p hamill this stamp was issued on the 100th anniversary of fort bliss in el paso texas in its honor third assistant postmaster general joseph l lawler dedicated the stamp in el paso on november 5 1948 the issue depicts what appears to be a rocket designed after the v-2 in the center which technically makes it a space stamp in the topographical world of philately based on findings made by dr robert goddard following world war i the germans hit a peak production of v-2s during 1944 and 1945 at peenemunde when they arrived in the united states at fort bliss they brought with them the knowledge of the v-2 and as such the us made arrangements with these scientists and employed their knowledge in developing rockets at fort bliss in post war united states it was this effort that led the way to the successful production of the great rockets that carried satellites and astronauts into space the stamps designer charles r chickering intended the issue to salute the old as well as the new fort bliss and portray some of the highlights of the forts hundred-year history chickering of the bureau of engraving and printing designed the stamp ca brooks engraved the vignette and aw christensen engraved the border the lettering and the numerals the quantity issued was 64561000 project echo i issue of 1960 following the failure of the delta rocket carrying echo 1 on may 13 1960 echo 1a commonly referred to as just echo 1 was successfully put into a 944 to 1048mi orbit on august 12 1960 by nasa the 100ft diameter balloon was made of ultra thin 00050in metalized mylar polyester film and was successfully used to reflect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone radio and television signals the satellite also aided in the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio because its shiny surface the large balloon-like satellite was also reflective of visible light rays echo 1a was visible to the naked eye over most of the earth echo 1 was a passive communications satellite it functioned as a reflector not a transmitter after it was placed in a low earth orbit leo a signal would be transmitted from earth to the echo satellite and then reflected or bounced off its surface and then returned to earth it was the pioneer of communications satellites because it was brighter than most stars it was seen by more people than any other man-made object in space at that time upon reentry into earths atmosphere echo 1a burned up on may 24 1968 this was the first space stamp with an actual subject of a real space vessel unlike the generic or symbolic rocket depicted in the fort bliss issue of 1948 the us post office issued this 4-cent echo i communications for peace commemorative stamp through the washington dc post office on december 15 1960 the stamp was produced and issued to honor the worlds first communications satellite designed by ervine metzl the stamp was printed by the rotary process electric-eye perforated and issued in panes of fifty stamps each quantities issued totaled more than 120 million project mercury issue of 1962 project mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the united states it ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the earth the mercury-atlas 6 flight on february 20 1962 was the first mercury flight to achieve this goal the post office department honored this first orbital flight of a united states astronaut on february 20 1962 when it released the project mercury commemorative stamp placed on sale throughout the country at the exact hour colonel john glenns historic flight officially had returned to earth safely the stamp features an image of the mercury friendship 7 capsule circling the earth against a field of stars the spacecraft is now housed at the national air and space museum washington dc because the event was deemed so popular the number of quantities issued totaled more than 289 million more than twice the average amount of quantities issued for commemorative postage issues of that time this issue has somewhat of an unusual history it was one of the first issues printed on the new giori press named after its inventor gualtiero giori it employed a series of specially cut rubber rollers that applied two or three different colored inks on the same printing plate as the new press was being used to print the project mercury stamp before the mission took place and in case the mission failed or was canceled the bureau of engraving and printing kept word about the new press and the stamp issues production a secret to further assure that the project be kept secret the designer of this issue charles r chickering worked from his home and simply claimed that he was away on vacation the stamps waiting at post offices around the us were sealed and marked top secret only after glenns trip were the postmasters allowed to open the package and see what was inside robert h goddard issue of 1964 robert hutchings goddard october 5 1882 august 10 1945 is widely recognized as the father of rocketry as he pioneered the modern propulsion rocket based on his knowledge of math engineering and physics his accomplishments included creating the first rocket propelled using liquid fuel and developing the first rocket to use internal vanes for guidance he launched his first rocket in march 1926 goddard continued to achieve many firsts in the field of rocketry with funding from institutions such as the smithsonian in 1919 the smithsonian institution published robert goddards groundbreaking work a method of reaching extreme altitudes other than from sources like the smithsonian goddard received little public support for his research during his lifetime he was the first to recognize the scientific potential of liquid fuel rockets in space travel and was instrumental in bringing about the design and construction of those rockets needed to implement those ideas though his work in the field was revolutionary he was sometimes ridiculed by the public and in the press for his theories concerning spaceflight and therefore became protective of his privacy and his research work years after his death as manned spaceflight finally became a reality goddard at long last came to be recognized as the man who pioneered modern rocketry and ultimately space exploration on october 5 1964 the us post office issued a postage stamp commemorating robert goddard the stamp depicts an image of goddard next to a rocket launching from the kennedy space center the post office released the stamp issues at a ceremony held in new mexico goddards wife esther goddard attended the ceremony she was given the honor of pressing the button launching two rockets one of which flew some mile and a half into the air the two rockets each carried 1000 first day covers and after parachuting to the ground were recovered with the first day covers later sold to collectors designed by robert j jones and printed on the giori press the quantities for this issue totaled more than 62 million accomplishments in space commemorative issue of 1967 gemini iv was a june 1965 manned space flight in nasas gemini program it was the second manned gemini flight the tenth manned american flight and the 18th spaceflight of all time includes x-15 flights over 100 kilometres 62mi it was crewed by james mcdivitt and ed white the highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an american during which white remained tethered outside the spacecraft for 22 minutes tied to a tether white fired his oxygen powered zip gun and floated out of the capsule he traveled fifteen feet five meters out and began to experiment with maneuvering he found it easy especially the pitch and yaw although he thought the roll would use too much fuel two 5-cent se-tenant stamps comprise one illustration of an astronaut during a space walk honoring the space accomplishments of the united states these issues were first placed on sale on september 29 1967 at kennedy space center in florida the offset press and intaglio press were combined to produce this issue in sheets bearing one horizontal plate number offset printed the red stripes in the flags on the astronauts spacesuit and capsule and light blue sky areas as well as the inscription on the astronaut stamp the giori press printed dark blue sky areas the aqua earth and black tones on the capsule and astronaut the inscription on the spaceship stamp was white this issue was designed by paul calle of stamford connecticut who based his design from photos taken on the gemini iv mission the issue was printed by the bureau of engraving and printing it was issued in panes of fifty with an initial printing of 120 million apollo 8 issue of 1969 up until the time of the apollo 8 mission all manned ventures into space were confined to brief flights into space or to orbiting the earth apollo 8 was the first human spaceflight mission to leave earth orbit the first to be captured by and escape from the gravitational field of another celestial body and the first crew to voyage and then return to planet earth from another celestial body earths moon the three-man crew of mission commander frank borman command module pilot james lovell and lunar module pilot william anders became the first humans to see the far side of the moon with their own eyes as well as the first humans to see planet earth from beyond low earth orbit the mission was accomplished with the first manned launch of a saturn v rocket apollo 8 was the second manned mission of the apollo program while orbiting the moon each man on board read a

making the issue quite common and quite popular some issues are missing the red color resulting in the stripes of the flag emblem on armstrongs arm being omitted making that issue quite scarce and expensive space achievement decade issue of 1971 this space achievements issue depicts the earth sun lunar module the lunar rover and astronauts two 8-cent se-tenant stamps commemorating a decade of space achievements were placed on sale august 2 1971 at kennedy space center florida and houston texas first day covers were postmarked at two different post offices houston texas and huntsville

engineering laboratory was the united states first space station and the second space station visited by a human crew it was put into orbit by a saturn v rocket on 14 may 1973 it was also the only space station nasa launched alone the 100-ton space station was in earths orbit from 1973 to 1979 and it was visited by crews three times in 1973 and 1974 circling 50 degrees north and south of the equator at an altitude of 435 kilometres 270mi skylab had an orbital period of 93 minutes there were a plethora of uv astronomy experiments done during the skylab lifetime as well as detailed x-ray studies of the sun the station was active until july 11 1979 when it fell out of orbit the 10-cent skylab commemorative stamp first day of release took place at houston texas on may 14 1974 this issue commemorates the first anniversary of the launching of skylab and depicts the station as it was repaired complete with umbrella and missing the lost solar panel the stamp was designed by robert t mccall and was issued in sheets of fifty with an initial printing of 140 million pioneer commemorative issue of 1975 in march 1972 scientists at nasa launched pioneer 10 to gather scientific data about the solar systems largest planet jupiter while the vessel was also receiving radio control and guidance signals and other information from earth pioneer 10 was expected to last for 21 months in the solar system and deliver accurate information over that period of time the fastest man made object to enter space from earth the spacecraft was to begin collecting data at the asteroid belt and jupiter and continue to relay information about other areas and phenomena of the solar system after pioneer 10 passed through the asteroid belt pioneer 11 was launched on a similar trajectory pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to get close enough to jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the solar systems largest planet the 10-cent pioneer commemorative stamp

venus and mercury mariner 10 launched in november 1973 the missions two- year plan used the gravitational pull of venus to reach mercury the probe also used solar winds to help with locomotion when fuel ran low mariner 10 orbited the planets in the opposite direction of earths orbit mariners first photographed images which revealed venuss dense cloud cover reached nasa scientists in february 1974 data collected by mariner 10 helped determine venuss rotation period and use of earths magnetic field photos of mercury revealed its cratered surface and its large scarps and plains research also
