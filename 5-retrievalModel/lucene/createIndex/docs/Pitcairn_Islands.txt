the pitcairn islands ptkrn pitkern pitkern ailen officially pitcairn henderson ducie and oeno islands are a group of four volcanic islands in the southern pacific ocean that form the sole british overseas territory in the south pacific the four islands pitcairn proper henderson ducie and oeno are scattered across several hundred miles of ocean and have a combined land area of about 47 square kilometres 18sqmi henderson island accounts for 86 of the land area but only pitcairn island is inhabited the nearest places are mangareva of french polynesia to the west and easter island to the east pitcairn is the least populous national jurisdiction in the world the pitcairn islanders are a biracial ethnic group descended mostly from nine bounty mutineers and the handful of tahitians who accompanied them an event that has been retold in many books and films this history is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders today there are approximately 50 permanent inhabitants originating from four main families history polynesian settlement and extinction the earliest known settlers of the pitcairn islands were polynesians who appear to have lived on pitcairn and henderson and on mangareva island 540 kilometres 340mi to the northwest for several centuries they traded goods and formed social ties among the three islands despite the long canoe voyages between them which helped the small populations on each island survive despite their limited resources eventually important natural resources were exhausted inter-island trade broke down and a period of civil war began on mangareva causing the small human populations on henderson and pitcairn to be cut off and eventually become extinct although archaeologists believe that polynesians were living on pitcairn as late as the 15th century the islands were uninhabited when they were rediscovered by europeans european discovery ducie and henderson islands were discovered by portuguese sailor pedro fernandes de queirs sailing for the spanish crown who arrived on 26january 1606 he named them laencarnacin the incarnation and san juan bautista saint john the baptist respectively however some sources express doubt about exactly which of the islands were visited and named by queirs suggesting that laencarnacin may actually have been henderson island and san juan bautista may have been pitcairn island pitcairn island was sighted on 3july 1767 by the crew of the british sloop hms swallow commanded by captain philip carteret the island was named after midshipman robert pitcairn a fifteen-year-old crew member who was the first to sight the island robert pitcairn was a son of british marine major john pitcairn who later was killed at the 1775 battle of bunker hill in the american revolution carteret who sailed without the newly-invented marine chronometer charted the island at 2502s 13321w 25033s 133350w -25033 -133350 and although the latitude was reasonably accurate his recorded longitude was incorrect by about 3330km 210mi west of the island this made pitcairn difficult to find as highlighted by the failure of captain james cook to locate the island in july1773 european settlement in 1790 nine of the mutineers from the bounty along with the native tahitian men and women who were with them six men eleven women and a baby girl settled on pitcairn islands and set fire to the bounty the wreck is still visible underwater in bounty bay discovered in 1957 by national geographic explorer luis marden although the settlers survived by farming and fishing the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among them alcoholism murder disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and tahitian men john adams and ned young turned to the scriptures using the ships bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society young eventually died of an asthmatic infection ducie island was rediscovered in 1791 by royal navy captain edwards aboard hms pandora while searching for the bounty mutineers he named it after francis reynolds-moreton 3rdbaron ducie also a captain in the royal navy the pitcairn islanders reported it was not until 27december 1795 that the first ship since the bounty was seen from the island but it did not approach the land and they could not make out the nationality a second ship appeared in 1801 but made no attempt to communicate with them a third came sufficiently near to see their house but did not try to send a boat on shore finally the american sealing ship topaz under mayhew folger became the first to visit the island when the crew spent 10hours on pitcairn in february1808 a report of folgers discovery was forwarded to the admiralty mentioning the mutineers and giving a more precise location of the island 2502s 13000w 25033s 130000w -25033 -130000 however this was not known to sirthomas staines who commanded a royal navy flotilla of two ships hmsbriton and hmstagus which found the island at 2504s 13025w 25067s 130417w -25067 -130417 by meridian observation on 17september 1814 staines sent a party ashore and wrote a detailed report for the admiralty by that time only one mutineer john adams remained alive he was granted amnesty for his part in the mutiny henderson island was rediscovered on 17january 1819 by british captain james henderson of the british east india company ship hercules captain henry king sailing on the elizabeth landed on 2march to find the kings colours already flying his crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree oeno island was discovered on 26january 1824 by american captain george worth aboard the whaler oeno in 1832 a church missionary society missionary joshua hill arrived he reported that by march1833 he had founded a temperance society to combat drunkenness a maundy thursday society a monthly prayer meeting a juvenile society a peace society and a school british colony traditionally pitcairn islanders consider that their islands officially became a british colony on 30 november 1838 at the same time becoming one of the first territories to extend voting rights to women by the mid-1850s the pitcairn community was outgrowing the island its leaders appealed to the british government for assistance and were offered norfolk island on 3 may 1856 the entire population of 193 people set sail for norfolk on board the morayshire arriving on 8 june after a difficult five-week trip however just eighteen months later seventeen of the pitcairn islanders returned to their home island and another 27 followed five years later hms thetis visited pitcairn island on 18 april 1881 and found the people very happy and contented and in perfect health at that time the population was 96 an increase of six since the visit of admiral de horsey in september 1878 stores had recently been delivered from friends in england including two whale-boats and portland cement which was used to make the reservoir watertight hms thetis gave the islanders 200lb 91kg of biscuits 100lb 45kg of candles and 100lb 45kg of soap and clothing to the value of 31 donated by the ships company an american trading ship called venus had recently bestowed a supply of cotton seed to provide the islanders with a crop for future trade in 1886 the seventh-day adventist layman john tay visited pitcairn and persuaded most of the islanders to accept his faith he returned in 1890 on the missionary schooner pitcairn with an ordained minister to perform baptisms since then the majority of pitcairn islanders have been adventists the islands of henderson oeno and ducie were annexed by britain in 1902 henderson on 1 july oeno on 10 july and ducie on 19 december in 1938 the three islands along with pitcairn were incorporated into a single administrative unit called the pitcairn group of islands the population peaked at 233 in 1937 it has since reduced owing to emigration primarily to australia and new zealand sexual assault trials of 2004 in 2004 charges were laid against seven men living on pitcairn and six living abroad this accounted for nearly a third of the male population after extensive trials most of the men were convicted some with multiple counts of sexual encounters with children on 25 october 2004 six men were convicted including steve christian the islands mayor at the time in 2004 the islanders had about 20 guns among them which they surrendered ahead of the sexual assault trials after the six men lost their final appeal the british government set up a prison on the island at bobs valley the men began serving their sentences in late 2006 by 2010 all had served their sentences or been granted home detention status 2010 and 2016 trials in 2010 the mayor mike warren faced 25 charges of possessing images and videos of child pornography on his computer in 2016 warren was found guilty of downloading more than 1000 images and videos of child sexual abuse warren began downloading the images some time after the 2004 sexual assault convictions during the time he downloaded the images he was working in child protection warren was also convicted of engaging in a sex chat with someone who he believed was a 15-year-old girl geography the pitcairn islands form the southeasternmost extension of the geological archipelago of the tuamotus of french polynesia and consist of four islands pitcairn island oeno island atoll with five islets one of which is sandy island henderson island and ducie island atoll with four islets the pitcairn islands were formed by a centre of upwelling magma called the pitcairn hotspot the only permanently inhabited island pitcairn is accessible only by boat through bounty bay henderson island covering about 86 of the territorys total land area and supporting a rich variety of animals in its nearly inaccessible interior is also capable of supporting a small human population despite its scarce fresh water but access is difficult owing to its outer shores being steep limestone cliffs covered by sharp coral in 1988 this island was designated as a unesco world heritage site the other islands are at a distance of more than 100km 62mi and are not habitable includes reef flat and

resident land-bird species of 20 breeding species henderson island has 16 including the unique flightless henderson crake oeno hosts 12 ducie 13 and pitcairn six species birds breeding on pitcairn include the fairy tern common noddy and red-tailed tropicbird the pitcairn reed warbler known by pitcairners as a sparrow is endemic to pitcairn island formerly common it was added to the endangered species list in 2008 a small population of humpback whales which has been poorly studied annually migrate to the islands to winter and breed important bird areas the four islands in the pitcairn group have been identified by birdlife international as separate important bird areas ibas pitcairn island is recognised because it is the only nesting site of the pitcairn reed warbler henderson island is important for its endemic land-birds as well as its breeding seabirds oenos ornithological significance derives principally from its murphys petrel colony ducie is important for its colonies of murphys herald and kermadec petrels and christmas shearwaters pitcairn islands marine reserve in march 2015 the british government established one of the largest marine protected areas in the world around the pitcairn islands the reserve covers the islands entire exclusive economic zone 834334 square kilometres 322138sqmi the intention is to protect some of the worlds most pristine ocean habitat from illegal fishing activities a satellite watchroom dubbed project eyes on the seas has been established by the satellite applications catapult and the pew charitable trusts at the harwell science and innovation campus in harwell oxfordshire to monitor vessel activity and to gather the information needed to prosecute unauthorised trawling politics the pitcairn islands are a british overseas territory with a degree of local government the queen of the united kingdom is represented by a governor who also holds office as british high commissioner to new zealand and is based in wellington the 2010 constitution gives authority for the islands to operate as a representative democracy with the united kingdom retaining responsibility for matters such as defence and foreign affairs the governor and the island council may enact laws for the peace order and good government of pitcairn the island council customarily appoints a mayor of pitcairn as a day-to-day head of the local administration there is a commissioner appointed by the governor who liaises between the council and the governors office since 2015 same-sex marriage has been legal on pitcairn island although there are no people on the island known to be in such a relationship the pitcairn islands has the smallest population of any democracy in the world the united nations committee on decolonization includes the pitcairn islands on the united nations list of non-self-governing territories military the pitcairn islands are an overseas territory of the united kingdom defence is the responsibility of the ministry of defence and her majestys armed forces economy agriculture the fertile soil of the pitcairn valleys such as isaacs valley on the gentle slopes southeast of adamstown produces a wide variety of fruits including bananas pitkern plun papaya paw paws pineapples mangoes watermelons cantaloupes passionfruit breadfruit coconuts avocadoes and citrus including mandarin oranges grapefruit lemons and limes vegetables include sweet potatoes kumura carrots sweet corn tomatoes taro yams peas and beans arrowroot maranta arundinacea and sugarcane are grown and harvested to produce arrowroot flour and molasses respectively pitcairn island is remarkably productive and its benign climate supports a wide range of tropical and temperate crops all land allocation for any use including agriculture is under the discretion of the government if the government deems agricultural production excessive then it may tax the land if the agricultural land has been deemed not up to the standards of the government it may confiscate and transfer the land without compensation fish are plentiful in the seas around pitcairn spiny lobster and a large variety of fish are caught for meals and for trading aboard passing ships almost every day someone will go fishing whether it is from the rocks from a longboat or diving with a spear gun there are numerous types of fish around the island fish such as nanwee white fish moi and opapa are caught in shallow water while snapper big eye and cod are caught in deep water and yellow tail and wahoo are caught by trawling minerals manganese iron copper gold silver and zinc have been discovered within the exclusive economic zone which extends 370km 230mi offshore and comprises 880000km 340000sqmi honey production in 1998 the uks overseas aid agency the department for international development funded an apiculture programme for pitcairn which included training for pitcairns beekeepers and a detailed analysis of pitcairns bees and honey with particular regard to the presence or absence of disease pitcairn has one of the best examples of disease-free bee populations anywhere in the world and the honey produced was and remains exceptionally high in quality pitcairn bees are also a placid variety and within a short time beekeepers are able to work with them wearing minimal protection as a result pitcairn exports honey to new zealand and to the united kingdom in london fortnum mason sells it and it is a favourite of queen elizabeth and prince charles the pitcairn islanders under the bounty products and delectable bounty brands also export dried fruit including bananas papayas pineapples and mangoes to new zealand honey production and all honey related products are a protected monopoly all funds and management are under the supervision and discretion of the government cuisine cuisine is not very developed because only 50 people live on pitcairn the most traditional meal is pota mash from palm leaves and coconut domestic tropical plants are abundantly used these include basil breadfruit sugar cane coconut bananas and beans meat courses consist mainly of fish and beef a palm leaf is used in the pictured cuisine because most of the population is from the uk the cuisine is influenced by british cuisine for example the meat pie the cuisine of norfolk island is very similar to that of the pitcairn islands as norfolk islanders trace their origins to pitcairn the local cuisine is a blend of british cuisine and tahitian cuisine recipes from norfolk island of pitcairn origin include mudda green banana dumplings and kumara pilhi the islands cuisine also includes foods not found on pitcairn such as chopped salads and fruit pies from the influences of american whalers tourism tourism plays a major role on pitcairn tourism is the focus for building the economy it focuses on small groups coming by charter vessel and staying at home stays about ten times a year passengers from expedition-type cruise ships come ashore for a day weather permitting since 2009 the government has been operating the mv claymore ii as the islands only dedicated passengercargo vessel providing adventure tourism holidays to pitcairn for three-day or ten-day visits tourists stay with local families and experience the islands culture while contributing to the local economy providing accommodation is a growing source of revenue and some families have invested in private self-contained units adjacent to their homes for tourists to rent entry requirements for short stays up to 14 days which do not require a visa and for longer stays that do require prior clearance are explained in official documents all persons under 16 years of age require prior clearance before landing irrespective of the length of stay lesser revenue sources the pitcairners are involved in creating crafts and curios made out of wood from henderson typical woodcarvings include sharks fish whales dolphins turtles vases birds walking sticks book boxes and models of the bounty miro thespesia populnea a dark and durable wood is preferred for carving islanders also produce tapa cloth and painted hattie leaves the major sources of revenue have been the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors pn domain names and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships most of which are on the united kingdom to new zealand route via the panama canal the flow of funds from these revenue sources are from customer to the government to the pitcairners the government holds a monopoly over any article of whatsoever nature made manufactured prepared for sale or produced by any of the inhabitants of pitcairn island electricity diesel generators provide the island with electricity from 7am to 10pm a wind power plant was planned to be installed to help reduce the high cost of power generation associated with the import of diesel but was cancelled in 2013 after a project overrun of three years and a cost of 250000 the only qualified high voltage electricity technician on pitcairn who manages the electricity grid reached the age of 65 in 2014 demographics the islands have suffered a substantial population decline since 1940 and the viability of the islands community is in doubt see potential extinction below the government has tried to attract migrants however these initiatives have not been effective only two children were born on pitcairn in the 21 years prior to 2012 in 2005 shirley and simon young became the first married outsider couple in history to obtain citizenship on pitcairn language most resident pitcairn islanders are descendants of the bounty mutineers and tahitians or other polynesians pitkern is a creole language derived from 18th-century english with elements of the tahitian language it is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside english at the islands only school it is closely related to the creole language norfuk spoken on norfolk island because norfolk was repopulated in the mid-19th century by pitcairners religion the only church building on the island is seventh-day adventist the seventh-day adventist church is not a state religion as no laws concerning its establishment were passed by the local government a successful seventh-day adventist mission in the 1890s was important in shaping pitcairn society in recent years the church population has declined and as of 2000 eight of the then forty islanders attended services regularly but most attend church on special occasions from friday at sunset until saturday at sunset pitcairners observe a day of rest in observance of the sabbath or as a mark of respect for observant adventists the church was built in 1954 and is run by the church board and resident pastor who usually serves a two-year term the sabbath school meets at 10am on saturday mornings and is followed by divine service an hour later on tuesday evenings there is another service in the form of a prayer meeting education education

total resident population of the pitcairn islands was 56 including the six temporary residents an administrator a doctor a police officer and their spouses however the actual permanent resident population was only 49pitcairners spread across 23households it is however rare for all 49 residents to be on-island at the same time it is common for several residents to be off-island for varying lengths of time visiting family for medical reasons or to attend international conferences as of november2013 for instance seven residents were off-island a diaspora survey projected that by 2045 if nothing were done only three people of working age would be left on the island with the rest being very old in addition the survey revealed that residents who had left the island over the past decades showed little interest in coming back of the hundreds of emigrants contacted only 33 were willing to participate in the survey and just three expressed a desire to return as of 2014 the labour force consisted of 31able-bodied persons 17males and 14females between 18 and 64years of age of the 31 just seven are younger than 40 but 18 are over the age of 50 most of the men undertake the more strenuous physical tasks on the island such as crewing the longboats cargo handling and the operation and maintenance of physical assets longboat crew retirement age is 58 there were then 12men aged between 18 and 58 residing on pitcairn each longboat requires a minimum crew of three of the four longboat coxswains two were in their late 50s the pitcairn governments attempts to attract migrants have been unsuccessful since 2013 some 700 make inquiries each year but so far not a single formal settlement application has been received the migrants are prohibited from taking local jobs or claiming benefits for a certain length of time even those with children the migrants are expected to have at least nz30000 per person in savings and are expected to build their own house at average cost of nz140000 it is also possible to bring off-island builders at an additional cost of between nz23000 and nz28000 the average annual cost of living on the island is nz9464 there is however no assurance of the migrants right to remain on pitcairn after their first two years the council must review and reapprove the migrants status the migrants are also required to take part in the unpaid public work to keep the island in order maintain the islands numerous roads and paths build roads navigate the island longboats clean public toilets etc there are also restrictions on bringing children under the age of 16 to the island freight from tauranga to pitcairn on the mv claymore ii pitcairn islands dedicated passenger and cargo ship chartered by the pitcairn government is charged at nz350m for pitcairners and nz1000m for all other freight additionally pitcairners are charged nz3000 for a one-way trip others are charged nz5000 in 2014 the governments pitcairn islands economic report stated that no one will migrate to pitcairn islands for economic reasons as there are limited government jobs a lack of private sector employment as well as considerable competition for the tourism dollar the pitcairners take tourists in turns to accommodate those few tourists who occasionally visit the island as the island remains a british overseas territory at some point the british government may have to make a decision about the islands future culture the once-strict moral codes which prohibited dancing public displays of affection smoking and consumption of alcohol have been relaxed islanders and visitors no longer require a six-month licence to purchase import and consume alcohol there is now one licensed caf and bar on the island and the government store sells alcohol and cigarettes fishing and swimming are two popular recreational activities a birthday celebration or the arrival of a ship or yacht will involve the entire pitcairn community in a public dinner in
