in physics absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter typically the electrons of an atom thus the electromagnetic energy is transformed into internal energy of the absorber for example thermal energy the reduction in intensity of a light wave propagating through a medium by absorption of a part of its photons is often called attenuation usually the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity linear absorption although in certain conditions usually in optics the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through and saturable absorption or nonlinear absorption occurs quantifying absorption there are a number of ways to quantify how quickly and effectively radiation is absorbed in a certain medium for example the absorption coefficient and some closely related derived quantities the attenuation coefficient which is sometimes but not always synonymous with the absorption coefficient molar absorptivity is called molar extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity see also beerlambert law the mass attenuation coefficient is also called mass extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by density the absorption cross section and scattering cross-section are closely related to the absorption and attenuation coefficients respectively extinction in astronomy is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient other measures of radiation absorption are penetration depth and skin effect propagation constant attenuation constant phase constant and complex wavenumber complex refractive index and extinction coefficient complex dielectric constant electrical resistivity and conductivity absorbance also called optical density and optical depth also called optical thickness are two related measures all these quantities measure at least to some extent how well a medium absorbs radiation however practitioners of different fields and techniques tend to conventionally use different quantities drawn from the list above measuring absorption the absorbance of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it instead of being reflected or refracted this may be related to other properties of the object through the beerlambert law precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via absorption spectroscopy where a sample is illuminated from one side and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured a few examples of absorption are ultravioletvisible spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy applications understanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications in radio propagation it is represented in non-line-of-sight propagation in meteorology and climatology global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases such as in the greenhouse effect and land and ocean surfaces see albedo in medicine x-rays are absorbed to different extents by different tissues bone in particular which is the basis for x-ray imaging for example see computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere used in satellite link design in chemistry and materials science because different materials and molecules will absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies which allows for material identification in optics sunglasses colored filters dyes and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb and in what proportions in biology photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of chloroplasts so that the light energy can be converted into chemical energy within sugars and other molecules in physics the d-region of earths ionosphere is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum in nuclear physics absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels densitometry or thickness measurements see also absorption spectroscopy albedo attenuation electromagnetic absorption by water hydroxyl ion absorption optoelectronics photoelectric effect photosynthesis solar cell spectral line total absorption spectroscopy ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy thomas michael e january 2006 optical propagation in linear media atmospheric gases and particles solid-state components and water optical propagation in linear media atmospheric gases and particles oxford university press usa pp3 chapter 1 2 7 bibcode2006oplmbookt isbn978-0-19-509161-8 profhoff ken mellendorf vince calder november 2010 reflection and absorption physics archive - ask a scientist argonne national laboratory retrieved 2010-11-14
