this is a list of exoplanets as of 16february2019 there are 3916 confirmed exoplanets the majority of these planets were discovered by the kepler spacecraft in addition to the confirmed exoplanets there are 2424 potential exoplanets from its first mission that are yet to be confirmed and 473 from its second light mission for yearly lists on physical orbital and other properties as well as on discovery circumstances and other aspects see specific exoplanet lists nomenclature the convention for designating exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the international astronomical union iau for exoplanets orbiting a single star the designation is normally formed by taking the name or more commonly designation of its parent star and adding a lower case letter the first planet discovered in a system is given the designation b the parent star is considered to be a and later planets are given subsequent letters if several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time the closest one to the star gets the next letter followed by the other planets in order of orbital size a provisional iau-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets a limited number of exoplanets have iau-sanctioned proper names other naming systems exist methods of detection astrometry 1 00 direct imaging 44 11 radial velocity 707 182 transit 3029 778 transit-timing variation 15 04 eclipse timing variation 9 02 microlensing 72 19 pulsar timing variation 6 02 pulsation timing variation 2 01 orbital brightness modulation 6 02 about 97 of all the confirmed exoplanets have been discovered by indirect techniques of detection mainly by radial velocity measurements and transit monitoring techniques specific exoplanet lists full list of exoplanets list of exoplanets discovered before 2000 30 list of exoplanets discovered between 20002009 399 list of exoplanets discovered in 2010 98 list of exoplanets discovered in 2011 135 list of exoplanets discovered in 2012 140 list of exoplanets discovered in 2013 123 list of exoplanets discovered in 2014 861 list of exoplanets discovered in 2015 115 list of exoplanets discovered in 2016 1300 list of exoplanets discovered in 2017 149 list of exoplanets discovered in 2018 288 list of exoplanets discovered in 2019 29 see also astronomy portal lists of astronomical objects list of potentially habitable exoplanets list of exoplanet firsts list of exoplanetary host stars list of exoplanets discovered using the kepler spacecraft list of planets observed during keplers k2 mission list of extrasolar candidates for liquid water list of exoplanet extremes list of multiplanetary systems list of nearest exoplanets list of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates list of transiting exoplanets list of named exoplanets the extrasolar planet encyclopaedia catalog listing accessed in 2015-09-28 exoplanet data explorer accessed in 2015-09-28 open exoplanets catalogue retrieved 2017-02-27 wright j t fakhouri o marcy g w han e feng y johnson john asher howard a w fischer d a valenti j a 2011-04-01 the exoplanet orbit database publications of the astronomical society of the pacific 123 412422 arxiv10125676 bibcode2011pasp123412w doi101086659427 issn0004-6280
