jacques cartier french pronunciationak katje breton jakez karter december 31 1491 september 1 1557 was a breton explorer who claimed what is now canada for france jacques cartier was the first european to describe and map the gulf of saint lawrence and the shores of the saint lawrence river which he named the country of canadas after the iroquois names for the two big settlements he saw at stadacona quebec city and at hochelaga montreal island early life jacques cartier was born in 1491 in saint-malo the port on the north-west coast of brittany cartier who was a respectable mariner improved his social status in 1520 by marrying mary catherine des granches member of a leading family his good name in saint-malo is recognized by its frequent appearance in baptismal registers as godfather or witness first voyage 1534 in 1534 two years after the duchy of brittany was formally united with france in the edict of union cartier was introduced to king francis i by jean le veneur bishop of saint-malo and abbot of mont saint-michel at the manoir de brion the king had previously invited although not formally commissioned the florentine explorer giovanni da verrazzano to explore the eastern coast of north america on behalf of france in 1524 le veneur cited voyages to newfoundland and brazil as proof of cartiers ability to lead ships to the discovery of new lands in the new world on april 20 1534 cartier set sail under a commission from the king hoping to discover a western passage to the wealthy markets of asia in the words of the commission he was to discover certain islands and lands where it is said that a great quantity of gold and other precious things are to be found it took him twenty days to sail across the ocean starting on may 10 of that year he explored parts of newfoundland areas that now comprise the canadian atlantic provinces and the gulf of st lawrence during one stop at les aux oiseaux islands of the birds now the rochers-aux-oiseaux federal bird sanctuary northeast of brion island in the magdalen islands his crew slaughtered around 1000 birds most of them great auks extinct since 1852 cartiers first two encounters with aboriginal peoples in canada on the north side of chaleur bay most likely the mikmaq were brief some trading occurred his third encounter took place on the shores of gasp bay with a party of st lawrence iroquoians where on july 24 he planted a cross to claim the land for france the 10-meter cross bearing the words long live the king of france took possession of the territory in the name of the king the change in mood was a clear indication that the iroquoians understood cartiers actions here he kidnapped the two sons of their captain cartier wrote that they later told him this region where they were captured gasp was called by them honguedo the natives captain at last agreed that they could be taken under the condition that they return with european goods to trade cartier returned to france in september 1534 sure that he had reached an asian land second voyage 15351536 jacques cartier set sail for a second voyage on may 19 of the following year with three ships 110 men and his two iroquoian captives reaching the st lawrence he sailed up-river for the first time and reached the iroquoian capital of stadacona where chief donnacona ruled cartier left his main ships in a harbour close to stadacona and used his smallest ship to continue on to hochelaga now montreal arriving on october 2 1535 hochelaga was far more impressive than the small and squalid village of stadacona and a crowd of over a thousand came to the river edge to greet the frenchmen the site of their arrival has been confidently identified as the beginning of the sainte-marie sault where the bridge named after him now stands the expedition could proceed no further as the river was blocked by rapids so certain was cartier that the river was the northwest passage and that the rapids were all that was preventing him from sailing to china that the rapids and the town that eventually grew up near them came to be named after the french word for china la chine the lachine rapids and the town of lachine quebec after spending two days among the people of hochelaga cartier returned to stadacona on october 11 it is not known exactly when he decided to spend the winter of 15351536 in stadacona and it was by then too late to return to france cartier and his men prepared for the winter by strengthening their fort stacking firewood and salting down game and fish from mid-november 1535 to mid-april 1536 the french fleet lay frozen solid at the mouth of the st charles river under the rock of quebec ice was over a fathom 18 m thick on the river with snow four feet 12 m deep ashore to add to the misery scurvy broke out first among the iroquoians and then among the french cartier estimated the number of dead iroquoians at 50 on a visit by domagaya to the french fort cartier inquired and learned from him that a concoction made from a tree known as annedda probably spruce beer or arbor vitae would cure scurvy this remedy likely saved the expedition from destruction allowing 85 frenchmen to survive the winter in his journal cartier states that by mid-february out of 110 that we were not ten were well enough to help the others a pitiful thing to see the frenchmen used up the bark of an entire tree in a week on the cure and the dramatic results prompted cartier to proclaim it a godsend and a miracle ready to return to france in early may 1536 cartier decided to kidnap chief donnacona and take him to france so that he might personally tell the tale of a country further north called the kingdom of saguenay said to be full of gold rubies and other treasures after an arduous trip down the st lawrence and a three-week atlantic crossing cartier and his men arrived in saint-malo on july 15 1536 concluding the second 14-month voyage which was to be cartiers most profitable third voyage 15411542 on october 17 1540 francis ordered the navigator jacques cartier to return to canada to lend weight to a colonization project of which he would be captain general however january 15 1541 saw cartier supplanted by jean-franois de la rocque de roberval a huguenot courtier and friend of the king named as the first lieutenant general of french canada roberval was to lead the expedition with cartier as his chief navigator while roberval waited for artillery and supplies he gave permission to cartier to sail on ahead with his ships on may 23 1541 cartier departed saint-malo on his third voyage with five ships this time any thought of finding a passage to the orient was forgotten the goals were now to find the kingdom of saguenay and its riches and to establish a permanent settlement along the st lawrence river anchoring at stadacona cartier again met the iroquoians but found their show of joy and their numbers worrisome and decided not to build his settlement there sailing a few kilometres up-river to a spot he had previously observed he decided to settle on the site of present-day cap-rouge quebec the convicts and other colonists were landed the cattle that had survived three months aboard ship were turned loose earth was broken for a kitchen garden and seeds of cabbage turnip and lettuce were planted a fortified settlement was thus created and was named charlesbourg-royal another fort was also built on the cliff overlooking the settlement for added protection the men also began collecting what they believed to be diamonds and gold but which upon return to france were discovered to be merely quartz crystals and iron pyrites respectively which gave rise to a french expression faux comme les diamants du canada as false as canadian diamonds two of the ships were sent on their journey home with some of these minerals on september 2 having set tasks for everyone cartier left with the longboats for a reconnaissance in search of saguenay on september 7 having reached hochelaga he was prevented by bad weather and the numerous rapids from continuing up to the ottawa river returning to charlesbourg-royal cartier found the situation ominous the iroquoians no longer made friendly visits or peddled fish and game but prowled about in a sinister manner no records exist about the winter of 15411542 and the information must be gleaned from the few details provided by returning sailors it seems the natives attacked and killed about 35 settlers before the frenchmen could retreat behind their fortifications even though scurvy was cured through the native remedy thuja occidentalis infusion the impression left is of a general misery and of cartiers growing conviction that he had insufficient manpower either to protect his base or to go in search of the saguenay kingdom cartier left for france in early june 1542 encountering roberval and his ships along the newfoundland coast at about the time roberval marooned marguerite de la rocque despite robervals insistence that he accompany him back to saguenay cartier slipped off under the cover of darkness and continued on to france still convinced his vessels contained a wealth of gold and diamonds he arrived there in october in what proved to be his last voyage meanwhile roberval took command at charlesbourg-royal but it was abandoned in 1543 after disease foul weather and hostile natives drove the would-be settlers to despair later life cartier spent the rest of his life in saint-malo and his nearby estate where he often was useful as an interpreter in portuguese he died at age 65 on september 1 1557 during an epidemic possibly of typhus though many sources list his cause of death as unknown cartier is interred in st vincents cathedral no permanent european settlements were made in canada before 1605 when samuel champlain founded port royal in present-day victoria beach just outside annapolis royal legacy having already located the entrance to the st lawrence on his first voyage he now opened up the greatest waterway for the european penetration of north america he produced an intelligent estimate of the resources of canada both natural and human albeit with a considerable exaggeration of its mineral wealth while some of his actions toward the st lawrence iroquoians were dishonourable he did try at times to establish friendship with them and other native peoples living along the st lawrence riveran indispensable preliminary to french settlement in their lands cartier was the first to document the name canada to designate the territory on the shores of the st-lawrence river the name is derived from the huron-iroquois word kanata or village which was incorrectly interpreted as the native term for the newly discovered land cartier used the name to describe stadacona the surrounding land and the river itself and cartier named canadiens the inhabitants iroquoians he had seen there thereafter the name canada was used to designate the small french colony on these shores and the french colonists were called canadiens until the mid-nineteenth century when the name started to be applied to the loyalist colonies on the great lakes and later to all of british north america in this way cartier is not strictly the european discoverer of canada as this country is understood today a vast federation stretching a mari usque ad mare from sea to sea eastern parts had previously been visited by the norse as well as basque galician and breton fishermen and perhaps the corte-real brothers and john cabot in addition of course to the natives who first inhabited the territory cartiers particular contribution to the discovery of canada is as the first european to penetrate the continent and more precisely the interior eastern region along the st lawrence river his explorations consolidated frances claim of the territory that would later be colonized as new france and his third voyage produced the first documented european attempt at settling north america since that of lucas vzquez de aylln in 152627 cartiers professional abilities can be easily ascertained considering that cartier made three voyages of exploration in dangerous and hitherto unknown waters without losing a ship and that he entered and departed some 50 undiscovered harbors without serious mishap he may be considered one of the most conscientious explorers of the period cartier was also one of the first to formally acknowledge that the new world was a separate land mass from europeasia rediscovery of cartiers first colony on august 18 2006 quebec premier jean charest announced that canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of cartiers lost first colony of charlesbourg-royal the colony was built at the confluence of the rivire du cap rouge with the st lawrence river and is based on the discovery of burnt wooden timber remains that have been dated to the mid-16th century and a fragment of a decorative istoriato plate manufactured in faenza italy between 1540 and 1550 that could only have belonged to a member of the french aristocracy in the colony most probably this was the sieur de roberval who replaced cartier as the leader of the settlement this colony was the first known european settlement in modern-day canada since the c1000 ad lanse aux meadows viking village in northern newfoundland its rediscovery has been hailed by archaeologists as the most important find in canada since the lanse aux meadows rediscovery ships grande hermine built france 1534 given in 1535 to cartier by the king of france used in the 15351536
