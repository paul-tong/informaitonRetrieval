non-human animals in space originally served to test the survivability of spaceflight before human spaceflights were attempted later other non-human animals were flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on them bioastronautics is an area of bioengineering research which spans the study and support of life in space to date seven national space programs have flown animals into space the soviet union the united states france argentina china japan and iran a wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space including monkeys dogs tortoises mice and insects the united states launched flights containing monkeys and primates primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985 france launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967 the soviet union and russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996 during the 1950s and 1960s the soviet space program used a number of dogs for sub-orbital and orbital space flights two tortoises and a variety of insects were the first inhabitants of earth to circle the moon on the 1968 zond 5 mission and five mice traveled in the orbiter of the 1972 apollo 17 mission background animals had been used in aeronautic exploration since 1783 when the montgolfier brothers sent a sheep a duck and a rooster aloft in a hot air balloon to see if ground-dwelling animals can survive the duck serving as the experimental control the limited supply of captured german v-2 rockets led to the us use of high-altitude balloon launches carrying fruit flies mice hamsters guinea pigs cats dogs frogs goldfish and monkeys to heights of up to 44000m 144000ft 27mi these high-altitude balloon flights from 1947 to 1960 tested radiation exposure physiological response life support and recovery systems the us high-altitude manned balloon flights occurred in the same time frame one of which also carried fruit flies 1940s the first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a us-launched v-2 rocket on 20 february 1947 from white sands missile range new mexico the purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes the rocket reached 68 miles 109km in 3 minutes and 10 seconds past both the us air force 50-mile and the international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space the blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute the fruit flies were recovered alive other v-2 missions carried biological samples including moss albert ii a rhesus monkey became the first monkey in space on 14 june 1949 in a us-launched v-2 after the failure of the original alberts mission on ascent albert i reached only 3039 miles 4863km altitude albert ii reached about 83 miles 134km albert ii died on impact after a parachute failure numerous monkeys of several species were flown by the us in the 1950s and 1960s monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs and many were under anesthesia during launch the death rate among monkeys at this stage was very high about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing 1950s on 31 august 1950 the us launched a mouse into space 137km aboard a v-2 the albert v flight which unlike the albert i-iv flights did not have a monkey but the rocket disintegrated because the parachute system failed the us launched several other mice in the 1950s on 22 july 1951 the soviet union launched the r-1 iiia-1 flight carrying the dogs tsygan russian gypsy and dezik russian into space but not into orbit these two dogs were the first living higher organisms successfully recovered from a spaceflight both space dogs survived the flight although one would die on a subsequent flight the us launched mice aboard spacecraft later that year however they failed to reach the altitude for true spaceflight on 3 november 1957 the second-ever orbiting spacecraft carried the first animal into orbit the dog laika launched aboard the soviet sputnik 2 spacecraft nicknamed muttnik in the west laika died during the flight as was intended because the technology to return from orbit had not yet been developed at least 10 other dogs were launched into orbit and numerous others on sub-orbital flights before the historic date of 12 april 1961 when yuri gagarin became the first human in space on 13 december 1958 a jupiter irbm am-13 was launched from cape canaveral florida with a united states navy-trained south american squirrel monkey named gordo on board the nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and gordo was lost telemetry data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the 10g of launch 8 minutes of weightlessness and 40g of reentry at 10000 miles per hour 16000kmh the nose cone sank 1302 nautical miles 2411km downrange from cape canaveral and was not recovered monkeys able and baker became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight on 28 may 1959 aboard jupiter irbm am-18 were a 7-pound 318kg american-born rhesus monkey able from independence kansas and an 11-ounce 310-gram squirrel monkey from peru baker the monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of 360 miles 579km and a distance of 1700 miles 2735km down the atlantic missile range from cape canaveral florida they withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes a top speed of 10000mph 16000kmh was reached during their 16-minute flight the monkeys survived the flight in good condition able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill-effects from her space flight she was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system baker lived until 29 november 1984 at the us space and rocket center in huntsville alabama on 2 july 1959 a launch of a soviet r2 rocket which reached 212 kilometers 132mi carried two space dogs and marfusa the first rabbit to go into space a 19 september 1959 launch jupiter am-23 carried 2 frogs along with 12 mice but the rocket was destroyed during launch 1960s on 19 august 1960 the soviet union launched sputnik 5 also known as korabl-sputnik 2 which carried the dogs belka and strelka along with a gray rabbit 40 mice 2 rats and 15 flasks of fruit flies and plants it was the first spacecraft to carry animals into orbit and return them alive one of strelkas pups pushinka bred and born after her mission was given as a present to caroline kennedy by nikita khrushchev in 1961 and many descendants are known to exist the united states sent three black mice sally amy and moe 1000km up and 8000km distance from cape canaveral on 13 october 1960 using an atlas d 71d launch vehicle the mice were retrieved from the nosecone near ascension island and were said to be in good condition on 31 january 1961 ham the chimp was launched in a mercury capsule aboard a redstone rocket hams mission was mercury-redstone 2 the chimpanzee had been trained to pull levers to receive rewards of banana pellets and avoid electric shocks his flight demonstrated the ability to perform tasks during spaceflight a little over 3 months later the united states sent alan shepard into space enos the chimp became the first chimpanzee in orbit on 29 november 1961 in another mercury capsule an atlas rocket mercury-atlas 5 on 9 march 1961 the soviet union launched the korabl-sputnik 4 that carried a dog named chernushka some mice frogs and for the first time into space a guinea pig all were successfully recovered france flew their first rat hector into space on 22 february 1961 two more rats were flown in october 1962 on 18 october 1963 france launched flicette the cat aboard veronique agi sounding rocket no 47 the launch was directed by the french centre denseignement et de recherches de mdecine aronautique cerma flicette was recovered alive after a 15-minute flight and a descent by parachute flicette had electrodes implanted into her brain and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to earth a second cat was sent to space by cerma on 24 october 1963 but the flight ran into difficulties that prevented recovery the final french animal launches were of two monkeys in march 1967 china launched mice and rats in 1964 and 1965 and two dogs in 1966 during the voskhod program two soviet space dogs veterok little wind and ugolyok blackie were launched on 22 february 1966 on board cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 march this spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until soyuz 11 in 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs the united states launched biosatellite i in 1966 and biosatellite iii in 1967 with fruit flies parasitic wasps flour beetles and frog eggs along with bacteria amoebae plants and fungi on 11 april 1967 argentina also launched the rat belisario atop a yarar rocket from cordoba military range which was recovered successfully this flight was followed by a series of subsequent flights using rats it is unclear if any argentinean biological flights passed the 100km limit of space the first animals in deep space the first to circle the moon and the first two tortoises in space were launched on zond 5 on 14 september 1968 by the soviet union the horsfields tortoises were sent on a circumlunar voyage to the moon along with wine flies meal worms and other biological specimens these were the first inhabitants of earth to travel around the moon the capsule overshot its terrestrial landing site but was successfully recovered at sea on 21 september the animals survived but suffered some weight loss on 28 june 1969 the united states launched the monkey bonny a macaque on biosatellite 3 in what was intended to have been a 30-day orbit around the earth with the monkey being fed by food pellets from a dispenser that he had been trained to operate however bonnys health deteriorated rapidly and he was returned to earth on july 7 but died the next day after the biosatellite capsule was recovered in the pacific ocean in total in the 1950s and 1960s the soviet union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs the actual number of dogs in space is smaller because some dogs flew more than once on 23 december 1969 as part of the operacin navidad operation christmas argentina launched juan a cai monkey native of argentinas misiones province using a canopus ii rocket it ascended 82 kilometers and then was recovered successfully later on 1 february 1970 the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a x-1 panther rocket it reached a higher altitude than its predecessor but it was lost after the capsules parachute failed 1970s two bullfrogs were launched on a one-way mission on the orbiting frog otolith satellite on 9 november 1970 to understand more about space motion sickness apollo 16 on 16 april 1972 carried nematodes and apollo 17 launched on 7 december 1972 carried five pocket mice fe fi fo fum and phooey although one died on the circumlunar trip skylab 3 carried pocket mice and the first fish in space a mummichog and the first spiders in space garden spiders named arabella and anita mummichog were also flown by the us on the apollo-soyuz joint mission launched 15 july 1975 the soviets flew several bion program missions which consisted of satellites with biological cargoes on these launches they flew tortoises rats and mummichog on soyuz 20 launched 17 november 1975 tortoises set the duration record for an animal in space when they spent 905 days in space salyut 5 on 22 june 1976 carried tortoises and a fish a zebra danio 1980s the soviet union sent eight monkeys into space in the 1980s on bion flights in 1985 the us sent two squirrel monkeys aboard spacelab 3 on the space shuttle with 24 male albino rats and stick insect eggs bion flights also flew zebra danio fruit flies rats stick insect eggs and the first newts in space bion 7 1985 had 10 newts pleurodeles waltl on board the newts had part of their front limbs amputated to study the rate of regeneration in space knowledge to understand human recovery from space injuries after an experiment was lost in the space shuttle challenger disaster chicken embryos fertilized eggs were sent into space in an experiment on sts-29 in 1989 the experiment was designed for a student contest 1990s four monkeys flew aboard the last bion flights of the soviet union as well as frogs and fruit flies the foton program flights carried dormant brine shrimp artemia franciscana newts fruit flies and sand desert beetles trigonoscelis gigas china launched guinea pigs in 1990 toyohiro akiyama a japanese journalist carried japanese tree frogs with him during his trip to the mir space station in december 1990 other biological experiments aboard mir involved quail eggs japan launched its first animals a species of newt into space on 18 march 1995 aboard the space flyer unit during the 1990s the us carried crickets mice rats frogs newts fruit flies snails carp medaka oyster toadfish sea urchins swordtail fish gypsy moth eggs stick insect eggs brine shrimp artemia salina quail eggs and jellyfish aboard space shuttles 2000s the last flight of columbia in 2003 carried silkworms garden orb spiders carpenter bees harvester ants and japanese killifish medaka nematodes c elegans from one experiment were found still alive in the debris after the space shuttle columbia disaster c elegans are also part of experiments aboard the international space station as well as research using quail eggs earlier space shuttle missions included grade school junior high and high school projects some of these included ants stick insect eggs and brine shrimp cysts other science missions included gypsy moth eggs on 12 july 2006 bigelow aerospace launched their genesis i inflatable space module containing many small items such as toys and simple experiments chosen by company employees that would be observed via camera these items included insects perhaps making it the first private flight to launch animals into space included were madagascar hissing cockroaches and mexican jumping beans seeds containing live larvae of the moth cydia deshaisiana on 28 june 2007 bigelow launched genesis ii a near-twin to genesis i this spacecraft also carried madagascar hissing cockroaches and added south african flat rock scorpions hadogenes troglodytes and seed-harvester ants pogonomyrmex californicus in september 2007 during the european space agencys foton-m3 mission tardigrades also known as water-bears were able to survive 10 days of exposure to open-space with only their natural protection on the same mission a number of cockroaches were carried inside a sealed container and at least one of the females conceived during the mission after they were returned to earth the one named nadezhda became the first earth creature to produce young that had been conceived in space on 15 march 2009 during the countdown of the sts-119 a free-tailed bat was seen clinging to the fuel tank nasa observers believed the bat would fly off once the shuttle started to launch but it did not upon analyzing the images a wildlife expert who provided support to the center said it likely had a broken left wing and some problem with its right shoulder or wrist the animal most likely perished quickly during discoverys climb into orbit in november 2009 sts-129 took painted lady and monarch butterfly larvae into space for a school experiment as well as thousands of c elegans roundworms for long-term weight loss studies 2010s on 3 february 2010 on the 31st anniversary of its revolution iran became the latest country to launch animals into space the animals a mouse two turtles and some worms were launched on top of the kavoshgar 3 rocket and returned alive to earth in may 2011 the last flight of space shuttle endeavour sts-134 carried two golden orb spiders named gladys and esmeralda as well as a fruit fly colony as their food source in order to study the effects of microgravity on spiders behavior tardigrades and extremophiles were also sent into orbit in november 2011 the living interplanetary flight experiment on the fobos-grunt mission planned to carry tardigrades to mars and back however the mission failed to leave earth orbit in october 2012 32 medaka fish were delivered to the international space station by soyuz tma-06m for the new aquatic habitat in the kibo module on 28 january 2013 iranian news agencies reported that iran sent a monkey in a pishgam rocket to a height of 72 miles 116km and retrieved a shipment later irans space research website uploaded an 18-minute video the video was uploaded later on youtube in january 2014 the search strategies of pavement ants were studied on the iss on 19 july 2014 russia announced that they launched their foton-m4 satellite into low earth orbit 575 kilometers with one male and four female geckos possibly gold dust day geckos as the payload this was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles on 24 july 2014 it was announced that russia had lost control of the foton-m4 satellite leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos food supply was exhausted control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 july 2014 on 1 september 2014 russia confirmed the death of all five geckos stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death russia is said to have appointed an emergency commission to investigate the animals deaths on 23 september 2014 the spacex crs-4 mission delivered 20 mice to live on the iss for study of the long-term effects of microgravity on the rodents this was the first use of the rodent research hardware system on 14 april 2015 the spacex crs-6 delivered 20 c57bl6ntac mice to live on the iss for evaluating microgravity as the extreme opposite of a healthy active lifestyle in the absence of gravity astronauts are subject to a decrease in muscle bone and tendon mass although were not out to treat couch potatoes states head novartis institute for biomedical research nibr scientist on the project dr sam cadena were hoping that these experiments will help us to better understand muscle loss in populations where physical activity in any form is not an option eg in the frail elderly or those subjected to bed rest or immobilization due to surgery or chronic disease on 8 april 2016 rodent research 3 delivered 20 mice on spacex crs-8 the experiment sponsored by eli lilly and co was a study of myostatin inhibition for the prevention of skeletal and muscle atrophy and weakness mice are known to suffer from rapid loss of muscle and bone mass after as little as 12 days of space flight exposure the mice were euthanized and dissected on the station and then frozen for eventual return to earth for further study on 29 june 2018 a spacex dragon spaceship blasted off from florida carrying 20 mice the rodent crew arrived at the iss on 2 july 2018 their record-breaking journey this was the longest mice have been off the planet was part of a study on how earth-dwellers physiology and sleep schedules responded to the stress of being in space the chinese lunar lander change 4 carries a 3 kg sealed container with seeds and insect eggs to test whether plants and insects could hatch and grow together in synergy the experiment includes six types of organisms cottonseed potato rapeseed arabidopsis thaliana a flowering plant as well as yeast and fruit fly eggs if the eggs hatch the larvae would produce carbon dioxide while the germinated plants would release oxygen through photosynthesis a miniature camera is imaging the growth see
