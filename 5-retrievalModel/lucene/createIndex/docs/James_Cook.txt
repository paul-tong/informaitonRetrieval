captain james cook frs 7 november 1728 14 february 1779 was a british explorer navigator cartographer and captain in the royal navy he made detailed maps of newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the pacific ocean during which he achieved the first recorded european contact with the eastern coastline of australia and the hawaiian islands and the first recorded circumnavigation of new zealand cook joined the british merchant navy as a teenager and joined the royal navy in 1755 he saw action in the seven years war and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the saint lawrence river during the siege of quebec which brought him to the attention of the admiralty and royal society this acclaim came at a crucial moment in his career and the direction of british overseas exploration and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of hm barkendeavour for the first of three pacific voyages in three voyages cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe he mapped lands from new zealand to hawaii in the pacific ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved as he progressed in his voyages of discovery he surveyed and named features and recorded islands and coastlines on european maps for the first time he displayed a combination of seamanship superior surveying and cartographic skills physical courage and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions cook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the pacific while attempting to kidnap hawaiian chief kalanipuu in order to reclaim a cutter stolen from one of his ships he left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which influenced his successors well into the 20thcentury and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him early life and family james cook was born on 7 november 1728 ns in the village of marton in yorkshire and baptised on 14 november ns in the parish church of st cuthbert where his name can be seen in the church register he was the second of eight children of james cook 16931779 a scottish farm labourer from ednam in roxburghshire and his locally born wife grace pace 17021765 from thornaby-on-tees in 1736 his family moved to airey holme farm at great ayton where his fathers employer thomas skottowe paid for him to attend the local school in 1741 after five years schooling he began work for his father who had been promoted to farm manager despite not being formally educated he became capable in mathematics astronomy and charting by the time of his endeavour voyage for leisure he would climb a nearby hill roseberry topping enjoying the opportunity for solitude cooks cottage his parents last home which he is likely to have visited is now in melbourne australia having been moved from england and reassembled brick by brick in 1934 in 1745 when he was 16 cook moved 20 miles 32km to the fishing village of staithes to be apprenticed as a shop boy to grocer and haberdasher william sanderson historians have speculated that this is where cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out of the shop window after 18 months not proving suitable for shop work cook travelled to the nearby port town of whitby to be introduced to friends of sandersons john and henry walker the walkers who were quakers were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade their house is now the captain cook memorial museum cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels plying coal along the english coast his first assignment was aboard the collier freelove and he spent several years on this and various other coasters sailing between the tyne and london as part of his apprenticeship cook applied himself to the study of algebra geometry trigonometry navigation and astronomyall skills he would need one day to command his own ship his three-year apprenticeship completed cook began working on trading ships in the baltic sea after passing his examinations in 1752 he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks starting with his promotion in that year to mate aboard the collier brig friendship in 1755 within a month of being offered command of this vessel he volunteered for service in the royal navy when britain was re-arming for what was to become the seven years war despite the need to start back at the bottom of the naval hierarchy cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the navy at wapping on 17 june 1755 cook married elizabeth batts the daughter of samuel batts keeper of the bell inn in wapping and one of his mentors on 21 december 1762 at st margarets church barking essex the couple had six children james 17631794 nathaniel 17641780 lost aboard hmsthunderer which foundered with all hands in a hurricane in the west indies elizabeth 17671771 joseph 17681768 george 17721772 and hugh 17761793 who died of scarlet fever while a student at christs college cambridge when not at sea cook lived in the east end of london he attended st pauls church shadwell where his son james was baptised cook has no direct descendantsall of his children died before having children of their own start of royal navy career cooks first posting was with hmseagle serving as able seaman and masters mate under captain joseph hamar for his first year aboard and captain hugh palliser thereafter in october and november 1755 he took part in eagles capture of one french warship and the sinking of another following which he was promoted to boatswain in addition to his other duties his first temporary command was in march 1756 when he was briefly master of cruizer a small cutter attached to eagle while on patrol in june 1757 cook formally passed his masters examinations at trinity house deptford qualifying him to navigate and handle a ship of the kings fleet he then joined the frigate hmssolebay as master under captain robert craig newfoundland during the seven years war cook served in north america as master aboard the fourth-rate navy vessel hmspembroke with others in pembrokes crew he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the fortress of louisbourg from the french in 1758 and in the siege of quebec city in 1759 throughout his service he demonstrated a talent for surveying and cartography and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the saint lawrence river during the siege thus allowing general wolfe to make his famous stealth attack during the 1759 battle of the plains of abraham cooks surveying ability was also put to use in mapping the jagged coast of newfoundland in the 1760s aboard hmsgrenville he surveyed the northwest stretch in 1763 and 1764 the south coast between the burin peninsula and cape ray in 1765 and 1766 and the west coast in 1767 at this time cook employed local pilots to point out the rocks and hidden dangers along the south and west coasts during the 1765 season four pilots were engaged at a daily pay of 4 shillings each john beck for the coast west of great st lawrence morgan snook for fortune bay john dawson for connaigre and hermitage bay and john peck for the bay of despair his five seasons in newfoundland produced the first large-scale and accurate maps of the islands coasts and were the first scientific large scale hydrographic surveys to use precise triangulation to establish land outlines they also gave cook his mastery of practical surveying achieved under often adverse conditions and brought him to the attention of the admiralty and royal society at a crucial moment both in his career and in the direction of british overseas discovery cooks map were used into the 20th century with copies being referenced by those sailing newfoundlands waters for 200 years following on from his exertions in newfoundland cook wrote that he intended to go not only farther than any man has been before me but as far as i think it is possible for a man to go voyages of exploration first voyage 176871 on 25 may 1768 the admiralty commissioned cook to command a scientific voyage to the pacific ocean the purpose of the voyage was to observe and record the 1769 transit of venus across the sun which when combined with observations from other places would help to determine the distance of the sun cook at age 39 was promoted to lieutenant to grant him sufficient status to take the command for its part the royal society agreed that cook would receive a one hundred guinea gratuity in addition to his naval pay the expedition sailed aboard hmsendeavour departing england on 26 august 1768 cook and his crew rounded cape horn and continued westward across the pacific arriving at tahiti on 13 april 1769 where the observations of the venus transit were made however the result of the observations was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped once the observations were completed cook opened the sealed orders which were additional instructions from the admiralty for the second part of his voyage to search the south pacific for signs of the postulated rich southern continent of terra australis cook then sailed to new zealand and mapped the complete coastline making only some minor errors he then voyaged west reaching the southeastern coast of australia on 19 april 1770 and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline on 23 april he made his first recorded direct observation of indigenous australians at brush island near bawley point noting in his journal and were so near the shore as to distinguish several people upon the sea beach they appeard to be of a very dark or black colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the clothes they might have on i know not on 29 april cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the kurnell peninsula cook originally christened the area as stingray bay but later he crossed this out and named it botany bay after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists joseph banks and daniel solander it is here that james cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the gweagal after his departure from botany bay he continued northwards he stopped at bustard bay now known as seventeen seventy on 23 may 1770 on 24 may cook and banks and others went ashore continuing north on 11 june a mishap occurred when endeavour ran aground on a shoal of the great barrier reef and then nursed into a river mouth on 18 june 1770 the ship was badly damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach near the docks of modern cooktown queensland at the mouth of the endeavour river the voyage then continued and at about midday on 22 august 1770 they reached the northernmost tip of the coast and without leaving the ship cook named it cape york leaving the east coast cook turned west and nursed his battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of torres strait searching for a high vantage point cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see a passage into the indian seas he climbed the hill with three others including joseph banks on seeing a navigable passage he signalled the good news down to the men on the ship who cheered loudly cook later wrote that he had claimed possession of the east coast when up on that hill and named the place possession island however the admiraltys instructions did not authorise cook to annex new holland australia and therefore it is unlikely that any possession ceremony occurred that august importantly joseph banks who was standing beside cook does not mention any such episode or announcement in his journal cook re-wrote his journal on his arrival in batavia jakarta when he was confronted with the news that the frenchman louis bougainville had sailed across the pacific the previous year in his revised journal entry cook wrote that he had claimed the entire coastline that he had just explored as british territory he returned to england via batavia modern jakarta indonesia where many in his crew succumbed to malaria and then the cape of good hope arriving at the island of saint helena on 12 july 1771 interlude cooks journals were published upon his return and he became something of a hero among the scientific community among the general public however the aristocratic botanist joseph banks was a greater hero banks even attempted to take command of cooks second voyage but removed himself from the voyage before it began and johann reinhold forster and his son georg forster were taken on as scientists for the voyage cooks son george was born five days before he left for his second voyage second voyage 177275 shortly after his return from the first voyage cook was promoted in august 1771 to the rank of commander in 1772 he was commissioned to lead another scientific expedition on behalf of the royal society to search for the hypothetical terra australis on his first voyage cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating new zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south although he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of australia showing it to be continental in size the terra australis was believed to lie further south despite this evidence to the contrary alexander dalrymple and others of the royal society still believed that a massive southern continent should exist cook commanded hmsresolution on this voyage while tobias furneaux commanded its companion ship hmsadventure cooks expedition circumnavigated the globe at an extreme southern latitude becoming one of the first to cross the antarctic circle on 17 january 1773 in the antarctic fog resolution and adventure became separated furneaux made his way to new zealand where he lost some of his men during an encounter with mori and eventually sailed back to britain while cook continued to explore the antarctic reaching 7110s on 31 january 1774 cook almost encountered the mainland of antarctica but turned towards tahiti to resupply his ship he then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent on this leg of the voyage he brought a young tahitian named omai who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the pacific than tupaia had been on the first voyage on his return voyage to new zealand in 1774 cook landed at the friendly islands easter island norfolk island new caledonia and vanuatu before returning to england cook made a final sweep across the south atlantic from cape horn and surveyed mapped and took possession for britain of south georgia which had been explored by the english merchant anthony de la roch in 1675 cook also discovered and named clerke rocks and the south sandwich islands sandwich land he then turned north to south africa and from there continued back to england his reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of terra australis cooks second voyage marked a successful employment of larcum kendalls k1 copy of john harrisons h4 marine chronometer which enabled cook to calculate his longitudinal position with much greater accuracy cooks log was full of praise for this time-piece which he used to make charts of the southern pacific ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20thcentury upon his return cook was promoted to the rank of post-captain and given an honorary retirement from the royal navy with a posting as an officer of the greenwich hospital he reluctantly accepted insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise his fame extended beyond the admiralty he was made a fellow of the royal society and awarded the copley gold medal for completing his second voyage without losing a man to scurvy nathaniel dance-holland painted his portrait he dined with james boswell he was described in the house of lords as the first navigator in europe but he could not be kept away from the sea a third voyage was planned and cook volunteered to find the northwest passage he travelled to the pacific and hoped to travel east to the atlantic while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route third voyage 177679 on his last voyage cook again commanded hms resolution while captain charles clerke commanded hmsdiscovery the voyage was ostensibly planned to return the pacific islander omai to tahiti or so the public was led to believe the trips principal goal was to locate a northwest passage around the american continent after dropping omai at tahiti cook travelled north and in 1778 became the first european to begin formal contact with the hawaiian islands after his initial landfall in january 1778 at waimea harbour kauai cook named the archipelago the sandwich islands after the fourth earl of sandwichthe acting first lord of the admiralty from the sandwich islands cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of north america north of the spanish settlements in alta california he made landfall on the oregon coast at approximately 4430 north latitude naming his landing point cape foulweather bad weather forced his ships south to about 43 north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward he unknowingly sailed past the strait of juan de fuca and soon after entered nootka sound on vancouver island he anchored near the first nations village of yuquot cooks two ships remained in nootka sound from 29 march to 26 april 1778 in what cook called ship cove now resolution cove at the south end of bligh island relations between cooks crew and the people of yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained in trading the people of yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had worked in hawaii metal objects were much desired but the lead pewter and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute the most valuable items which the british received in trade were sea otter pelts during the stay the yuquot hosts essentially controlled the trade with the british vessels the natives usually visited the british vessels at resolution cove instead of the british visiting the village of yuquot at friendly cove after leaving nootka sound cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the bering strait on the way identifying what came to be known as cook inlet in alaska in a single visit cook charted the majority of the north american northwest coastline on world maps for the first time determined the extent of alaska and closed the gaps in russian from the west and spanish from the south exploratory probes of the northern limits of the pacific by the second week of august 1778 cook was through the bering strait sailing into the chukchi sea he headed northeast up the coast of alaska until he was blocked by sea ice his furthest north was 70 degrees 44 minutes cook then sailed west to the siberian coast and then southeast down the siberian coast back to the bering strait by early september 1778 he was back in the bering sea to begin the trip to the sandwich hawaiian islands he became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew such as forcing them to eat walrus meat which they had pronounced inedible return to hawaii cook returned to hawaii in 1779 after sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks he made landfall at kealakekua bay on hawaii island largest island in the hawaiian archipelago cooks arrival coincided with the makahiki a hawaiian harvest festival of worship for the polynesian god lono coincidentally the form of cooks ship hms resolution or more particularly the mast formation sails and rigging resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship similarly cooks clockwise route around the island of hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the lono festivals it has been argued most extensively by marshall sahlins that such coincidences were the reasons for cooks and to a limited extent his crews initial deification by some hawaiians who treated cook as an incarnation of lono though this view was first suggested by members of cooks expedition the idea that any hawaiians understood cook to be lono and the evidence presented in support of it were challenged in 1992 death after a months stay cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern pacific shortly after leaving hawaii island however resolutions foremast broke so the ships returned to kealakekua bay for repairs tensions rose and a number of quarrels broke out between the europeans and hawaiians at kealakekua bay an unknown group of hawaiians took one of cooks small boats the evening when the cutter was taken the people had become insolent even with threats to fire upon them cook attempted to kidnap and ransom the king of hawaii kalanipuu the following day 14 february 1779 cook marched through the village to retrieve the king cook took the king alii nui by his own hand and led him willingly away one of kalanipuus favourite wives kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats they pleaded with the king not to go an old kahuna priest chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut attempted to distract cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore the king began to understand that cook was his enemy as cook turned his back to help launch the boats he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf he was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named kalaimanokahoowaha or kanaina namesake of charles kanaina and then stabbed by one of the kings attendants nuaa the hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town still visible to the ship through their spyglass four marines corporal james thomas private theophilus hinks private thomas fatchett and private john allen were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation aftermath the esteem which the islanders nevertheless held for cook caused them to retain his body following their practice of the time they prepared his body with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest elders of the society the body was disembowelled baked to facilitate removal of the flesh and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as religious icons in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the treatment of european saints in the middle ages some of cooks remains thus preserved were eventually returned to his crew for a formal burial at sea clerke assumed leadership of the expedition and made a final attempt to pass through the bering strait he died of tuberculosis on 22 august 1779 and john gore a veteran of cooks first voyage took command of resolution and of the expedition james king replaced gore in command of discovery the expedition returned home reaching england in october 1780 after their arrival in england king completed cooks account of the voyage david samwell who sailed with cook on resolution wrote of him he was a modest man and rather bashful of an agreeable lively conversation sensible and intelligent in temper he was somewhat hasty but of a disposition the most friendly benevolent and humane his person was above six feet high and though a good looking man he was plain both in dress and appearance his face was full of expression his nose extremely well shaped his eyes which were small and of a brown cast were quick and piercing his eyebrows prominent which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity legacy ethnographic collections the australian museum acquired its cook collection in 1894 from the government of new south wales at that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on cooks three voyages throughout the pacific ocean during the period 176880 along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages many of the ethnographic artifacts were collected at a time of first contact between pacific peoples and europeans in 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the mitchell library in the state library of new south wales the provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of cooks widow elizabeth cook and her descendants until 1886 in this year john mackrell the great-nephew of isaac smith elizabeth cooks cousin organised the display of this collection at the request of the nsw government at the colonial and indian exhibition in london in 1887 the london-based agent-general for the new south wales government saul samuel bought john mackrells items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives reverend canon frederick bennett mrs thomas langton hmc alexander and william adams the collection remained with the colonial secretary of nsw until 1894 when it was transferred to the australian museum navigation and science cooks 12 years sailing around the pacific ocean contributed much to european knowledge of the area several islands such as the sandwich islands hawaii were encountered for the first time by europeans and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the pacific was a major achievement to create accurate maps latitude and longitude must be accurately determined navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a backstaff or quadrant longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth the earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day thus longitude corresponds to time 15 degrees every hour or 1 degree every 4 minutes cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage by his navigational skills the help of astronomer charles green and by using the newly published nautical almanac tables via the lunar distance methodmeasuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the royal observatory greenwich and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun moon or stars on his second voyage cook used the k1 chronometer made by larcum kendall which was the shape of a large pocket watch 5 inches 13cm in diameter it was a copy of the h4 clock made by john harrison which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship deptfords journey to jamaica in 176162 cook succeeded in circumnavigating the world on his first voyage without losing a single man to scurvy an unusual accomplishment at the time he tested several preventive measures but the most important was frequent replenishment of fresh food it was for presenting a paper on this aspect of the voyage to the royal society that he was presented with the copley medal in 1776 ever the observer cook was the first european to have extensive contact with various people of the pacific he correctly postulated a link among all the pacific peoples despite their being separated by great ocean stretches see malayo-polynesian languages cook theorised that polynesians originated from asia which scientist bryan sykes later verified in new zealand the coming of cook is often used to signify the onset of colonisation cook carried several scientists on his voyages they made significant observations and discoveries two botanists joseph banks and swede daniel solander were on the first voyage the two collected over 3000 plant species banks subsequently strongly promoted british settlement of australia artists also sailed on cooks first voyage sydney parkinson was heavily involved in documenting the botanists findings completing 264 drawings before his death near the end of the voyage they were of immense scientific value to british botanists cooks second expedition included william hodges who produced notable landscape paintings of tahiti easter island and other locations several officers who served under cook went on to distinctive accomplishments william bligh cooks sailing master was given command of hmsbounty in 1787 to sail to tahiti and return with breadfruit bligh is most known for the mutiny of his crew which resulted in his being set adrift in 1789 he later became governor of new south wales where he was the subject of another mutinythe rum rebellion george vancouver one of cooks midshipmen led a voyage of exploration to the pacific coast of north america from 1791 to 1794 in honour of his former commander vancouvers ship was named discovery george dixon who sailed under cook on his third expedition later commanded his own henry roberts a lieutenant under cook spent many years after that voyage preparing the detailed charts that went into cooks posthumous atlas published around 1784 cooks contributions to knowledge were internationally recognised during his lifetime in 1779 while the american colonies were fighting britain for their independence benjamin franklin wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea recommending that if they came into contact with cooks vessel they were to not consider her an enemy nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her nor obstruct her immediate return to england by detaining her or sending her into any other part of europe or to america but that you treat the said captain cook and his people with all civility and kindness as common friends to mankind unknown to franklin cook had met his death a month before this safe conduct passport was written cooks voyages were involved in another unusual first the first recorded circumnavigation of the world by an animal was by cooks goat who made that memorable journey twice the first time on hms dolphin under samuel wallis and then aboard endeavour when they returned to england cook had the goat presented with a silver collar engraved with lines from samuel johnson perpetui ambita bis terra praemia lactis haec habet altrici capra secunda jovis in fame scarce second to the nurse of jove this goat who twice the world had traversed rounddeserving both her masters care and loveease and perpetual pasture now has found she was put to pasture on cooks farm outside london and was reportedly admitted to the privileges of the royal naval hospital at greenwich cooks journal recorded the date of the goats death 28 march 1772 memorials a us coin the 1928 hawaiian sesquicentennial half-dollar carries cooks image minted for the 150th anniversary of his discovery of the islands its low mintage 10008 has made this example of early united states commemorative coins both scarce and expensive the site where he was killed in hawaii was marked in 1874 by a white obelisk set on 25 square feet 23m of chained-off beach this land although in hawaii was deeded to the united kingdom a nearby town is named captain cook hawaii several hawaiian businesses also carry his name the apollo 15 commandservice module endeavour was named after cooks ship hmsendeavour as was the space shuttleendeavour another shuttle discovery was named after cooks hmsdiscovery the first institution of higher education in north queensland australia was named after him with james cook university opening in townsville in 1970 numerous institutions landmarks and place names reflect the importance of cooks contributions

the us state of alaska and the canadian yukon territory and is designated boundary peak 182 as one of the official boundary peaks of the hayherbert treaty a life-size statue of cook upon a column stands in hyde park located in the centre of sydney a large aquatic monument is planned for cooks landing place at botany bay sydney one of the earliest monuments to cook in the united kingdom is located at the vache erected in 1780 by admiral hugh palliser a contemporary of cook and one-time owner of the estate a huge obelisk was built in 1827 as a monument to cook on easby moor overlooking his boyhood village of great ayton along with a smaller monument at the former location of cooks cottage there is also a monument to cook in the church of st andrew the great st andrews street cambridge where his sons hugh a student at christs college and james were buried cooks widow elizabeth was also buried in the church and in her will left money for the memorials upkeep the 250th anniversary of cooks birth was marked at the site of his birthplace in marton by the opening of the captain cook birthplace museum located within stewart park 1978 a granite vase just to the south of the museum marks the approximate spot where he was born tributes also abound in post-industrial middlesbrough including a primary school shopping square and the bottle o notes a public artwork by claes oldenburg that was erected in the towns central gardens in 1993 also named after cook is the james cook university hospital a major teaching hospital which opened in 2003 with a railway station
