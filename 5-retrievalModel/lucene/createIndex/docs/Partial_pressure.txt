in a mixture of gases each constituent gas has a partial pressure which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature the total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture the partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gass molecules gases dissolve diffuse and react according to their partial pressures and not according to their concentrations in gas mixtures or liquids this general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology for example the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration and the amount that is toxic is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone this is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases but can also be measured in for example cerebrospinal fluid symbol the symbol for pressure is usually p or p which may use a subscript to identify the pressure and gas species are also referred to by subscript when combined these subscripts are applied recursively examples daltons law of partial pressures daltons law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture this equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas the molecules are so far apart that they do not interact with each other most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal for example given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen n2 hydrogen h2 and ammonia nh3 ideal gas mixtures ideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules that is the mole fraction x i displaystyle xmathrm i of an individual gas component in an ideal gas mixture can be expressed in terms of the components partial pressure or the moles of the component and the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression the mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture the ratio of partial pressures relies on the following isotherm relation vx is the partial volume of any individual gas component x vtot is the total volume of the gas mixture px is the partial pressure of gas x ptot is the total pressure of the gas mixture nx is the amount of substance of gas x ntot is the total amount of substance in gas mixture partial volume amagats law of additive volume the partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture it is useful in gas mixtures eg air to focus on one particular gas component eg oxygen it can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction vx is the partial volume of an individual gas component x in the mixture vtot is the total volume of the gas mixture px is the partial pressure of gas x ptot is the total pressure of the gas mixture nx is the amount of substance of gas x ntot is the total amount of substance in the gas mixture vapor pressure vapor pressure is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases ie liquid or solid most often the term is used to describe a liquids tendency to evaporate it is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid a liquids atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point the higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid the vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids as can be seen in the chart the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points for example at any given temperature methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart it also has the lowest normal boiling point -242c which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride the blue line intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere atm of absolute vapor pressure note that at higher altitudes the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level so boiling points of liquids are reduced at the top of mount everest the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0333 atm so by using the graph the boiling point of diethyl ether would be approximately 75c versus 346c at sea level 1 atm equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures it is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula for a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products such as the equilibrium constant of the reaction would be for reversible reactions changes in the total pressure temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with le chateliers principle however the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift in some cases the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider henrys law and the solubility of gases gases will dissolve in liquids to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid called the solvent the equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is the form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution this statement is known as henrys law and the equilibrium constant k displaystyle k is quite often referred to as the henrys law constant henrys law is sometimes written as where k displaystyle k is also referred to as the henrys law constant as can be seen by comparing equations 1 and 2 above k displaystyle k is the reciprocal of k displaystyle k since both may be referred to as the henrys law constant readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the henrys law equation is being used henrys law is an approximation that only applies for dilute ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not react chemically with the gas being dissolved in diving breathing gases in underwater diving the physiological effects of individual component gases of breathing gases is a function of partial pressure using diving terms partial pressure is calculated as for the component gas i for example at 50 metres 164ft underwater the total absolute pressure is 6bar 600kpa ie 1 bar of atmospheric pressure 5 bar of water pressure and the partial pressures of the main components of air oxygen 21 by volume and nitrogen approximately 79 by volume are the minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is 016 bars 16kpa absolute hypoxia and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 016 bar absolute oxygen toxicity involving convulsions becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high the noaa diving manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 16 bar absolute of 120 minutes at 15 bar absolute of 150 minutes at 14 bar absolute of 180 minutes at 13 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 12 bar absolute oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded the partial pressure of oxygen determines the maximum operating depth of a gas mixture narcosis is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure typically the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for technical diving may be around 45bar absolute based on an equivalent narcotic depth of 35 metres 115ft the effect of a toxic contaminant such as carbon monoxide in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed a mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive or a tolerable level of carbon dioxide in the breathing loop of a diving rebreather may be come intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver in medicine the partial pressures of particularly oxygen p o 2 displaystyle pmathrm o 2 and carbon dioxide p c o 2 displaystyle pmathrm co 2 are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases but can also be measured in for example cerebrospinal fluid see also science of underwater diving portal breathing gas gas used for human respiration henrys
