mediterranean sea italy shares open land borders with france switzerland austria slovenia and the enclaved microstates san marino and vatican city italy covers an area of 301340km 116350sqmi and has a largely temperate seasonal and mediterranean climate with around 61 million inhabitants it is the fourth-most populous eu member state and the most populous country in southern europe due to its central geographic location in europe and the mediterranean italy has historically been home to a myriad of peoples and cultures in addition to the various ancient italian tribes and italic peoples dispersed throughout the italian peninsula and insular italy beginning from the classical era phoenicians carthaginians and greeks established settlements in the south of italy with etruscans and celts inhabiting the centre and the north of italy respectively the italic tribe known as the latins formed the roman kingdom in the 8th century bc which eventually became a republic with a government of the senate and the people the roman republic conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the peninsula in some cases through the establishment of federations and the republic eventually expanded and conquered parts of europe north africa and the near east by the first century bc the roman empire emerged as the dominant power in the mediterranean basin and became the leading cultural political and religious centre of western civilisation inaugurating the pax romana a period of more than 200 years during which italys technology economy art and literature flourished italy remained the homeland of the romans and the metropole of the roman empire the legacy of the roman empire endured its fall and can be observed in the global distribution of culture law governments christianity and the latin script during the early middle ages italy endured sociopolitical collapse and barbarian invasions but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics mainly in the northern and central regions of italy rose to great prosperity through shipping commerce and banking laying the groundwork for modern capitalism these mostly independent statelets served as europes main trading hubs with asia and the near east often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout europe however part of central italy was under the control of the theocratic papal states while southern italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century partially as a result of a succession of byzantine arab norman angevin and aragonese conquests of the region the renaissance began in italy and spread to the rest of europe bringing a renewed interest in humanism science exploration and art italian culture flourished producing famous scholars artists and polymaths such as michelangelo leonardo da vinci raphael galileo and machiavelli during the middle ages italian explorers such as marco polo christopher columbus amerigo vespucci john cabot and giovanni da verrazzano discovered new routes to the far east and the new world helping to usher in the european age of discovery nevertheless italys commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the mediterranean centuries of infighting between the italian city-states such as the italian wars of the 15th and 16th centuries left the region fragmented and it was subsequently conquered and further divided by european powers such as france spain and austria by the mid-19th century rising italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval after centuries of foreign domination and political division italy was almost entirely unified in 1871 establishing the kingdom of italy as a great power from the late 19th century to the early 20th century italy rapidly industrialised namely in the north and acquired a colonial empire while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation fuelling a large and influential diaspora despite being one of the main victors in world war i italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil leading to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922 participation in world war ii on the axis side ended in military defeat economic destruction and the italian civil war following the liberation of italy and the rise of the resistance the country abolished the monarchy reinstated democracy enjoyed a prolonged economic boom and despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil eg the anni di piombo the maxi trial and mani pulite became a major advanced country today italy is considered to be one of the worlds most culturally and economically developed countries with its economy ranking eighth largest in the world and third in the eurozone as an advanced economy it has the sixth-largest worldwide national wealth and is ranked third for its central bank gold reserve italy has a very high level of human development and it stands among the top countries for life expectancy the country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic military cultural and diplomatic affairs and it is both a regional power and a great power italy is a founding and leading member of the european union and a member of numerous international institutions including the un nato the oecd the osce the wto the g7 the g20 the union for the mediterranean the council of europe uniting for consensus the schengen area and many more as a reflection of its cultural wealth italy is home to 54 world heritage sites the most in the world and is the fifth-most visited country etymology hypotheses for the etymology of the name italia are numerous one is that it was borrowed via greek from the oscan vteli land of calves cf lat vitulus calf umb vitlo calf the bull was a symbol of the southern italic tribes and was often depicted goring the roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free italy during the social war greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that italy was named after italus mentioned also by aristotle and thucydides the name italia originally applied only to a part of what is now southern italy according to antiochus of syracuse the southern portion of the bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern province of reggio and part of the provinces of catanzaro and vibo valentia but by his time oenotria and italy had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of lucania as well the greeks gradually came to apply the name italia to a larger region but the peninsula and its borders expanded over time according to strabos geographica before the expansion of the roman republic the name was used by greeks to indicate the land between the strait of messina and the line connecting the gulf of salerno and gulf of taranto corresponding roughly to the current region of calabria later the term was extended by romans to include the italian peninsula up to the rubicon a river located between northern and central italy in 49 bc with the lex roscia julius caesar gave roman citizenship to the people of the cisalpine gaul and then in 42 bce the hitherto existing province was abolished thus extending italy to the north up to the southern foot of the alps it was during the reign of emperor augustus that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the alps the islands of sardinia corsica sicily and malta were added to italy by diocletian in 292 ad history prehistory and antiquity thousands of palaeolithic-era artifacts have been recovered from monte poggiolo and dated to around 850000 years before the present making them the oldest evidence of first hominins habitation in the peninsula excavations throughout italy revealed a neanderthal presence dating back to the palaeolithic period some 200000 years ago while modern humans appeared about 40000 years ago archaeological sites from this period include addaura cave altamura ceprano and gravina in puglia the ancient peoples of pre-roman italy such as the umbrians the latins from which the romans emerged volsci oscans samnites sabines the celts the ligures and many others were indo-european peoples the main historic peoples of possible non-indo-european heritage include the etruscans the elymians and the sicani in sicily and the prehistoric sardinians who gave birth to the nuragic civilisation other ancient populations being of undetermined language families and of possible non-indo-european origin include the rhaetian people and cammuni known for their rock carvings in valcamonica the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world a well-preserved natural mummy known as tzi the iceman determined to be 5000 years old between 3400 and 3100 bce copper age was discovered in the similaun glacier of south tyrol in 1991 the first foreign colonizers were the phoenicians who initially established colonies and founded various emporiums on the coasts of sicily and sardinia some of these soon became small urban centers and were developed parallel to the greek colonies among the main centers there were the cities of motya zyz modern palermo soluntum in sicily and nora sulci and tharros in sardinia between the 17th and the 11th centuries bc mycenaean greeks established contacts with italy and in the 8th and 7th centuries bc a number of greek colonies were established all along the coast of sicily and the southern part of the italian peninsula that became known as magna graecia the greek colonization placed the italic peoples in contact with democratic government forms and with elevated artistic and cultural expressions ancient rome rome a settlement around a ford on the river tiber conventionally founded in 753 bc was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system initially with sovereigns of latin and sabine origin later by etruscan kings the tradition handed down seven kings romulus numa pompilius tullus hostilius ancus marcius tarquinius priscus servius tullius and tarquinius superbus in 509 bc the romans expelled the last king from their city favoring a government of the senate and the people spqr and establishing an oligarchic republic the italian peninsula named italia was consolidated into a single entity during the roman expansion and conquest of new lands at the expense of etruscans celts and greeks a permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities was formed and rome began the conquest of western europe northern africa and the near east in the wake of julius caesars rise and death in the first century bc rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from britain to the borders of persia and engulfing the whole mediterranean basin in which greek and roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation the long and triumphant reign of the first emperor augustus began a golden age of peace and prosperity italy remained the metropole of the empire and as the homeland of the romans and the territory of the capital maintained a special status which made it not a province but the domina ruler of the provinces more than two centuries of stability followed during which italy was referred to as the rectrix mundi queen of the world and omnium terrarum parens motherland of all lands the roman empire was among the most powerful economic cultural political and military forces in the world of its time and it was one of the largest empires in world history at its height under trajan it covered 5 million square kilometres the roman legacy has deeply influenced the western civilisation shaping most of the modern world among the many legacies of roman dominance are the widespread use of the romance languages derived from latin the numerical system the modern western alphabet and calendar and the emergence of christianity as a major world religion the indo-roman trade relations beginning around the 1st century bce testifies to extensive roman trade in far away regions many reminders of the commercial trade between the indian subcontinent and italy have been found such as the ivory statuette pompeii lakshmi from the ruins of pompeii in a slow decline since the third century ad the empire split in two in 395 ad the western empire under the pressure of the barbarian invasions eventually dissolved in 476 ad when its last emperor romulus augustulus was deposed by the germanic chief odoacer while the eastern half of the empire survived for another thousand years middle ages after the fall of the western roman empire italy fell under the power of odoacers kingdom and later was seized by the ostrogoths followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under byzantine emperor justinian the invasion of another germanic tribe the lombards late in the same century reduced the byzantine presence to the rump realm of the exarchate of ravenna and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1300 years invasions of the peninsula caused a chaotic succession of barbarian kingdoms and the so-called dark ages the lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the frankish empire by charlemagne in the late 8th century the franks also helped the formation of the papal states in central italy until the 13th century italian politics was dominated by the relations between the holy roman emperors and the papacy with most of the italian city-states siding with the former ghibellines or with the latter guelphs from momentary convenience the germanic emperor and the roman pontiff became the universal powers of medieval europe however the conflict for the investiture controversy a conflict over two radically different views of whether secular authorities such as kings counts or dukes had any legitimate role in appointments to ecclesiastical offices and the clash between guelphs and ghibellines led to the end of the imperial-feudal system in the north of italy where city-states gained independence it was during this chaotic era that italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution the medieval commune given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the empire and the holy see local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order the investiture controversy was finally resolved by the concordat of worms in 1176 a league of city-states the lombard league defeated the german emperor frederick barbarossa at the battle of legnano thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central italian cities in coastal and southern areas the maritime republics grew to eventually dominate the mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the orient they were independent thalassocratic city-states though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the byzantine empire all these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power although in practice these were oligarchical and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement the four most prominent maritime republics were venice genoa pisa and amalfi venice and genoa were europes gateway to trade with the east and a producer of fine glass while florence was a capital of silk wool banks and jewellery the wealth such business brought to italy meant that large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned the republics were heavily involved in the crusades providing support but most especially taking advantage of the political and trading opportunities resulting from these wars italy first felt huge economic changes in europe which led to the commercial revolution the republic of venice was able to defeat the byzantine empire and finance the voyages of marco polo to asia the first universities were formed in italian cities and scholars such as thomas aquinas obtained international fame frederick of sicily made italy the political-cultural centre of a reign that temporarily included the holy roman empire and the kingdom of jerusalem capitalism and banking families emerged in florence where dante and giotto were active around 1300 in the south sicily had become an islamic emirate in the 9th century thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine principalities of southern italy through a complex series of events southern italy developed as a unified kingdom first under the house of hohenstaufen then under the capetian house of anjou and from the 15th century the house of aragon in sardinia the former byzantine provinces became independent states known in italian as giudicati although some parts of the island became controlled by genoa or pisa until the aragonese annexation in the 15th century the black death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on italy by killing perhaps one third of the population however the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities trade and economy which allowed the bloom of humanism and renaissance that later spread to europe early modern in the 14th and 15th centuries northern-central italy was divided into a number of warring city-states the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger papal states and the kingdom of sicily referred to here as naples though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers as in the case of the duchy of milan which was officially a constituent state of the mainly germanic holy roman empire the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized italian lands following the collapse of the western roman empire the strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the signorie regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties war between the city-states was endemic and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri bands of soldiers drawn from around europe especially germany and switzerland led largely by italian captains decades of fighting eventually saw florence milan and venice emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the peace of lodi in 1454 which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries this peace would hold for the next forty years the renaissance a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture originated in italy due to a number of factors the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities the patronage of its dominant families and the migration of greek scholars and texts to italy following the conquest of constantinople at the hands of the ottoman turks the italian renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the italian wars the medici became the leading family of florence and fostered and inspired the birth of the italian renaissance along with other families of italy such as the visconti and sforza of milan the este of ferrara and the gonzaga of mantua artists like leonardo da vinci brunelleschi botticelli michelangelo giotto donatello titian and raphael produced inspired works their paintwork was more realistic-looking than had been created by medieval artists and their marble statues rivalled and sometimes surpassed those of classical antiquity humanist historian leonardo bruni divided the history in the antiquity middle ages and modern period the ideas and ideals of the renaissance soon spread into northern europe france england and much of europe in the meantime the discovery of the americas the new routes to asia discovered by the portuguese and the rise of the ottoman empire all factors which eroded the traditional italian dominance in trade with the east caused a long economic decline in the peninsula italian explorers and navigators from the dominant maritime republics played a key role in ushering the age of discovery and the european colonization of the americas the most notable among them were christopher columbus who led led the first european expeditions to the caribbean and central and south america and he is credited with discovering the new world and the opening of the americas for conquest and settlement by europeans john cabot the first european to explore parts of the north american continent in 1497 amerigo vespucci who first demonstrated in about 1502 that the new world was not asia as initially conjectured but a fourth continent previously unknown to people of the old world america is named after him and giovanni da verrazzano renowned as the first european to explore the atlantic coast of north america between florida and new brunswick in 1524 furthermore the papal states was involved in resolving disputes between competing colonial powers the only attempt by an italian state to colonise the americas was taken into consideration by ferdinando i de medici grand duke of tuscany who organised an expedition in 1608 under the command of robert thornton to northern brazil and the amazon river after ferdinandos death the following year nobody after him was interested in the establishment of an overseas colony however italian nobleman giovanni paolo lascaris grand master of the knights hospitaller of malta at that time part of sicily possessed some caribbean islands that were colonized from 1651 to 1665 following the italian wars 14941559 ignited by the rivalry between france and spain the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination first under spain 1559 to 1713 and then austria 1713 to 1796 in 16291631 a new outburst of plague claimed about 14 of italys population in addition as the spanish empire started to decline in the 17th century so did its possessions in naples sicily sardinia and milan in particular southern italy was impoverished and cut off from the mainstream of events in europe spains principal military base in europe was the duchy of milan which by its geographical position blocked french expansion into italy in the 18th century as a result of the war of spanish succession austria replaced spain as the dominant foreign power while the house of savoy emerged as a regional power expanding to piedmont and sardinia in the same century the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling lites during the napoleonic wars northern-central italy was invaded and reorganised as a new kingdom of italy a client state of the french empire while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by joachim murat napoleons brother-in-law who was crowned as king of naples the 1814 congress of vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century but the ideals of the french revolution could not be eradicated and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century italian unification the birth of the kingdom of italy was the result of efforts by italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the house of savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire italian peninsula following the congress of vienna in 1815 the political and social italian unification movement or risorgimento emerged to unite italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control a prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist giuseppe mazzini member of the secret revolutionary society carbonari and founder of the influential political movement young italy in the early 1830s who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement his prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active the most famous member of young italy was the revolutionary and general giuseppe garibaldi renowned for his extremely loyal followers who led the italian republican drive for unification in southern italy however the northern italy monarchy of the house of savoy in the kingdom of sardinia whose government was led by camillo benso count of cavour also had ambitions of establishing a united italian state in the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through europe an unsuccessful first war of independence was declared on austria the kingdom of sardinia again attacked the austrian empire in the second italian war of independence of 1859 with the aid of france resulting in liberating lombardy in 18601861 garibaldi led the drive for unification in naples and sicily the expedition of the thousand while the house of savoy troops occupied the central territories of the italian peninsula except rome and part of papal states teano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 october 1860 between giuseppe garibaldi and victor emmanuel ii last king of sardinia in which garibaldi shook victor emanuels hand and hailed him as king of italy thus garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of italian unity under a monarchy cavour agreed to include garibaldis southern italy allowing it to join the union with the kingdom of sardinia in 1860 this allowed the sardinian government to declare a united italian kingdom on 17 march 1861 victor emmanuel ii then became the first king of a united italy and the capital was moved from turin to florence in 1866 victor emmanuel ii allied with prussia during the austro-prussian war waging the third italian war of independence which allowed italy to annexe venetia finally in 1870 as france abandoned its garrisons in rome during the disastrous franco-prussian war to keep the large prussian army at bay the italians rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the papal states italian unification was completed and shortly afterward italys capital was moved to rome victor emmanuel garibaldi cavour and mazzini have been referred as italys four fathers of the fatherland monarchical period the new kingdom of italy obtained great power status the constitutional law of the kingdom of sardinia the albertine statute of 1848 was extended to the whole kingdom of italy in 1861 and provided for basic freedoms of the new state but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting the government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces as northern italy quickly industrialised the south and rural areas of the north remained underdeveloped and overpopulated forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential diaspora the italian socialist party constantly increased in strength challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment in 1913 male universal suffrage was adopted the pre-war period dominated by giovanni giolitti prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921 was characterized by the economic industrial and political-cultural modernization of italian society starting from the last two decades of the 19th century italy developed into a colonial power by forcing somalia eritrea and later libya and the dodecanese under its rule from 2 november 1899 to 7 september 1901 italy also participated as part of the eight-nation alliance forces during the boxer rebellion in china on 7 september 1901 a concession in tientsin was ceded to the country and on 7 june 1902 the concession was taken into italian possession and administered by a consul italy nominally allied with the german empire and the empire of austria-hungary in the triple alliance in 1915 joined the allies into world war i with a promise of substantial territorial gains that included western inner carniola former austrian littoral dalmatia as well as parts of the ottoman empire the country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the big four top allied powers the war was initially inconclusive as the italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the alps making little progress and suffering very heavy losses however the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called 99 boys ragazzi del 99 all males born in 1899 who were turning 18 led to more effective italian defensive victories in major battles such as on monte grappa and in a series of battles on the piave river eventually in october 1918 the italians launched a massive offensive culminating in the victory of vittorio veneto the italian victory marked the end of the war on the italian front secured the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the first world war less than two weeks later during the war more than 650000 italian soldiers and as many civilians died and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy under the peace treaties of saint-germain rapallo and rome italy gained a permanent seat in the league of nationss executive council and obtained most of the promised territories but not dalmatia except zara allowing nationalists to define the victory as mutilated moreover italy annexed the hungarian harbour of fiume that was not part of territories promised at london but had been occupied after the end of the war by gabriele dannunzio fascist regime the socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the great war inspired by the russian revolution led to counter-revolution and repression throughout italy the liberal establishment fearing a soviet-style revolution started to endorse the small national fascist party led by benito mussolini in october 1922 the blackshirts of the national fascist party attempted a coup named the march on rome which failed but at the last minute king victor emmanuel iii refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed mussolini prime minister over the next few years mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties thus forming a dictatorship these actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as nazi germany and francoist spain in 1935 mussolini invaded ethiopia and founded the italian east africa resulting in an international alienation and leading to italys withdrawal from the league of nations italy allied with nazi germany and the empire of japan and strongly supported francisco franco in the spanish civil war in 1939 italy annexed albania a de facto protectorate for decades italy entered world war ii on 10 june 1940 after initially advancing in british somaliland egypt the balkans and eastern fronts the italians were defeated in east africa soviet union and north africa the armistice of villa giusti which ended fighting between italy and austria-hungary at the end of world war i resulted in italian annexation of neighbouring parts of yugoslavia during the interwar period the fascist italian government undertook a campaign of italianisation in the areas it annexed which suppressed slavic language schools political parties and cultural institutions during world war ii italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing by deportation of about 25000 people mainly jews croats and slovenians to the italian concentration camps such as rab gonars monigo renicci di anghiari and elsewhere in italy and yugoslavia unlike in germany few war crimes were prosecuted yugoslav partisans perpetrated their own crimes during and after the war including the foibe killings meanwhile about 250000 italians and anti-communist slavs fled to italy in the istrian exodus an allied invasion of sicily began in july 1943 leading to the collapse of the fascist regime and the fall of mussolini on 25 july mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of king victor emmanuel iii in co-operation with the majority of the members of the grand council of fascism which passed a motion of no confidence on 8 september italy signed the armistice of cassibile ending its war with the allies the germans helped by the italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central italy the country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war as the allies were slowly moving up from the south in the north the germans set up the italian social republic rsi a nazi puppet state with mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by german paratroopers the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement the resistenza in late april 1945 with total defeat looming mussolini attempted to escape north but was captured and summarily executed near lake como by italian partisans his body was then taken to milan where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise hostilities ended on 29 april 1945 when the german forces in italy surrendered nearly half a million italians including civilians died in the conflict and the italian economy had been all but destroyed per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century republican italy italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 june 1946 a day celebrated since as republic day this was also the first time that italian women were entitled to vote victor emmanuel iiis son umberto ii was forced to abdicate and exiled the republican constitution was approved on 1 january 1948 under the treaty of peace with italy of 1947 most of julian march was lost to yugoslavia and later the free territory of trieste was divided between the two states italy also lost all of its colonial possessions formally ending the italian empire in 1950 italian somaliland was made a united nations trust territory under italian administration until 1 july 1960 fears in the italian electorate of a possible communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 april 1948 when the christian democrats under the leadership of alcide de gasperi obtained a landslide victory consequently in 1949 italy became a member of nato the marshall plan helped to revive the italian economy which until the late 1960s enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the economic miracle in 1957 italy was a founding member of the european economic community eec which became the european union eu in 1993 from the late 1960s until the early 1980s the country experienced the years of lead a period characterised by economic crisis especially after the 1973 oil crisis widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups with the alleged involvement of us and soviet intelligence the years of lead culminated in the assassination of the christian democrat leader aldo moro in 1978 and the bologna railway station massacre in 1980 where 85 people died in the 1980s for the first time since 1945 two governments were led by non-christian-democrat premiers one republican giovanni spadolini and one socialist bettino craxi the christian democrats remained however the main government party during craxis government the economy recovered and italy became the worlds fifth largest industrial nation after it gained the entry into the g7 group in 70s however as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era soon passing 100 of the countrys gdp italy faced several terror attacks between 199293 perpetrated by the sicilian mafia as a consequence of several life sentences pronounced during the maxi trial and of the new anti-mafia measures launched by the government in 1992 two major dynamite attacks killed the judges giovanni falcone 23 may in the capaci bombing and paolo borsellino 19 july in the via damelio bombing one year later mayjuly 1993 tourist spots were attacked such as the via dei georgofili in florence via palestro in milan and the piazza san giovanni in laterano and via san teodoro in rome leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the uffizi gallery the catholic church openly condemned the mafia and two churches were bombed and an anti-mafia priest shot dead in rome also in the early 1990s italy faced significant challenges as voters disenchanted with political paralysis massive public debt and the extensive corruption system known as tangentopoli uncovered by the clean hands investigation demanded radical reforms the scandals involved all major parties but especially those in the government coalition the christian democrats who ruled for almost 50 years underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded splitting up into several factions the communists reorganised as a social-democratic force during the 1990s and the 2000s centre-right dominated by media magnate silvio berlusconi and centre-left coalitions led by university professor romano prodi alternately governed the country in the late 2000s italy was severely hit by the great recession from 2008 to 2013 the country suffered 42 months of gdp recession the economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced berlusconi to resign in 2011 the government of the conservative prime minister was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of mario monti following the 2013 general election the vice-secretary of the democratic party enrico letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left grand coalition in 2014 challenged by the new secretary of the pd matteo renzi letta resigned and was replaced by renzi the new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the senate and a new electoral law on 4 december the constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum and renzi resigned after few days on 12 december the foreign affairs minister paolo gentiloni was appointed new prime minister italy was affected by the european migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the eu since 2013 the country took in over 700000 migrants and refugees mainly from sub-saharan africa which caused great strain on the public purse and a surge in the support for far-right euroskeptic or eurocritical political parties which ended in the 2018 general election the election was characterized by a strong showing of the five star movement and the league and the university professor giuseppe conte became the prime minister at the head of a populist coalition geography italy is located in southern europe between latitudes 35 and 47 n and longitudes 6 and 19 e to the north italy

northern boundary where italys highest point is located on monte bianco 4810m or 15780ft the po italys longest river 652 kilometres or 405 miles flows from the alps on the western border with france and crosses the padan plain on its way to the adriatic sea the five largest lakes are in order of diminishing size garda 36794km or 142sqmi maggiore 21251km or 82sqmi whose minor northern part is switzerland como 1459km or 56sqmi trasimeno 12429km or 48sqmi and bolsena 11355km or 44sqmi although the country includes the italian peninsula adjacent islands and most of the southern alpine basin some of italys territory extends beyond the alpine basin and some islands are located outside the eurasian continental shelf these territories are the comuni of livigno sexten innichen toblach in part chiusaforte tarvisio graun im vinschgau in part which are all part of the danubes drainage basin while the val di lei constitutes part of the rhines basin and the islands of lampedusa and lampione are on the african continental shelf waters four different seas surround the italian peninsula in the mediterranean sea from three sides the adriatic sea in the east the ionian sea in the south and the ligurian sea and the tyrrhenian sea in the west most of rivers of italy drain either into the adriatic sea such as the po piave adige brenta tagliamento and reno or into the tyrrhenian like the arno tiber and volturno the waters from some border municipalities livigno in lombardy innichen and sexten in trentino-alto adigesdtirol drain into the black sea through the basin of the drava a tributary of the danube and the waters from the lago di lei in lombardy drain into the north sea through the basin of the rhine in the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes the largest of which is garda 370km or 143sqmi other well known of these subalpine lakes are lake maggiore 2125km or 82sqmi whose most northerly section is part of switzerland como 146km or 56sqmi one of the deepest lakes in europe orta lugano iseo and idro other notable lakes in the italian peninsula are trasimeno bolsena bracciano vico varano and lesina in gargano and omodeo in sardinia volcanology the country is situated at the meeting point of the eurasian plate and the african plate leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity there are 14 volcanoes in italy four of which are active etna the traditional site of vulcans smithy stromboli vulcano and vesuvius the latter one is the only active volcano in mainland europe and is most famous for the destruction of pompeii and herculanum in the eruption in 79 ad several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity and there is still a large active caldera the campi flegrei north-west of naples the high volcanic and magmatic neogenic activity is subdivided into provinces magmatic tuscan monti cimini tolfa and amiata magmatic latium monti volsini vico nel lazio colli albani roccamonfina ultra-alkaline umbrian

sicily graham island etna and mount vulture until the 1950s italy was the first and only country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity in the larderello area and later in the mount amiata area the high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in lazio and tuscany as well as in most volcanic islands environment after its quick industrial growth italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems after several improvements it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability national parks cover about 5 of the country in the last decade italy has become one of the worlds leading producers of renewable energy ranking as the worlds fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010 renewable energies now make up about 12 of the total primary and final energy consumption in italy with a future target share set at 17 for the year 2020 however air pollution remains a severe problem especially in the industrialised north reaching the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer extensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity while because of rising water levels venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas as in the case of the seveso disaster the country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but after the chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008 planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with french technology this was in turn struck down by a referendum following the fukushima nuclear accident deforestation illegal building developments and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion all over italys mountainous regions leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 vajont dam flood the 1998 sarno and 2009 messina mudslides biodiversity italy has the highest level of faunal biodiversity in europe with over 57000 species recorded representing more than a third of all european fauna the italian peninsula is in the centre of the mediterranean sea forming a corridor between central europe and north africa and has 8000km 5000mi of coastline italy also receives species from the balkans eurasia the middle east italys varied geological structure including the alps and the apennines central italian woodlands and southern italian garigue and maquis shrubland also contribute to high climate and habitat diversity italian fauna includes 4777 endemic animal species such as the sardinian long-eared bat sardinian red deer spectacled salamander brown cave salamander italian cave salamander monte albo cave salamander sardinian brook newt italian newt italian frog apennine yellow-bellied toad aeolian wall lizard sicilian wall lizard italian aesculapian snake and sicilian pond turtle there are 102 mammals species in italy such as the alpine marmot etruscan shrew the smallest mammal in the world and european snow vole notable large mammals are the italian wolf marsican brown bear pyrenean chamois alpine ibex rough-toothed dolphin crested porcupine and mediterranean monk seal italy has also recorded 516 bird species and 56213 invertebrates species the flora was traditionally estimated to comprise about 5500 vascular plant species however as of 2005 6759 species are recorded in the data bank of italian vascular flora geobotanically the italian flora is shared between the circumboreal region and mediterranean region italy is a signatory to the berne convention on the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats and the habitats directive both affording protection to the italian fauna and flora climate because of the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation the climate of italy is highly diverse in most of the inland northern and central regions the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic in particular the climate of the po valley geographical region is mostly continental with harsh winters and hot summers the coastal areas of liguria tuscany and most of the south generally fit the mediterranean climate stereotype kppen climate classification csa conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interiors higher ground and valleys particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold wet and often snowy the coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer average winter temperatures vary from 0c 32f on the alps to 12c 54f in sicily like so the average summer temperatures range from 20c 68f to over 25c 77f winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder sunnier conditions in the south summers can be hot and humid across the country particularly in the south while northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn politics italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 june 1946 when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum the president of italy presidente della repubblica currently sergio mattarella since 2015 is italys head of state the president is elected for a single seven years mandate by the parliament of italy and some regional voters in joint session italy has a written democratic constitution resulting from the work of a constituent assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of nazi and fascist forces during the civil war government italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system the parliament is perfectly bicameral the two houses the chamber of deputies that meets in palazzo montecitorio and the senate of the republic that meets in palazzo madama have the same powers the prime minister officially president of the council of ministers presidente del consiglio dei ministri is italys head of government the prime minister and the cabinet are appointed by the president of the republic of italy and must pass a vote of confidence in parliament to come into office to remain the prime minister has to pass also eventual further votes of confindence or no confidence in parliament the prime minister is the president of the council of ministers which holds effective executive power and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities the office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems but the leader of the italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the parliament of italy another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the president of the council of ministers by virtue of that the prime minister has exclusive power to co-ordinate intelligence policies determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security apply and protect state secrets authorise agents to carry out operations in italy or abroad in violation of the law a peculiarity of the italian parliament is the representation given to italian citizens permanently living abroad 12 deputies and 6 senators elected in four distinct overseas constituencies in addition the italian senate is characterised also by a small number of senators for life appointed by the president for outstanding patriotic merits in the social scientific artistic or literary field former presidents of the republic are ex officio life senators italys three major political parties are the five star movement the democratic party and the lega during the 2018 general election these three parties won 614 out of 630 seats available in the chamber of deputies and 309 out of 315 in the senate berlusconis forza italia which formed a centre-right coalition with matteo salvinis northern league and giorgia melonis brothers of italy won most of the seats without getting the majority in parliament the rest of the seats were taken by five star movement matteo renzis democratic party along with achammer and panizzas south tyrolean peoples party trentino tyrolean autonomist party in a centre-left coalition and the independent free and equal party law and criminal justice the italian judicial system is based on roman law modified by the napoleonic code and later statutes the supreme court of cassation is the highest court in italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases the constitutional court of italy corte costituzionale rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a postworld war ii innovation since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in southern italy the most notorious of which being the sicilian mafia which would later expand into some foreign countries including the united states mafia receipts may reach 9 of italys gdp a 2009 report identified 610 comuni which have a strong mafia presence where 13 million italians live and 146 of the italian gdp is produced the calabrian ndrangheta nowadays probably the most powerful crime syndicate of italy accounts alone for 3 of the countrys gdp however at 0013 per 1000 people italy has only the 47th highest murder rate compared to 61 countries and the 43rd highest number of rapes per 1000 people compared to 64 countries in the

country is well known for its creative and innovative business a large and competitive agricultural sector with the worlds largest wine production and for its influential and high-quality automobile machinery food design and fashion industry italy is the worlds sixth largest manufacturing country characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and a large number of dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises notoriously clustered in several industrial districts which are the backbone of the italian industry this has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from china and other emerging asian economies based on lower labour costs with higher quality products italy was the worlds 7th largest exporter in 2016 its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the european union with whom it conducts about 59 of its total trade its largest eu trade partners in order of market share are germany 129 france 114 and spain 74 the automotive

million citizens its monetary policy is set by the european central bank italy has been hit hard by the financial crisis of 200708 that exacerbated the countrys structural problems effectively after a strong gdp growth of 56 per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s the political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt that stood at over 1318 of gdp in 2017 ranking second in the eu only after the greek one for all that the largest chunk of italian public debt is owned by national subjects a major difference between italy and greece and the level of household debt is much lower than the oecd average a gaping northsouth divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness it can be noted by the huge difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions and municipalities the richest province alto adige-south tyrol

about 80 of its energy requirements italy does not invest enough to maintain its drinking water supply the galli law passed in 1993 aimed at raising the level of investment and to improve service quality by consolidating service providers making them more efficient and increasing the level of cost recovery through tariff revenues despite these reforms investment levels have declined and remain far from sufficient science and technology through the centuries italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences during the renaissance italian polymaths such as leonardo da vinci 14521519 michelangelo 14751564 and leon battista alberti 14041472 made important contributions to a variety of fields including biology architecture and engineering galileo galilei 15641642 a physicist mathematician and astronomer played a major role in the scientific revolution his achievements include key improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and ultimately the triumph of copernicanism over the ptolemaic model other astronomers suchs as giovanni domenico cassini 16251712 and giovanni

coloseum and roman forum pompeii uffizi gallery galleria dellaccademia castel santangelo boboli garden venaria reale turin egyptian museum the borghese gallery the royal palace of caserta cenacolo vinciano museum villa deste pitti palace the excavations of hercolaneum naples national archaeological museum the medici chapels ostia antica excavations and museum blu grotto venice national archaeological museum lake como and pinacoteca di brera demographics at the end of 2013 italy had 60782668 inhabitants the resulting population density at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre 520sqmi is higher than that of most western european countries however the distribution of the population is widely uneven the most densely populated areas are the po valley that accounts for almost a half of the national population and the metropolitan areas of rome and naples while vast regions such as the alps and apennines highlands the plateaus of basilicata and the island of sardinia are very sparsely populated the population of italy almost doubled during the 20th century but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural south to the industrial cities of the north a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the italian economic miracle of the 19501960s high fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s after which they started to decline the population rapidly aged at the end of the 2000s decade one in five italians was over 65 years old however in recent years italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates the total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 118 children per woman in 1995 to 141 in 2008 the tfr is expected to reach 1618 in 2030 from the late 19th century until the 1960s italy was a country of mass emigration between 1898 and 1914 the peak years of italian diaspora approximately 750000 italians emigrated each year the diaspora concerned more than 25 million italians and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times as a result today more than 41 million italian citizens are living abroad while at least 60 million people of full or part italian ancestry live outside of italy most notably in argentina brazil uruguay venezuela the united states canada australia and france metropolitan cities and larger urban zone source immigration in 2016 italy had about 505 million foreign residents making up 83 of the total population the figures include more than half a million children born in italy to foreign nationals second generation immigrants but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired italian citizenship in 2016 about 201000 people acquired italian citizenship 130000 in 2014 the official figures also exclude illegal immigrants that were estimated in 2008 to number at least 670000 starting from the early 1980s until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants after the fall of the berlin wall and more recently the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the european union large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of eastern europe especially romania albania ukraine and poland an equally important source of immigration is neighbouring north africa in particular morocco egypt and tunisia with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the arab spring furthermore in recent years growing migration fluxes from asia-pacific notably china and the philippines and latin america have been recorded currently about one million romanian citizens around 10 of them being from the romani people ethnic group are officially registered as living in italy representing thus the most important individual country of origin followed by albanians and moroccans with about 500000 people each the number of unregistered romanians is difficult to estimate but the balkan investigative reporting network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more overall at the end of the 2000s decade the foreign born population of italy was from europe 54 africa 22 asia 16 the americas 8 and oceania 006 the distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in italy 87 of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country the most economically developed areas while only 13 live in the southern half of the peninsula languages the official language is italian there are an estimated 64 million native italian speakers and another 21 million who use it as a second language italian is often natively spoken in a regional variety not to be confused with italys regional and minority languages however the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s due to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television the state broadcaster rai helped set a standard italian twelve historical minority languages are formally recognised albanian catalan german greek slovene croatian french franco-provenal friulian ladin occitan and sardinian four of these enjoy a co-official status in their respective region french in the aosta valley german in south tyrol and ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring trentino and slovene in the province of trieste gorizia and udine a number of other ethnologue iso and unesco languages are not recognised by italian law like france italy has signed the european charter for regional or minority languages but has not ratified it because of recent immigration italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not italian nor a regional language according to the italian national institute of statistics romanian is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in italy almost 800000 people speak romanian as their first language 219 of the foreign residents aged 6 and over other prevalent mother tongues are arabic spoken by over 475000 people 131 of foreign residents albanian 380000 people and spanish 255000 people

pseudo-perspective and pure landscape panel painting becomes more common during the romanesque period under the heavy influence of byzantine icons towards the middle of the 13th century medieval art and gothic painting became more realistic with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in italy with cimabue and then his pupil giotto from giotto on the treatment of

theatre of ancient rome was a thriving and diverse art form ranging from festival performances of street theatre nude dancing and acrobatics to the staging of plautuss broadly appealing situation comedies to the high-style verbally elaborate tragedies of seneca although rome had a native tradition of performance the hellenization of roman culture in the 3rd century bce had a profound and energising effect on roman theatre and encouraged the development of latin literature of the highest quality for the stage as with many other literary genres roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the greek for example senecas phaedra was based on that of euripides and many of the comedies of plautus were direct translations of works by menander during the 16th century and on into the 18th century commedia dellarte was a form of improvisational theatre and it is still performed today travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of juggling acrobatics and more typically humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline called canovaccio plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called lazzi which were loose frameworks that provided the situations complications and outcome of the action around which the actors would improvise the characters of the commedia
