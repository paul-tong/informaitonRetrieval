the loasa expedition was a 16th-century voyage of discovery to the pacific ocean commanded by garcia jofre de loasa 1490 20 july 1526 and ordered by king charles i of spain to colonize the spice islands in the east indies the seven-ship fleet sailed from la corua spain in july 1525 and became the second naval expedition to cross the pacific ocean in history after magellan-elcanos voyage the expedition resulted in the discovery of the sea of hoces south of cape horn and the marshall islands in the pacific one ship ultimately arrived in the spice islands on new years day of 1527 origins de loasas expedition was conceived both as a rescue mission and a voyage of discovery the victoria a vessel from magellans expedition to the pacific had returned to spain with word that her sister ship the trinidad had last been seen attempting to return home by sailing east from the spice islands to south america de loasa was ordered to seek trinidad or news of her fate by voyaging along her expected return route to spain failing this he was to locate and colonise magellans spice islands and also to bring back news of the semi-mythical land of ophir which spanish scholars believed may be somewhere near china most possibly the philippines- for this purpose de loasa was assigned seven vessels and a total of 450 men including tradesmen and administrators for the spice islands settlement atlantic voyage the expedition set sail from corunna on july 24 1525 it consisted of seven ships santa mara de la victoria sancti spiritus anunciada san gabriel santa mara del parral and san lesmes and a patache santiago de loasa was named captain along with juan sebastin elcano who had reached the spice islands in 1521 during the magellan expedition the fleet headed southwest to the canary islands and then south along the african coastline in november 1525 de loasa moved west across the atlantic to brazil reaching the patagonian shore in january 1526 there was no sign of trinidad and de loasa decided to abandon the search for her and continue instead to the spice islands however the weather was poor and over the next several weeks in high winds while trying to enter the strait of magellan the ships alternately gathered and dispersed two ships sancti spiritus and anunciada were wrecked and one san gabriel tacked into the atlantic and deserted the expedition the san lesmes under the captaincy of francisco de hoces was driven south along the coast possibly to a latitude of 57 where the crew noted an end of land which may have been the first european sighting of cape horn after some difficulty hoces was able to steer his galleon northward once more rejoining the other three vessels that remained with the expedition on 26 may 1526 this diminished fleet of four ships three galleons and the patache passed through the strait and entered the pacific pacific voyage the bad weather which had originally scattered de loasa s fleet continued in the pacific the four remaining vessels quickly lost sight of each other in the heavy rain and were unable to regroup when the storm finally passed on 1 june the santiago sailed for north and in a 10000-kilometre voyage reached the pacific coast of mexico in july 1526 achieving the first navigation from europe to the western coast of north america san lesmes disappeared entirely twentieth century speculation suggests she may have run aground in the marquesas islands either on the island of anaa where a 1774 expedition found a cross erected on the beach or off the amanu atoll where an old spanish cannon was later found the third ship santa mara del parral sailed the pacific to sangir off the northern coast of sulawesi where the ship was beached and its crew were variously killed or enslaved by the natives four survivors were rescued in 1528 by another spanish expedition coming from mexico the last galleon santa maria de la victoria was the only ship to reach the spice islands landing in september 1526 survivors loasa himself died of scurvy on july 30 1526 elcano a few days later and alonso de salazar three weeks after that yigez reached the islands of visayas and mindanao in the philippines and the moluccas but died of food poisoning only andrs de urdaneta and 24 other men survived to land in the spice islands they returned to spain in 1536 in the portuguese india armada and under portuguese guard to
