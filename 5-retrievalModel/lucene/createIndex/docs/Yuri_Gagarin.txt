prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance he also underwent training for the upcoming flight the eventual choices for the first launch were gagarin and gherman titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics space was limited in the small vostok cockpit and both men were short gagarin was 157 metres 5ft 2in tall in august 1960 when gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates a soviet air force doctor evaluated his personality as follows modest embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy high degree of intellectual development evident in yuriy fantastic memory distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings a well-developed imagination quick reactions persevering prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends gagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers when the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly all but three chose gagarin one of these candidates yevgeny khrunov believed that gagarin was very focused and was demanding of himself and others when necessary gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life and was a keen sportsman cosmonaut valery bykovsky wrote service in the air force made us strong both physically and morally all of us cosmonauts took up sports and pt seriously when we served in the air force i know that yuri gagarin was fond of ice hockey he liked to play goal keeper i dont think i am wrong when i say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts in addition to being a keen ice hockey player gagarin was also a basketball fan and coached the saratov industrial technical school team as well as being a referee vostok 1 on 12 april 1961 the vostok 3ka-3 vostok 1 spacecraft

cedar the radio communication between the launch control room and gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch korolev preliminary stage intermediate main lift off we wish you a good flight everything is all right gagarin poyekhalilets go gagarins informal poyekhali became a historical phrase in the eastern bloc used to refer to the beginning of the space age in human history in his post-flight report gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight having been the first human in space the feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with earth conditions here you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps you feel as if you are suspended following the flight gagarin told the soviet leader nikita khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune the motherland hears the motherland knows russian the first two lines of the song are the motherland hears the motherland knowswhere her son flies in the sky this patriotic song was written by dmitri shostakovich in 1951 opus 86 with words by yevgeniy dolmatovsky some sources have claimed that gagarin commented during the flight i dont see any god up here however no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with earth-based stations during the spaceflight in a 2006 interview gagarins friend colonel valentin petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words and that the quote originated from nikita khrushchevs speech at the plenum of the central committee of the cpsu about the states anti-religion campaign saying gagarin flew into space but didnt see any god there petrov also said that gagarin had been baptised into the orthodox church as a child and a 2011 foma magazine article quoted the rector of the orthodox church in star city saying gagarin baptized his elder daughter yelena shortly before his space flight and his family used to celebrate christmas and easter and keep icons in the house after the soviet space program gagarins flight was a triumph for the soviet space program the announcement on the soviet radio was made by yuri levitan the same speaker who announced all major events in the great patriotic war gagarin became a national hero of the soviet union and eastern bloc and a worldwide celebrity newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight moscow and other cities in the soviet union held mass demonstrations the scale of which was second only to world war ii victory parades gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of moscow to the kremlin where in a lavish ceremony he was awarded the title of hero of the soviet union by nikita khrushchev later on gagarin toured widely abroad he visited italy germany canada brazil japan egypt and finland to promote the soviet unions accomplishment of putting the first human in space he visited the united kingdom three months after the vostok 1 mission going to london and manchester the sudden rise to fame took its toll on gagarin while acquaintances say gagarin had been a sensible drinker his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman a nurse named anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day at a black sea resort in september 1961 he attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow in 1962 he began serving as a deputy to the soviet of the union and was elected to the central committee of the young communist league he later returned to star city the cosmonaut facility where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft he became a lieutenant colonel of the soviet air forces on 12 june 1962 and received the rank of colonel on 6 november 1963 soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights being worried of losing their hero in an accident gagarin was backup pilot for his friend vladimir komarov in the soyuz 1 flight which was launched despite gagarins protests that additional safety precautions were necessary when komarovs flight ended in a fatal crash gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights on 20 december 1963 gagarin had become deputy training director of the star city cosmonaut training base two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the sssu but this time to the soviet of nationalities the following year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot on 17 february 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration passing with flying colors death on 27 march 1968 while on a routine training flight from chkalovsky air base he and flight instructor vladimir seryogin died in a mig-15uti crash near the town of kirzhach the bodies of gagarin and seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the kremlin on red square gagarin was survived by his wife valentina a graduate of the orenburg medical school and two daughters yelena born 1959 and galina born 1961 cause of jet crash the cause of the crash that killed gagarin is not entirely certain and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades soviet documents declassified in march 2003 showed that the kgb had conducted their own investigation of the accident in addition to one government and two military investigations the kgbs report dismissed various conspiracy theories instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash the report states that an air traffic controller provided gagarin with outdated weather information and that by the time of his flight conditions had deteriorated significantly ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft gagarins planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks the investigation concluded that gagarins aircraft entered a spin either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft because of the out-of-date weather report the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was and could not react properly to bring the mig-15 out of its spin another theory advanced in 2005 by the original crash investigator hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft a similar theory published in air space magazine is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude this dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash on 12 april 2007 the kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of gagarin government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation in april 2011 documents from a 1968 commission set up by the central committee of the communist party to investigate the accident were declassified those documents revealed that the commissions original conclusion was that gagarin or seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon or to avoid entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover leading the jet into a super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions in his 2004 book two sides of the moon alexey leonov who was part of a state commission established to investigate the death in 1968 recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard two loud booms in the distance corroborating other theories his conclusion is that a sukhoi jet which he identifies as a su-15 flagon was flying below its minimum allowed altitude and without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions he passed within 10 or 20 meters of yuri and seregins plane while breaking the sound barrier the resulting turbulence would have sent the mig into an uncontrolled spin leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier and the second was gagarins plane crashing in a june 2013 interview with russian television network rt leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second unauthorized su-15 flying in the area leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres 1480ft and that while running afterburners the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 1015 meters in the clouds passing close to gagarin turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin a deep spiral to be precise at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour as a condition of being allowed to discuss the report however leonov was required to not disclose the name of the su-15 pilot who was reported to be 80 years old as of 2013 and in poor health personal life in 1957 while at the first chkalov air force pilots school in orenburg gagarin met valentina ivanovna goryacheva a medical technician graduate of the orenburg medical school they were married on 7 november 1957 the same day gagarin graduated from orenburg and they have two daughters yelena yurievna gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the director-general of the moscow kremlin museums since 2001 galina yurievna gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at plekhanov russian university of economics in moscow

the frequent tours he did in the months after the vostok 1 mission success gagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure when he visited manchester in the united kingdom it was pouring rain however gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him gagarin stated if all these people have turned out to welcome me and can
