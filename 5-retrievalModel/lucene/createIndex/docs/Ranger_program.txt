the ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the united states in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the moon the ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface transmitting those images to earth until the spacecraft were destroyed upon impact a series of mishaps however led to the failure of the first six flights at one point the program was called shoot and hope congress launched an investigation into problems of management at nasa headquarters and jet propulsion laboratory after two reorganizations of the agencies ranger 7 successfully returned images in july 1964 followed by two more successful missions ranger was originally designed beginning in 1959 in three distinct phases called blocks each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design the jpl mission designers planned multiple launches in each block to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value of the mission and to assure at least one successful flight total research development launch and support costs for the ranger series of spacecraft rangers 1 through 9 was approximately 170 million equivalent to 101billion in 2016 ranger spacecraft each of the block iii ranger spacecraft had six cameras on board the cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times fields of view lenses and scan rates the camera system was divided into two channels p partial and f full each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies timers and transmitters the f-channel had two cameras the wide-angle a-camera and the narrow angle b-camera the p-channel had four cameras p1 and p2 narrow angle and p3 and p4 wide angle the final f-channel image was taken between 25 and 5 seconds before impact altitude about 5km and the last p-channel image 02 to 04 seconds before impact altitude about 600 m the images provided better resolution than was available from earth-based views by a factor of 1000 the design and construction of the cameras was led by leonard r malling the ranger program manager for the first six spacecraft was james d burke mission list block 1 missions ranger 1 launched 23 august 1961 lunar prototype launch failure ranger 2 launched 18 november 1961 lunar prototype launch failure block 1 consisting of two spacecraft launched into earth orbit in 1961 was intended to test the atlas-agena launch vehicle and spacecraft equipment without attempting to reach the moon problems with the early version of the launch vehicle left ranger 1 and ranger 2 in short-lived low-earth orbits in which the spacecraft could not stabilize themselves collect solar power or survive for long in 1962 jpl utilized the ranger 1 and ranger 2 design for the failed mariner 1 and successful mariner 2 deep-space probes to venus block 2 missions ranger 3 launched 26 january 1962 lunar probe spacecraft failed missed moon ranger 4 launched 23 april 1962 lunar probe spacecraft failed impact ranger 5 launched 18 october 1962 lunar probe spacecraft failed missed block 2 of the ranger project launched three spacecraft to the moon in 1962 carrying a tv camera a radiation detector and a seismometer in a separate capsule slowed by a rocket motor and packaged to survive its low-speed impact on the moons surface the three missions together demonstrated good performance of the atlasagena b launch vehicle and the adequacy of the spacecraft design but unfortunately not both on the same attempt ranger 3 had problems with both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft missed the moon by about 36800km and has orbited the sun ever since ranger 4 had a perfect launch but the spacecraft was completely disabled the project team tracked the seismometer capsule to impact just out of sight on the lunar far side validating the communications and navigation system ranger 5 missed the moon and was disabled no significant science information was gleaned from these missions the craft weighed 331kg around the end of block 2 it was discovered that a type of diode used in previous missions produced problematic gold-plate flaking in the conditions of space this may have been responsible for some of the failures block 3 missions ranger 6 launched 30 january 1964 lunar probe impact cameras failed ranger 7 launched 28 july 1964 impacted moon 31 july 1964 at 132549 ut 1021s 2035w 1035s 2058w -1035 -2058 ranger 7 -
