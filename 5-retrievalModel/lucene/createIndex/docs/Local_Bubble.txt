the local bubble or local cavity is a relative cavity in the interstellar medium ism of the orion arm in the milky way it contains among others the local interstellar cloud which contains the solar system and the g-cloud it is at least 300 light years across and is defined by its neutral-hydrogen density of about 005 atomscm or approximately one tenth of the average for the ism in the milky way 05 atomscm and one sixth that of the local interstellar cloud 03 atomscm the exceptionally sparse matter namely gas of the local bubble is the result of supernovae that exploded within the past ten to twenty million years and remains in an excited state emitting in the x-ray band it was once thought that the most likely candidate for the remains of this supernova was geminga a pulsar in the constellation gemini later however it has been suggested that multiple supernovae in subgroup b1 of the pleiades moving group were more likely responsible becoming a remnant supershell description the solar system has been traveling through the region currently occupied by the local bubble for the last five to ten million years its current location lies in the local interstellar cloud lic a minor region of denser material within the bubble the lic formed where the local bubble and the loop i bubble met the gas within the lic has a density of approximately 03 atoms per cubic centimeter the local bubble is not spherical but seems to be narrower in the galactic plane becoming somewhat egg-shaped or elliptical and may widen above and below the galactic plane becoming shaped like an hourglass it abuts other bubbles of less dense interstellar medium ism including in particular the loop i bubble the loop i bubble was cleared heated and maintained by supernovae and stellar winds in the scorpiuscentaurus association some 500 light years from the sun the loop i bubble contains the star antares also known as alpha scorpii as shown on the diagram above right several tunnels connect the cavities of the local bubble with the loop i bubble called the lupus tunnel other bubbles which are adjacent to the local bubble are the loop ii bubble and the loop iii bubble observation launched in february 2003 and active until april 2008 a small space observatory called cosmic hot interstellar plasma spectrometer chips or chipsat examined the hot gas within the local bubble the local bubble was also the region of interest for the extreme ultraviolet explorer mission 19922001 which examined hot euv sources within the bubble sources beyond the edge of the bubble were identified but attenuated by the denser interstellar medium see also gould belt list of nearest stars and brown dwarfs orioneridanus superbubble perseus arm superbubble anderson mark 6 january 2007 dont stop till you get to the fluff new scientist 193 2585 2630 doi101016s0262-40790760043-8 lallement r welsh b y vergely j l crifo f sfeir d december 1 2003 3d mapping of the dense interstellar gas around the local bubble astronomy astrophysics 411 3 447464 bibcode2003aa411447l doi1010510004-636120031214 near-earth supernovas sciencenasa headline news nasa january 6 2003 a breeze from the stars sciencenasa headline news nasa december 17 2004 a 3d map of the milky way galaxy and the orion arm astronomy portal space portal
