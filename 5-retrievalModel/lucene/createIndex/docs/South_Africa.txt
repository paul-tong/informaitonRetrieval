south africa officially the republic of south africa rsa is the southernmost country in africa it is bounded to the south by 2798 kilometres 1739mi of coastline of southern africa stretching along the south atlantic and indian oceans to the north by the neighbouring countries of namibia botswana and zimbabwe and to the east and northeast by mozambique and eswatini swaziland and it surrounds the enclaved country of lesotho south africa is the largest country in southern africa and the 25th-largest country in the world by land area and with over 57 million people is the worlds 24th-most populous nation it is the southernmost country on the mainland of the old world or the eastern hemisphere about 80 percent of south africans are of sub-saharan african ancestry divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different african languages nine of which have official status the remaining population consists of africas largest communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of 11 official languages which is the fourth highest number in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup dtat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until 1994 during the 20th century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed apartheid in 1948 institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress anc and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country the repeal of discriminatory laws began in 1990 since 1994 all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the countrys liberal democracy which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces south africa is often referred to as the rainbow nation to describe the countrys multicultural diversity especially in the wake of apartheid the world bank classifies south africa as an upper-middle-income economy and a newly industrialised country its economy is the second-largest in africa and the 34th-largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity south africa has the seventh-highest per capita income in africa however poverty and inequality remain widespread with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than us125 a day nevertheless south africa has been identified as a middle power in international affairs and maintains significant regional influence name the name south africa is derived from the countrys geographic location at the southern tip of africa upon formation the country was named the union of south africa in english reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate british colonies since 1961 the long form name in english has been the republic of south africa in dutch the country was named republiek van zuid-afrika replaced in 1983 by the afrikaans republiek van suid-afrika since 1994 the republic has had an official name in each of its 11 official languages mzansi derived from the xhosa noun umzantsi meaning south is a colloquial name for south africa while some pan-africanist political parties prefer the term azania history prehistoric archaeology south africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in gauteng province the area a unesco world heritage site has been branded the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa raymond dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child found near taung in 1924 further hominin remains have come from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo province cornelia and florisbad in the free state province border cave in kwazulu-natal province klasies river mouth in eastern cape province and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape province these finds suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus there followed species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least 170000 years various researchers have located pebble tools within the vaal river valley bantu expansion settlements of bantu-speaking peoples who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the 4th or 5th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modern-day kwazulu-natal province are believed to date from around 1050 the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga province several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantu-speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in 1487 the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on 4 december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in present-day namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo co cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after 8 january 1488 prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the present-day groot river in may 1488 but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperana or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in lus de cames portuguese epic poem the lusiads 1572 dutch colonisation by the early 17th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after 1647 when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in 1652 a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualling station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape became home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers lit free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe known as the xhosa wars as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in 1803 the cape was occupied again by the british in 1806 following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around 1818 subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions in the first two decades of the 19th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare indirectly led to the mfecane crushing in which 1000000 to 2000000 people were killed and the inland plateau was devastated and depopulated in the early 1820s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early 1800s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces the natalia republic kwazulu-natal and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglo-zulu war was fought in 1879 between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in 1874 sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the boers and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the termination of the zulu nations independence the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war 18801881 using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war 18991902 but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country anti-british policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of 1879 and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act 1909 granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on 31 may 1910 the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape transvaal and natal colonies as well as the orange free state republic the natives land act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only 7 of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in 1931 the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in 1934 the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and english-speaking whites in 1939 the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid in 1948 the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule taking canadas indian act as a framework the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than 20 controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalized segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in 1955 by the congress alliance demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination republic on 31 may 1961 the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the british-dominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governor-general charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary-appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of 1983 which eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a near-unique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it only in 1994 despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with anti-apartheid organisations such as the african national congress anc the azanian peoples organisation azapo and the pan-africanist congress pac carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors in the late 1970s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in 1974 enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately fw de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government in 1990 the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the anc and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after 27 years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from the white electorate in a 1992 referendum the government continued negotiations to end apartheid south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in 1994 which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc in post-apartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics but declined significantly using expanded definitions poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth the united nations un human development index hdi of south africa fell from 1995 to 2005 while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013 this is in large part attributable to the south african hivaids pandemic which saw south african life expectancy fall from a high point of 6225 years in 1992 to a low of 5257 in 2005 and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may 2008 riots left over 60 people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over 100000 people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly legal and illegal migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a 2006 survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the un high commissioner for refugees in 2008 reported over 200000 refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared nevertheless as south africa continues to grapple with racial issues one of the proposed solutions has been to pass legislation such as the pending hate crimes and hate speech bill to uphold south africas ban on racism and commitment to equality geography south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than 2500km 1553mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at 1219912km 471011sqmi according to the un demographic yearbook south africa is the 25th-largest country in the world it is about the same size as colombia twice the size of france three times as big as japan four times the size of italy and five times the size of the united kingdom mafadi in the drakensberg at 3450m 11320ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes 22 and 35s and longitudes 16 and 33e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1000m 3300ft and 2100m 6900ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and south-west this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and south-western parts of the plateau at approximately 11001800m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately 700800m above sea levelsee map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very north-west of the country the mid-eastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the countrys commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng to the north of highveld from about the 2530s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering 19633 square kilometres 7580 sq mi south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulu-natal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulu-natallesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over 3000m 9800ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate the coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately 400500m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semi-desert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area 700800m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langebergouteniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall especially in the george-knysna-plettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forest-poor country in the south-west corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the countrys border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to 37million people according to the 2011 population census it is the countrys legislative capital the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of north-south running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the 32s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the worlds most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring augustseptember south africa also has one possession the small sub-antarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island 290km or 110sqmi and prince edward island 45km or 17sqmi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with mozambique and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at 1740m 5709ft above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760mm 299in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the south-eastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as 15c 5f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of 517c 12506f was recorded in 1948 in the northern cape kalahari near upington but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment the official highest temperature is 488c 11984f at vioolsdrif in january 1993 biodiversity south africa signed the rio convention on biological diversity on 4 june 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 november 1995 it has subsequently produced a national biodiversity strategy and action plan which was received by the convention on 7 june 2006 the country is ranked sixth out of the worlds seventeen megadiverse countries animals numerous mammals are found in the bushveld including lions african leopards south african cheetahs southern white rhinos blue wildebeest kudus impalas hyenas hippopotamuses and south african giraffes a significant extent of the bushveld exists in the north-east including kruger national park and the sabi sand game reserve as well as in the far north in the waterberg biosphere south africa houses many endemic species among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit bunolagus monticullaris in the karoo fungi up to 1945 more than 4900 species of fungi including lichen-forming species had been recorded in 2006 the number of fungi in south africa was estimated at about 200000 species but did not take into account fungi associated with insects if correct then the number of south african fungi dwarfs that of its plants in at least some major south african ecosystems an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur the countrys biodiversity strategy and action plan does not mention fungi including lichen-forming fungi plants with more than 22000 different higher plants or about 9 of all the known species of plants on earth south africa is particularly rich in plant diversity the most prevalent biome in south africa is the grassland particularly on the highveld where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses low shrubs and acacia trees mainly camel-thorn vachellia erioloba and whitethorn v constricta vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall there are several species of water-storing succulents like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry namaqualand area the grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country with denser growth there are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area near the northern end of kruger national park the fynbos biome which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the cape floristic region one of the six floral kingdoms is located in a small region of the western cape and contains more than 9000 of those species making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity most of the plants are evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine needle-like leaves such as the sclerophyllous plants another uniquely south african flowering plant group is the genus protea there are around 130 different species of protea in south africa while south africa has a great wealth of flowering plants only 1 of south africa is forest almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of kwazulu-natal where there are also areas of southern africa mangroves in river mouths there are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire known as montane forests plantations of imported tree species are predominant particularly the non-native eucalyptus and pine conservation issues south africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades primarily due to overpopulation sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century south africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many eg black wattle port jackson willow hakea lantana and jacaranda posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources the original temperate forest found by the first european settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained currently south african hardwood trees like real yellowwood podocarpus latifolius stinkwood ocotea bullata and south african black ironwood olea laurifolia are under government protection statistics from the south african department of environmental affairs show a record 1215 rhinos have been killed in 2014 climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves flooding and drought according to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the south african national biodiversity institute parts of southern africa will see an increase in temperature by about 1c 18f along the coast to more than 4c 72f in the already hot hinterland such as the northern cape in late spring and summertime by 2050 the cape floral kingdom being identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots will be hit very hard by climate change drought increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction politics and government south africa is a parliamentary republic although unlike most such republics the president is both head of state and head of government and depends for his tenure on the confidence of parliament the executive legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the constitution and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of parliament if they are unconstitutional the national assembly the lower house of parliament consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation the national council of provinces the upper house consists of ninety members with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members after each parliamentary election the national assembly elects one of its members as president hence the president serves a term of office the same as that of the assembly normally five years no president may serve more than two terms in office the president appoints a deputy president and ministers who form the cabinet which consists of departments and ministries the president and the cabinet may be removed by the national assembly by a motion of no confidence in the most recent election held on 7 may 2014 the anc won 622 of the vote and 249 seats while the main opposition the democratic alliance da won 222 of the vote and 89 seats the economic freedom fighters eff founded by julius malema the former president of the ancs youth wing anc youth league who was later expelled from the anc won 64 of the vote and 25 seats the anc has been the governing political party in south africa since the end of apartheid south africa has no legally defined capital city the fourth chapter of the constitution of south africa states that the seat of parliament is cape town but an act of parliament enacted in accordance with section 761 and 5 may determine that the seat of parliament is elsewhere the countrys three branches of government are split over different cities cape town as the seat of parliament is the legislative capital pretoria as the seat of the president and cabinet is the administrative capital and bloemfontein as the seat of the supreme court of appeal is the judicial capital while the constitutional court of south africa sits in johannesburg most foreign embassies are located in pretoria since 2004 south africa has had many thousands of popular protests some violent making it according to one academic the most protest-rich country in the world there have been a number of incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of the constitution leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression or a decline in political tolerance in 2008 south africa placed 5th out of 48 sub-saharan african countries on the ibrahim index of african governance south africa scored well in the categories of rule of law transparency corruption and participation human rights but was let down by its relatively poor performance in safety security in november 2006 south africa became the first african country to legalise same-sex marriage law the constitution of south africa is the supreme rule of law in the country the primary sources of south african law are roman-dutch mercantile law and personal law with english common law as imports of dutch settlements and british colonialism the first european based law in south africa was brought by the dutch east india company and is called roman-dutch law it was imported before the codification of european law into the napoleonic code and is comparable in many ways to scots law this was followed in the 19th century by english law both common and statutory after unification in 1910 south africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for south africa building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies the judicial system consists of the magistrates courts which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases the high court which has divisions that serve as the courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas the supreme court of appeal and the constitutional court which is the highest court nearly 50 murders are committed each day in south africa in the year ended march 2014 there were 17068 murders and the murder rate was 322 per 100000 about five times higher than the global average of 6 per 100000 middle-class south africans seek security in gated communities the private security industry in south africa is the largest in the world with nearly 9000 registered companies and 400000 registered active private security guards more than the south african police and army combined many emigrants from south africa also state that crime was a major factor in their decision to leave crime against the farming community has continued to be a major problem south africa has a high rape rate with 43195 rapes reported in 201415 and an unknown number of sexual assaults going unreported a 2009 survey found one in four south african men admitted to raping someone and another survey found one in three women out of 4000 surveyed said they had been raped in the past year rapes are also perpetrated by children some as young as ten the incidence of child and infant rape is among the highest in the world largely as a result of the virgin cleansing myth and a number of high-profile cases sometimes as young as eight months have outraged the nation foreign relations as the union of south africa the country was a founding member of the un the then prime minister jan smuts wrote the preamble to the un charter south africa is one of the founding members of the african union au and has the second largest economy of all the members it is also a founding

south africa has a mixed economy the second largest in africa after nigeria it also has a relatively high gross domestic product gdp per capita compared to other countries in sub-saharan africa us11750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012 despite this south africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality measured by the gini coefficient unlike most of the worlds poor countries south africa does not have a thriving informal economy only 15 of south african jobs are in the informal sector compared with around half in brazil and india and nearly three-quarters in indonesia the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd attributes this difference to south africas widespread welfare system world bank research shows that south africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita gdp versus its human development index hdi ranking with only botswana showing a larger gap after 1994 government policy brought down inflation stabilised public finances and some foreign capital was attracted however growth was still subpar from 2004 onward economic growth picked up significantly both employment and capital formation increased during the presidency of jacob zuma the government increased the role of state-owned enterprises soes some of the biggest soes are

criticism from neva makgetla lead economist for research and information at the development bank of southern africa for focusing almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people which does little to address broader economic disparities though the rich may become more diverse official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class other problems include state ownership and interference which impose high barriers to entry in many areas restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise along with many african nations south africa has been experiencing a brain drain in the past 20 years and is almost certainly detrimental for the wellbeing of those reliant on the healthcare infrastructure the skills drain in south africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of south africa and has thus resulted in large white south african communities abroad however the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts according to several surveys there has been a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 20082009 and expiration of foreign work contracts in the first quarter of 2011 confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84 in a professional provident society pps survey illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading many immigrants to south africa continue to live in poor conditions and the immigration

out by world-leader verisign despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology information technology and other high technology fields no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in south africa it is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology based on the realisation that south africa cannot compete with far eastern economies in manufacturing nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity south africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community it hosts the southern african large telescope the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere south africa is currently building the karoo array telescope as a pathfinder for the 15billion square kilometre array project on 25 may 2012 it was announced that hosting of the square kilometer array telescope will be split over both the south african and the australia and new zealand sites water supply and sanitation two distinctive features of the south african water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities these features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers leading to a lack of attention to maintenance following the end of apartheid the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66 to 79 from 1990 to 2010 sanitation access increased from 71 to 79 during the same period however water supply and sanitation in south africa has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry the eastern parts of south africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the el nio weather phenomenon in early 2018 cape town which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country faced a water crisis as the citys water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of june water-saving measures were in effect that

includes the oldest art objects in the world which were discovered in a south african cave and dated from 75000 years ago the scattered tribes of khoisan peoples moving into south africa from around 10000 bc had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings they were superseded by bantunguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms new forms of art evolved in the mines and townships a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes the dutch-influenced folk art of the afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists earnestly following changing european traditions from the 1850s onwards also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve today south african literature emerged from a unique social and political history
