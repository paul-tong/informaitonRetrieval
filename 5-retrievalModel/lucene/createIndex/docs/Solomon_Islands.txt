ancestors of the polynesians the lapita people arrived from the bismarck archipelago with their characteristic ceramics european contact 1568 the first european to visit the islands was the spanish navigator lvaro de mendaa de neira coming from peru in 1568 some of the earliest and most regular foreign visitors to the islands were whaling vessels from britain the united states and australia they came for food wood and water from late in the 18th century and later took aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships relations between the islanders and visiting seamen was not always good and sometimes there was violence and bloodshed missionaries began visiting the solomons in the mid-19th century they made little progress at first because blackbirding the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the sugar plantations in queensland and fiji led to a series of reprisals and massacres the evils of the slave trade prompted the united kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern solomons in june 1893 in 1898 and 1899 more outlying islands were added to the protectorate in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago an area previously under german jurisdiction was transferred to british administration apart from the islands of buka and bougainville which remained under german administration as part of german new guinea traditional trade and social intercourse between the western solomon islands of mono and alu the shortlands and the traditional societies in the south of bougainville however continued without hindrance missionaries settled in the solomons under the protectorate converting most of the population to christianity in the early 20th century several british and australian firms began large-scale coconut planting economic growth was slow however and the islanders benefited little journalist joe melvin visited in 1892 as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding in 1908 the islands were visited by jack london who was cruising the pacific on his boat the snark second world war with the outbreak of the second world war most planters and traders were evacuated to australia and most cultivation ceased some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the solomons the most significant of the allied forces operations against the japanese imperial forces was launched on 7 august 1942 with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the florida islands at tulagi and red beach on guadalcanal the battle of guadalcanal became an important and bloody campaign fought in the pacific war as the allies began to repulse japanese expansion of strategic importance during the war were the coastwatchers operating in remote locations often on japanese held islands providing early warning and intelligence of japanese naval army and aircraft movements during the campaign sergeant-major jacob vouza was a notable coastwatcher who after capture refused to divulge allied information in spite of interrogation and torture by japanese imperial forces he was awarded a silver star medal by the americans which is the united states third-highest decoration for valor in combat islanders biuku gasa and eroni kumana were the first to find the shipwrecked john f kennedy and his crew of the pt-109 they suggested writing a rescue message on a coconut and delivered the coconut by paddling a dugout canoe the coconut was later kept on kennedys desk when he became president of the united states the solomon islands was one of the major staging areas of the south pacific and was home to the famous vmf-214 black sheep squadron commanded by major greg pappy boyington the slot was a name for new georgia sound when it was used by the tokyo express to supply the japanese garrison on guadalcanal of

september 2012 the duke and duchess of cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of queen elizabeth ii ethnic violence 19982003 commonly referred to as the tensions or the ethnic tension the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the isatabu freedom movement also known as the guadalcanal revolutionary army and the malaita eagle force as well as the marau eagle force although much of the conflict was between guales and malaitans kabutaulaka 2001 and dinnen 2002 argue that the ethnic conflict label is an oversimplification in late 1998 militants on the island of guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards malaitan settlers during the next year thousands of malaitans fled back to malaita or to the capital honiara which although situated on guadalcanal is predominantly populated by malaitans and solomon islanders from other provinces in 1999 the malaita eagle force mef was established in response the reformist government of bartholomew ulufaalu struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict in late 1999 the government declared a four-month state of emergency there were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail ulufaalu also requested assistance from australia and new zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected in june 2000 ulufaalu was kidnapped by militia members of the mef who felt that although he was a malaitan he was not doing enough to protect their interests ulufaalu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release manasseh sogavare who had earlier been finance minister in ulufaalus government but had subsequently joined the opposition was elected as prime minister by 2321 over rev leslie boseto however sogavares election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six mps thought to be supporters of boseto were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote moore 2004 n5 on p174 in october 2000 the townsville peace agreement was signed by the malaita eagle force elements of the ifm and the solomon islands government this was closely followed by the marau peace agreement in february 2001 signed by the marau eagle force the isatabu freedom movement the guadalcanal provincial government and the solomon islands government however a key guale militant leader harold keke refused to sign the agreement causing a split with the guale groups subsequently guale signatories to the agreement led by andrew tee joined with the malaitan-dominated police to form the joint operations force during the next two years the conflict moved to the weathercoast of guadalcanal as the joint operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture keke and his group new elections in december 2001 brought sir allan kemakeza into the prime ministers chair with the support of his peoples alliance party and the association of independent members law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted there was continuing violence on the weathercoast while militants in honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion the department of finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive in december 2002 finance minister laurie chan resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants conflict also broke out in western province between locals and malaitan settlers renegade members of the bougainville revolutionary army bra were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented the prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness widespread extortion and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the solomon islands government for outside help with the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos the request was unanimously supported in parliament in july 2003 australian and pacific island police and troops arrived in solomon islands under the auspices of the australian-led regional assistance mission to solomon islands ramsi a sizeable international security contingent of 2200 police and troops led by australia and new zealand and with representatives from about 20 other pacific nations began arriving the next month under operation helpem fren since this time some commentators have considered the country a failed state however other academics argue that rather than being a failed state it is an unformed state a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence in april 2006 allegations that the newly elected prime minister snyder rini had used bribes from chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of parliament led to mass rioting in the capital honiara a deep underlying resentment against the minority chinese business community led to much of chinatown in the city being destroyed tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to china china sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of chinese who fled to avoid the riots evacuation of australian and british citizens was on a much smaller scale additional australian new zealand and fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in parliament and parliament elected manasseh sogavare as prime minister earthquakes on 2 april 2007 at 073956 local time utc11

fatutaka and falkie atoll the countrys islands lie between latitudes 5 and 13s and longitudes 155 and 169e the distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1500 kilometres 930mi the santa cruz islands of which tikopia is part are situated north of vanuatu and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres 120mi from the other islands bougainville is geographically part of the solomon islands archipelago but politically part of papua new guinea falkie atoll which is closer to bougainville than to choiseul is part of the nation of solomon islands climate the islands ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year with a mean temperature of 265c 797f and few extremes of temperature or weather june through august is the cooler period though seasons are not pronounced the northwesterly winds of november through april bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones the annual rainfall is about 3050 millimetres 120in ecology the solomon islands archipelago is part of two distinct terrestrial ecoregions most of the islands are part of the solomon islands rain forests ecoregion which also includes the islands of bougainville and buka these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities the santa cruz islands are part of the vanuatu rain forests ecoregion together with the neighbouring archipelago of vanuatu soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic there are volcanoes with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands to relatively infertile limestone more than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape the islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes the tinakula and kavachi volcanoes are the most active water and sanitation see also human rights in solomon islands scarcity of fresh water sources and lack of sanitation has been a constant challenge facing solomon islands reducing the number of those living without access to fresh water and sanitation by half was one of the 2015 millennium development goals mdgs implemented by the united nations through goal 7 to ensure environmental sustainability though the islands generally have access to fresh water sources it is typically only available in the states capital of honiara and it is not guaranteed all year long according to a unicef report even the capitals poorest communities do not have access to adequate places to relieve their waste and an estimated 70 solomon island schools have no access to safe and clean water for drinking washing and relieving of waste lack of safe drinking water in school-age children results in high risks of contracting fatal diseases such as cholera and typhoid the number of solomon islanders living with piped drinking water has been decreasing since 2011 while those living with non-piped water increased between 2000 and 2010 nevertheless one improvement is that those living with non-piped water has been decreasing consistently since 2011 in addition the solomon islands second rural development program enacted in 2014 and active until 2020 has been working to deliver competent infrastructure and other vital services to rural areas and villages of the solomon islands which suffer the most from lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation through improved infrastructure services and resources the program has also encouraged farmers and other agricultural sectors through community-driven efforts to connect them to the market thus promoting economic growth rural villages such as bolava found in the western province of solomon islands have benefited greatly from the program with the implementation of water tanks and rain catchment and water storage systems not only has the improved infrastructure increased the quality of life in solomon islands the services are also operated and developed by the community thus creating a sense of communal pride and achievement among those previously living in hazardous conditions the program is funded by various international development actors such as the world bank european union international fund for agricultural development ifad and the australian and solomon islands governments economy solomon islands per-capita gdp of 600 ranks it as a lesser developed nation and more than 75 of its labour force is engaged in subsistence and fishing most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported until 1998 when world prices for tropical timber fell steeply timber was solomon islands main export product and in recent years solomon islands forests were dangerously overexploited other important cash crops and exports include copra and palm oil in 1998 gold mining began at gold ridge on guadalcanal minerals exploration in other areas continued in the wake of the ethnic violence in june 2000 exports of palm oil and gold ceased while exports of timber fell the islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead zinc nickel and gold solomon islands fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion a japanese joint venture solomon taiyo ltd which operated the only fish cannery in the country closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances though the plant has reopened under local management the export of tuna has not resumed negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the gold ridge mine and the major oil-palm plantation tourism particularly diving is an important service industry for solomon islands tourism growth is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations the solomon islands government was insolvent by 2002 since the ramsi intervention in 2003 the government has recast its budget it has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with australian backing is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations principal aid donors are australia new zealand the european union japan and the republic of china taiwan recently solomon islands courts have re-approved the export of live dolphins for profit most recently to dubai united arab emirates this practice was originally stopped by the government in 2004 after international uproar over a shipment of 28 live dolphins to mexico the move resulted in criticism from both australia and new zealand as well as several conservation organisations the solomon islands dollar iso 4217 code sbd was introduced in 1977 replacing the australian pound sterling its symbol is si but the si prefix may be omitted if there is no confusion

parts of the country for trade shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the pacific islands in solomon islands it is mostly manufactured in malaita and guadalcanal but can be bought elsewhere such as the honiara central market the barter system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas energy a team of renewable energy developers working for the south pacific applied geoscience commission sopac and funded by the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership reeep have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy such as solar water and wind power without the need to raise substantial sums of cash under the scheme islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops demographics as

studies have resulted in the better understanding of the blond gene the findings show that the blond hair trait is due to an amino acid change of protein tyrp1 this accounts for the highest occurrence

one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence fsv in the world with 64 of women aged 1549 having reported physical andor sexual abuse by a partner as per a world health organization who report issued in 2011 the causes of gender based violence gbv are multiple but it primarily stems from gender inequality and its manifestations the report stated another manifestation and driver of gender inequality in solomon islands is the traditional practice of bride price although specific customs vary between communities paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title giving men ownership over women gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to control their wives often through violence while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men another report issued by the who in 2013 painted a similarly grim picture in 2014 solomon islands officially launched the family protection act 2014 aimed at curbing domestic violence in the country while numerous other interventions are being developed and implemented in the healthcare system as well as the criminal justice system these interventions are still in their infancy and have largely stemmed from western protocols therefore for these models to be effective time and commitment is needed to change the cultural perception of domestic violence in solomon islands see also oceania portal
