it is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient land of punt during the middle ages several powerful somali empires dominated the regional trade including the ajuran empire the adal sultanate the warsangali sultanate and the sultanate of the geledi in the late 19th century through a succession of treaties with these kingdoms the british and italian empires gained control of parts of the coast and established the colonies of british somaliland and italian somaliland in the interior mohammed abdullah hassans movement repelled the british empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region before succumbing to defeat in 1920 by british airpower the toponym somalia was coined by the italian explorer luigi robecchi bricchetti 18551926 italy acquired full control of the northeastern central and southern parts of the area after successfully waging the so-called campaign of the sultanates against the ruling majeerteen sultanate and sultanate of hobyo italian occupation lasted until 1941 yielding to british military administration british somaliland would remain a protectorate while italian somaliland in 1949 became a united nations trusteeship under italian administration the trust territory of somaliland in 1960 the two regions united to form the independent somali republic under a civilian government the supreme revolutionary council seized power in 1969 and established the somali democratic republic led by mohamed siad barre this government later collapsed in 1991 as the somali civil war broke out various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum particularly in the south during this period due to the absence of a central government somalia was a failed state and residents returned to customary and religious law in most regions a few autonomous regions including the somaliland and puntland administrations emerged in the north the early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations the transitional national government tng was established in 2000 followed by the formation of the transitional federal government tfg in 2004 which reestablished national institutions such as the military in 2006 the tfg assisted by ethiopian troops assumed control of most of the nations southern conflict zones from the newly formed islamic courts union icu the icu subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as al-shabaab which battled the tfg and its amisom allies for control of the region by mid-2012 the insurgents had lost most of the territory that they had seized in 20112012 a political process providing benchmarks for the establishment of permanent democratic institutions was launched within this administrative framework a new provisional constitution was passed in august 2012 which reformed somalia as a federation following the end of the tfgs interim mandate the same month the federal government of somalia the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war was formed and a period of reconstruction began in mogadishu somalia has maintained an informal economy mainly based on livestock remittances from somalis working abroad and telecommunications somalia is a member of the united nations the arab league african union non-aligned movement and the organisation of islamic cooperation history prehistory somalia has been inhabited since at least the paleolithic during the stone age the doian and hargeisan cultures flourished here the oldest evidence of burial customs in the horn of africa comes from cemeteries in somalia dating back to the 4th millennium bce the stone implements from the jalelo site in the north were also characterized in 1909 as important artefacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the paleolithic between the east and the west according to linguists the first afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing neolithic period from the familys proposed urheimat original homeland in the nile valley or the near east the laas geel complex on the outskirts of hargeisa in northwestern somalia dates back around 5000 years and has rock art depicting both wild animals and decorated cows other cave paintings are found in the northern dhambalin region which feature one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback the rock art is in the distinctive ethiopian-arabian style dated to 1000 to 3000 bce additionally between the towns of las khorey and el ayo in northern somalia lies karinhegane the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals each painting has an inscription below it which collectively have been estimated to be around 2500 years old antiquity and classical era ancient pyramidical structures mausoleums ruined cities and stone walls such as the wargaade wall are evidence of an old civilization that once thrived in the somali peninsula this civilization enjoyed a trading relationship with ancient egypt and mycenaean greece since the second millennium bce supporting the hypothesis that somalia or adjacent regions were the location of the ancient land of punt the puntites traded myrrh spices gold ebony short-horned cattle ivory and frankincense with the egyptians phoenicians babylonians indians chinese and romans through their commercial ports an egyptian expedition sent to punt by the 18th dynasty queen hatshepsut is recorded on the temple reliefs at deir el-bahari during the reign of the puntite king parahu and queen ati in 2015 isotopic analysis of ancient baboon mummies from punt that had been brought to egypt as gifts indicated that the specimens likely originated from an area encompassing eastern somalia and the eritrea-ethiopia corridor in the classical era the macrobians who may have been ancestral to somalis established a powerful tribal kingdom that ruled large parts of modern somalia they were reputed for their longevity and wealth and were said to be the tallest and handsomest of all men the macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers according to herodotus account the persian emperor cambyses ii upon his conquest of egypt 525 bc sent ambassadors to macrobia bringing luxury gifts for the macrobian king to entice his submission the macrobian ruler who was elected based on his stature and beauty replied instead with a challenge for his persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow if the persians could manage to draw it they would have the right to invade his country but until then they should thank the gods that the macrobians never decided to invade their empire the macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and gold wealth which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains the camel is believed to have been domesticated in the horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium bce from there it spread to egypt and the maghreb during the classical period the northern barbara city-states of mosylon opone mundus isis malao avalites essina nikon and sarapion developed a lucrative trade network connecting with merchants from ptolemaic egypt ancient greece phoenicia parthian persia saba the nabataean kingdom and the roman empire they used the ancient somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo after the roman conquest of the nabataean empire and the roman naval presence at aden to curb piracy arab and somali merchants agreed with the romans to bar indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the arabian peninsula to protect the interests of somali and arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the red and mediterranean seas however indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the somali peninsula which was free from roman interference for centuries indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to somalia and arabia from ceylon and the spice islands the source of the cinnamon and other spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of arab and somali merchants in their trade with the roman and greek world the romans and greeks believed the source to have been the somali peninsula the collusive agreement among somali and arab traders inflated the price of indian and chinese cinnamon in north africa the near east and europe and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator especially for the somali merchants through whose hands large quantities were shipped across sea and land routes birth of islam and the middle ages islam was introduced to the area early on from the arabian peninsula shortly after the masjid al-qiblatayn zeilas two-mihrab masjid al-qiblatayn dates to the 7th century and is the oldest mosque in africa in the late 9th century al-yaqubi wrote that muslims were living along the northern somali seaboard he also mentioned that the adal kingdom had its capital in the city according to leo africanus the adal sultanate was governed by local somali dynasties and its realm encompassed the geographical area between the bab el mandeb and cape guardafui it was thus flanked to the south by the ajuran empire and to the west by the abyssinian empire in 1332 the zeila-based king of adal was slain in a military campaign aimed at halting abyssinian emperor amda seyon is march toward the city when the last sultan of ifat saad ad-din ii was also killed by emperor dawit i in zeila in 1410 his children escaped to yemen before returning in 1415 in the early 15th century adals capital was moved further inland to the town of dakkar where sabr ad-din ii the eldest son of saad ad-din ii established a new base after his return from yemen adals headquarters were again relocated the following century this time southward to harar from this new capital adal organised an effective army led by imam ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazi ahmad gurey or gran both meaning the left-handed that invaded the abyssinian empire this 16th-century campaign is historically known as the conquest of abyssinia futuh al-habash during the war imam ahmad pioneered the use of cannons supplied by the ottoman empire which he imported through zeila and deployed against abyssinian forces and their portuguese allies led by cristvo da gama some scholars argue that this conflict proved through their use on both sides the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket cannon and the arquebus over traditional weapons during the ajuran sultanate period the sultanates and republics of merca mogadishu barawa hobyo and their respective ports flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from arabia india venetia persia egypt portugal and as far away as china vasco da gama who passed by mogadishu in the 15th century noted that it was a large city with houses several storeys high and large palaces in its centre in addition to many mosques with cylindrical minarets the harla an early hamitic group of tall stature who inhabited parts of somalia tchertcher and other areas in the horn also erected various tumuli these masons are believed to have been ancestral to ethnic somalis in the 16th century duarte barbosa noted that many ships from the kingdom of cambaya in modern-day india sailed to mogadishu with cloth and spices for which they in return received gold wax and ivory barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat wheat barley horses and fruit on the coastal markets which generated enormous wealth for the merchants mogadishu the center of a thriving textile industry known as toob benadir specialized for the markets in egypt among other places together with merca and barawa also served as a transit stop for swahili merchants from mombasa and malindi and for the gold trade from kilwa jewish merchants from the hormuz brought their indian textile and fruit to the somali coast in exchange for grain and wood trading relations were established with malacca in the 15th century with cloth ambergris and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade giraffes zebras and incense were exported to the ming empire of china which established somali merchants as leaders in the commerce between east asia and the horn hindu merchants from surat and southeast african merchants from pate seeking to bypass both the portuguese blockade and omani interference used the somali ports of merca and barawa which were out of the two powers jurisdiction to conduct their trade in safety and without interference early modern era and the scramble for africa in the early modern period successor states to the adal sultanate and ajuran sultanate began to flourish in somalia these included the warsangali sultanate the bari dynasties the sultanate of the geledi gobroon dynasty the majeerteen sultanate migiurtinia and the sultanate of hobyo obbia they continued the tradition of castle-building and seaborne trade established by previous somali empires sultan yusuf mahamud ibrahim the third sultan of the house of gobroon started the golden age of the gobroon dynasty his army came out victorious during the bardheere jihad which restored stability in the region and revitalized the east african ivory trade he also received presents from and had cordial relations with the rulers of neighbouring and distant kingdoms such as the omani witu and yemeni sultans sultan ibrahims son ahmed yusuf succeeded him and was one of the most important figures in 19th-century east africa receiving tribute from omani governors and creating alliances with important muslim families on the east african coast in northern somalia the gerad dynasty conducted trade with yemen and persia and competed with the merchants of the bari dynasty the gerads and the bari sultans built impressive palaces and fortresses and had close relations with many different empires in the near east in the late 19th century after the berlin conference of 1884 european powers began the scramble for africa which inspired the dervish leader mohammed abdullah hassan to rally support from across the horn of africa and begin one of the longest colonial resistance wars ever in several of his poems and speeches hassan emphasized that the british have destroyed our religion and made our children their children and that the christian ethiopians in league with the british were bent upon plundering the political and religious freedom of the somali nation he soon emerged as a champion of his countrys political and religious freedom defending it against all christian invaders hassan issued a religious ordinance stipulating that any somali national who did not accept the goal of unity of somalia and would not fight under his leadership would be considered to be kafir or gaal he soon acquired weapons from the ottoman empire sudan other islamic and arabian countries and appointed ministers and advisers to administer different areas or sectors of somalia in addition he gave a clarion call for somali unity and independence in the process organizing his forces hassans dervish movement had an essentially military character and the dervish revolt was fashioned on the model of a salihiya brotherhood it was characterized by a rigid hierarchy and centralization though hassan threatened to drive the christians into the sea he executed the first attack by launching his first major military offensive with his 1500 dervish equipped with 20 modern rifles on the british soldiers stationed in the region he repulsed the british in four expeditions and had relations with the central powers of the ottomans and the germans in 1920 the dervish movement collapsed after intensive aerial bombardments by britain and dervish territories were subsequently turned into a protectorate the dawn of fascism in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for italy as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of la grande somalia according to the plan of fascist italy with the arrival of governor cesare maria de vecchi on 15 december 1923 things began to change for that part of somaliland known as italian somaliland italy had access to these areas under the successive protection treaties but not direct rule the fascist government had direct rule only over the benadir territory fascist italy under benito mussolini attacked abyssinia ethiopia in 1935 with an aim to colonize it the invasion was condemned by the league of nations but little was done to stop it or to liberate occupied ethiopia on 3 august 1940 italian troops including somali colonial units crossed from ethiopia to invade british somaliland and by 14 august succeeded in taking berbera from the british a british force including troops from several african countries launched the campaign in january 1941 from kenya to liberate british somaliland and italian-occupied ethiopia and conquer italian somaliland by february most of italian somaliland was captured and in march british somaliland was retaken from the sea the forces of the british empire operating in somaliland comprised the three divisions of south african west african and east african troops they were assisted by somali forces led by abdulahi hassan with somalis of the isaaq dhulbahante and warsangali clans prominently participating the number of italian somalis began to decline after world war ii with fewer than 10000 remaining in 1960 independence 19601969 following world war ii britain retained control of both british somaliland and italian somaliland as protectorates in 1945 during the potsdam conference the united nations granted italy trusteeship of italian somaliland as the trust territory of somaliland on the conditionfirst proposed by the somali youth league syl and other nascent somali political organizations such as hizbia digil mirifle somali hdms and the somali national league snlthat somalia achieve independence within ten years british somaliland remained a protectorate of britain until 1960 to the extent that italy held the territory by un mandate the trusteeship provisions gave the somalis the opportunity to gain experience in western political education and self-government these were advantages that british somaliland which was to be incorporated into the new somali state did not have although in the 1950s british colonial officials attempted through various administrative development efforts to make up for past neglect the protectorate stagnated the disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulties integrating the two parts meanwhile in 1948 under pressure from their world war ii allies and to the dismay of the somalis the british returned the haud an important somali grazing area that was presumably protected by british treaties with the somalis in 1884 and 1886 and the ogaden to ethiopia based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the british ceded somali territory to the ethiopian emperor menelik in exchange for his help against possible advances by the french britain included the conditional provision that the somali residents would retain their autonomy but ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area this prompted an unsuccessful bid by britain in 1956 to buy back the somali lands it had turned over britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively somali-inhabited northern frontier district nfd to kenyan nationalists this was despite a plebiscite in which according to a british colonial commission almost all of the territorys ethnic somalis favored joining the newly formed somali republic a referendum was held in neighbouring djibouti then known as french somaliland in 1958 on the eve of somalias independence in 1960 to decide whether or not to join the somali republic or to remain with france the referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with france largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizeable afar ethnic group and resident europeans there was also widespread vote rigging with the french expelling thousands of somalis before the referendum reached the polls the majority of those who voted no were somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united somalia as had been proposed by mahmoud harbi vice president of the government council harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later djibouti finally gained its independence from france in 1977 and hassan gouled aptidon a somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1976 eventually became djiboutis first president 19771999 on 1 july 1960 the two territories united to form the somali republic albeit within boundaries drawn up by italy and britain a government was formed by abdullahi issa and muhammad haji ibrahim egal with other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments with haji bashir ismail yusuf as president of the somali national assembly aden abdullah osman daar as president of the somali republic and abdirashid ali shermarke as prime minister later to become president from 1967 to 1969 on 20 july 1961 and through a popular referendum the people of somalia ratified a new constitution which was first drafted in 1960 in 1967 muhammad haji ibrahim egal became prime minister a position to which he was appointed by shermarke egal would later become the president of the autonomous somaliland region in northwestern somalia on 15 october 1969 while paying a visit to the northern town of las anod somalias then president abdirashid ali shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards his assassination was quickly followed by a military coup dtat on 21 october 1969 the day after his funeral in which the somali army seized power without encountering armed opposition essentially a bloodless takeover the putsch was spearheaded by major general mohamed siad barre who at the time commanded the army somali democratic republic 19691991 alongside barre the supreme revolutionary council src that assumed power after president sharmarkes assassination was led by lieutenant colonel salaad gabeyre kediye and chief of police jama korshel kediye officially held the title father of the revolution and barre shortly afterwards became the head of the src the src subsequently renamed the country the somali democratic republic dissolved the parliament and the supreme court and suspended the constitution the revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate in addition to a nationalization program of industry and land the new regimes foreign policy placed an emphasis on somalias traditional and religious links with the arab world eventually joining the arab league al in 1974 that same year barre also served as chairman of the organisation of african unity oau the predecessor of the african union au in july 1976 barres src disbanded itself and established in its place the somali revolutionary socialist party srsp a one-party government based on scientific socialism and islamic tenets the srsp was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by adapting marxist precepts to local circumstances emphasis was placed on the muslim principles of social progress equality and justice which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency public participation and popular control as well as direct ownership of the means of production while the srsp encouraged private investment on a limited scale the administrations overall direction was essentially communist in july 1977 the ogaden war broke out after barres government played the national unity card to justify an aggressive incorporation of the predominantly somali-inhabited ogaden region of ethiopia into a pan-somali greater somalia along with the rich agricultural lands of south-eastern ethiopia infrastructure and strategically important areas as far north as djibouti in the first week of the conflict somali armed forces took southern and central ogaden and for most of the war the somali army scored continuous victories on the ethiopian army and followed them as far as sidamo by september 1977 somalia controlled 90 of the ogaden and captured strategic cities such as jijiga and put heavy pressure on dire dawa threatening the train route from the latter city to djibouti after the siege of harar a massive unprecedented soviet intervention consisting of 20000 cuban forces and several thousand soviet experts came to the aid of ethiopias communist derg regime by 1978 the somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the ogaden this shift in support by the soviet union motivated the barre government to seek allies elsewhere it eventually settled on the soviets cold war arch-rival the united states which had been courting the somali government for some time all in all somalias initial friendship with the soviet union and later partnership with the united states enabled it to build the largest army in africa a new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a peoples assembly were held however barres somali revolutionary socialist party politburo continued to rule in october 1980 the srsp was disbanded and the supreme revolutionary council was re-established in its place by that time barres government had become increasingly unpopular many somalis had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship the regime was weakened further in the 1980s as the cold war drew to a close and somalias strategic importance was diminished the government became increasingly authoritarian and resistance movements encouraged by ethiopia sprang up across the country eventually leading to the somali civil war among the militia groups were the somali salvation democratic front ssdf united somali congress usc somali national movement snm and the somali patriotic movement spm together with the non-violent political oppositions of the somali democratic movement sdm the somali democratic alliance sda and the somali manifesto group smg during 1990 in the capital city of mogadishu the residents were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four fuel shortages caused long lines of cars at petrol stations inflation had driven the price of pasta ordinary dry italian noodles a staple at that time to five us dollars per kilogram the price of khat imported daily from kenya was also five us dollars per standard bunch paper currency notes were of such low value that several bundles were needed to pay for simple restaurant meals a thriving black market existed in the centre of the city as banks experienced shortages of local currency for exchange at night the city of mogadishu lay in darkness close monitoring of all visiting foreigners was in effect harsh exchange control regulations were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency although no travel restrictions were placed on foreigners photographing many locations was banned during the day in mogadishu the appearance of any government military force was extremely rare alleged late-night operations by government authorities however included disappearances of individuals from their homes somali civil war in 1991 the barre administration was ousted by a coalition of clan-based opposition groups backed by ethiopias then-ruling derg regime and libya following a meeting of the somali national movement and northern clans elders the northern former british portion of the country declared its independence as somaliland in may 1991 although de facto independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south it has not been recognized by any foreign government many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of barres regime in the south armed factions led by usc commanders general mohamed farah aidid and ali mahdi mohamed in particular clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital in 1991 a multi-phased international conference on somalia was held in neighbouring djibouti aidid boycotted the first meeting in protest due to the legitimacy bestowed on muhammad by the djibouti conference he was subsequently recognized by the international community as the new president of somalia djibouti egypt saudi arabia and italy were among the countries that officially extended recognition to muhammads administration he was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of somalia and with autonomous subnational entities in the north the djibouti conference was followed by two abortive agreements for national reconciliation and disarmament which were signed by 15 political stakeholders an agreement to hold an informal preparatory meeting on national reconciliation and the 1993 addis ababa agreement made at the conference on national reconciliation in the early 1990s due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority somalia began to be characterized as a failed state political scientist ken menkhaus argues that evidence suggested that the nation had already attained failed state status by the mid-1980s while robert i rotberg similarly posits that the state failure had preceded the ouster of the barre administration hoehne 2009 branwen 2009 and verhoeven 2009 also used somalia during this period as a case study to critique various aspects of the state failure discourse un security council resolution 733 and un security council resolution 746 led to the creation of unosom i the first mission to provide humanitarian relief and help restore order in somalia after the dissolution of its central government united nations security council resolution 794 was unanimously passed on 3 december 1992 which approved a coalition of united nations peacekeepers led by the united states forming the unified task force unitaf the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts aimed at stabilizing the situation were transferred to the un landing in 1993 the un peacekeeping coalition started the two-year united nations operation in somalia ii unosom ii primarily in the south unitafs original mandate was to use all necessary means to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in accordance to chapter vii of the united nations charter and is regarded as a success aidid saw unosom ii as a threat to his power and in june 1993 his militia attacked pakistan army troops attached to unosom ii see somalia march 1992 to february 1996 in mogadishu inflicting over 80 casualties fighting escalated until 19 american troops and more than 1000 civilians and militia were killed in a raid in mogadishu during october 1993 the un withdrew operation united shield on 3 march 1995 having suffered significant casualties and with the rule of government still not restored in august 1996 aidid was killed in mogadishu former un secretary general boutros boutros ghali and ahmedou ould abdallah un special envoy to somalia have referred to the killing of civilians during the conflict as a genocide under the auspices of the un au arab league and igad a series of additional national reconciliation conferences were subsequently held as part of the peace process among these summits were the 1997 national salvation council in sodere ethiopia the 1997 cairo peace conference cairo declaration the 2000 somalia national peace conference in arta djibouti under the newly established transitional national government the 2002 somali reconciliation conference in eldoret kenya the 2003 national reconciliation conference in nairobi kenya when the transitional federal government was established and the transitional federal charter was adopted the 2004 nairobi conference and the 2007 national reconciliation conference in mogadishu following the outbreak of the civil war many of somalias residents left in search of asylum according to the unhcr there were around 975951 registered refugees from the country in neighboring states as of 2016 additionally 11 million people were internally displaced persons idps the majority of the idps were bantus and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions including those displaced in the north an estimated 60 of the idps were children causes of the displacement included armed violence periodic droughts and other natural disasters which along with diverted aid flows hindered the idps access to safe shelter and resources idp settlements were concentrated in south-central somalia 893000 followed by the northern puntland 129000 and somaliland 84000 regions additionally there were around 9356 registered refugees and 11157 registered asylum seekers in somalia most of these foreign nationals emigrated from yemen to northern somalia after the houthi insurgency in 2015 however the majority of emigrants to somalia consist of somali expatriates who have returned to mogadishu and other urban areas for investment opportunities and to take part in the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process a consequence of the collapse of governmental authority that accompanied the civil war was the emergence of piracy in the unpatrolled indian ocean waters off of the coast of somalia the phenomenon arose as an attempt by local fishermen to protect their livelihood from illegal fishing by foreign trawlers in august 2008 a multinational coalition took on the task of combating the piracy by establishing a maritime security patrol area mspa within the gulf of aden a maritime police force was also later formed in the puntland region and best management practices including hiring private armed guards were adopted by ship owners these combined efforts led to a sharp decline in incidents by october 2012 pirate attacks had dropped to a six-year low with only 1 ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011 transitional institutions the transitional national government tng was established in aprilmay 2000 at the somalia national peace conference snpc held in arta djibouti abdiqasim salad hassan was selected as the president of the nations new transitional national government tng an interim administration formed to guide somalia to its third permanent republican government the tngs internal problems led to the replacement of the prime minister four times in three years and the administrative bodys reported bankruptcy in december 2003 its

tfis of government as defined in the transitional federal charter tfc adopted in november 2004 by the transitional federal parliament tfp the transitional federal government officially comprised the executive branch of government with the tfp serving as the legislative branch the government was headed by the president of somalia to whom the cabinet reported through the prime minister however it was also used as a general term to refer to all three branches collectively islamic courts union and ethiopian intervention in 2006 the islamic courts union icu an islamist organization assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and promptly imposed sharia law the transitional federal government sought to reestablish its authority and with the assistance of ethiopian troops african union peacekeepers and air support by the united states managed to drive out the rival icu and solidify its rule on 8 january 2007 as the battle of ras kamboni raged tfg president and founder abdullahi yusuf ahmed a former colonel in the somali army and decorated war hero entered mogadishu with the ethiopian military support for the first time since being elected to office the government then relocated to villa somalia in the capital from its interim location in baidoa this marked the first time since the fall of the siad barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country following this defeat the islamic courts union splintered into several different factions some of the more radical elements including al-shabaab regrouped to continue their insurgency against the tfg and oppose the ethiopian militarys presence in somalia throughout 2007 and 2008 al-shabaab scored military victories seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern somalia at the end of 2008 the group had captured baidoa but not mogadishu by january 2009 al-shabaab and other militias had managed to force the ethiopian troops to retreat leaving behind an under-equipped african union peacekeeping force to assist the transitional federal governments troops due to a lack of funding and human resources an arms embargo that made it difficult to

the guban lies parallel to the gulf of aden littoral with a width of twelve kilometres in the west to as little as two kilometres in the east the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons when the rains arrive the gubans low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation this coastal strip is part of the ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion cal madow is a mountain range in the northeastern part of the country extending from several kilometres west of the city of bosaso to the northwest of erigavo it features somalias highest peak shimbiris which sits at an elevation of about 2416 metres 7927ft the rugged east-west ranges of the karkaar mountains also lie to the interior of the gulf of aden littoral in the central regions the countrys northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the ogo the ogos western plateau in turn gradually merges into the haud an important grazing area for livestock somalia has only two permanent rivers the jubba and shabele both of which begin in the ethiopian highlands these rivers mainly flow southwards with the jubba river entering the indian ocean at kismayo the shabele river at one time apparently used to enter the sea near merca but now reaches a point just southwest of mogadishu after that it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain east of jilib near the jubba river environment somalia is a semi-arid country with about 164 arable land the first local environmental organizations were ecoterra somalia and the somali ecological society both of which helped promote awareness about ecological concerns and mobilized environmental programs in all governmental sectors as well as in civil society from 1971 onwards a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by the siad barre government to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind-driven sand dunes that threatened to engulf towns roads and farm land by 1988 265 hectares of a projected 336 hectares had been treated with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established in 1986 the wildlife rescue research and monitoring centre was established by ecoterra intl with the goal of sensitizing the public to ecological issues this educational effort led in 1989 to the so-called somalia proposal and a decision by the somali government to adhere to the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites which established for the first time a worldwide ban on the trade of elephant ivory later fatima jibrell a prominent somali environmental activist mounted a successful campaign to salvage old-growth forests of acacia trees in the northeastern part of somalia these trees which can live for 500 years were being cut down to make charcoal since this so-called black gold is highly in demand in the arabian peninsula where the regions bedouin tribes believe the acacia to be sacred however while being a relatively inexpensive fuel that meets a users needs the production of charcoal often leads to deforestation and desertification as a way of addressing this problem jibrell and the horn of africa relief and development organization horn relief now adeso an organization of which she was the founder and executive director trained a group of teens to educate the public on the permanent damage that producing charcoal can create in 1999 horn relief coordinated a peace march in the northeastern puntland region of somalia to put an end to the so-called charcoal wars as a result of jibrells lobbying and education efforts the puntland government in 2000 prohibited the exportation of charcoal the government has also since enforced the ban which has reportedly led to an 80 drop in exports of the product jibrell was awarded the goldman environmental prize in 2002 for her efforts against environmental degradation and desertification in 2008 she also won the national geographic societybuffett foundation award for leadership in conservation following the massive tsunami of december 2004 there have also emerged allegations that after the outbreak of the somali civil war in the late 1980s somalias long remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste the huge waves that battered northern somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tons of nuclear and toxic waste that might have been dumped illegally in the country by foreign firms the european green party followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the european parliament in strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two european companies the italian swiss firm achair partners and an italian waste broker progresso and representatives of the then president of somalia the faction leader ali mahdi mohamed to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for 80 million then about 60 million according to reports by the united nations environment programme unep the waste has resulted in far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections mouth ulcers and bleeding abdominal haemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of hobyo and benadir on the indian ocean coast diseases consistent with radiation sickness unep adds that the current situation along the somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in somalia but also in the eastern africa sub-region climate due to somalias proximity to the equator there is not much seasonal variation in its climate hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall mean daily maximum temperatures range from 30 to 40c 86 to 104f except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt in mogadishu for instance average afternoon highs range from 28 to 32c 82 to 90f in april some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country berbera on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than 38c 100f from june through september nationally mean daily minimums usually vary from about 15 to 30c 59 to 86f the greatest range in climate occurs in northern somalia where temperatures sometimes surpass 45c 113f in july on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during december in the highlands in this region relative humidity ranges from about 40 in the mid-afternoon to 85 at night changing somewhat according to the season unlike the climates of most other countries at this

plateaus it is about 200 to 300mm 8 to 12in the northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation however receive considerably more rain with an average of 510 to 610mm 20 to 24in falling per year although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year the hinterland is typically dry and hot there are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns from december to march is the jilal the harshest dry season of the year the main rainy season referred to as the gu lasts from april to june this period is characterized by the southwest monsoons which rejuvenate the pasture land especially the central plateau and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation from july to september is the second dry season the xagaa pronounced hagaa the dayr which is the shortest rainy season lasts from october to december the tangambili periods that intervene between the two monsoons octobernovember and marchmay

it grew to become among the larger militaries on the continent the subsequent outbreak of the civil war in 1991 led to the disbandment of the somali national army in 2004 the gradual process of reconstituting the military was put in motion with the establishment of the transitional federal government tfg the somali armed forces are now overseen by the ministry of defence of the federal government of somalia formed in mid-2012 in january 2013 the somali federal government also re-opened the national intelligence service in mogadishu renaming the agency the national intelligence and security agency nisa the somaliland and puntland regional governments maintain their own security and police forces economy according to the cia and the central bank of somalia despite experiencing civil unrest somalia has maintained a healthy informal economy based mainly on livestock remittancemoney transfer companies and telecommunications due to a dearth of formal government statistics and the recent civil war it is difficult to gauge the size or growth of the economy for 1994 the cia estimated the gdp at 33 billion in 2001 it was estimated to be 41 billion by 2009 the cia estimated that the gdp had grown to 5731 billion with a projected real growth rate of 26 according to a 2007 british chambers of commerce report the private sector also grew particularly in the service sector unlike the pre-civil war period when most services and the industrial sector were government-run there has been substantial albeit unmeasured private investment in commercial activities this has been largely financed by the somali diaspora and includes trade and marketing money transfer services transportation communications fishery equipment airlines telecommunications education health construction and hotels libertarian economist peter leeson attributes this increased economic activity to the somali customary law referred to as xeer which he suggests provides a stable environment to conduct business in according to the central bank of somalia the countrys gdp per capita as of 2012 is 226 a slight reduction in real terms from 1990 about 43 of the population lives on less than 1 us dollar a day with around 24 of those found in urban areas and 54 living in rural areas somalias economy consists of both traditional and modern production with a gradual shift toward modern industrial techniques somalia has the largest population of camels in the world according to the central bank of somalia about 80 of the population are nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralists who keep goats sheep camels and cattle the nomads also gather resins and gums to supplement their income agriculture is the most important economic sector of somalia it accounts for about 65 of the gdp and employs 65 of the workforce livestock contributes about 40 to gdp and more than 50 of export earnings other principal exports include fish charcoal and bananas sugar sorghum and corn are products for the domestic market according to the central bank of somalia imports of goods total about 460 million per year surpassing aggregate imports prior to the start of the civil war in 1991 exports which total about 270 million annually have also surpassed pre-war aggregate export levels somalia has a trade deficit of about 190 million per year but this is exceeded by remittances sent by somalis in the diaspora estimated to be about 1 billion with the advantage of being located near the arabian peninsula somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge australias traditional dominance over the gulf arab livestock and meat market offering quality animals at very low prices in response gulf arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country with saudi arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the united arab emirates purchasing large farmlands somalia is also a major world supplier of frankincense and myrrh the modest industrial sector based on the processing of agricultural products accounts for 10 of somalias gdp according to the somali chamber of commerce and industry over six private airline firms also offer commercial flights to both domestic and international locations including daallo airlines jubba airways african express airways east africa 540 central air and hajara in 2008 the puntland government signed a multimillion-dollar deal with dubais lootah group a regional industrial group operating in the middle east and africa according to the agreement the first phase of the investment is worth dhs 170m and will see a set of new companies established to operate manage and build bosasos free trade zone and sea and airport facilities the bosaso airport company is slated to develop the airport complex to meet international standards including a new 3400m 11200ft runway main and auxiliary buildings taxi and apron areas and security perimeters prior to the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 the roughly 53 state-owned small medium and large manufacturing firms were foundering with the ensuing conflict destroying many of the remaining industries however primarily as a result of substantial local investment by the somali diaspora many of these small-scale plants have re-opened and newer ones have been created the latter include fish-canning and meat-processing plants in the northern regions as well as about 25 factories in the mogadishu area which manufacture pasta mineral water confections plastic bags fabric hides and skins detergent and soap aluminium foam mattresses and pillows fishing boats carry out packaging and stone processing in 2004 an 83 million coca-cola bottling plant also opened in the city with investors hailing from various constituencies in somalia foreign investment also included multinationals including general motors and dole fruit monetary and payment system the central bank of somalia is the official monetary authority of somalia in terms of financial management it is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy owing to a lack of confidence in the local currency the us dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the somali shilling dollarization notwithstanding the large issuance of the somali shilling has increasingly fuelled price hikes especially for low value transactions according to the central bank this inflationary environment is expected to come to an end as soon as the bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector although somalia has had no central monetary authority for more than 15 years between the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and the subsequent re-establishment of the central bank of somalia in 2009 the nations payment system is fairly advanced primarily due to the widespread existence of private money transfer operators mto that have acted as informal banking networks these remittance firms hawalas have become a large industry in somalia with an estimated us16 billion annually remitted to the region by somalis in the diaspora via money transfer companies most are members of the somali money transfer association somta an umbrella organization that regulates the communitys money transfer sector or its predecessor the somali financial services association sfsa the largest of the somali mtos is dahabshiil a somali-owned firm employing more than 2000 people across 144 countries with branches in london and dubai as the reconstituted central bank of somalia fully assumes its monetary policy responsibilities some of the existing money transfer companies are expected in the near future to seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks this will serve to expand the national payments system to include formal cheques which in turn is expected to reinforce the efficacy of the use of monetary policy in domestic macroeconomic management with a significant improvement in local security somali expatriates began returning to the country for investment opportunities coupled with modest foreign investment the inflow of funds have helped the somali shilling increase considerably in value by march 2014 the currency had appreciated by almost 60 against the us dollar over the previous 12 months the somali shilling was the strongest among the 175 global currencies traded by bloomberg rising close to 50 percentage points higher than the next most robust global currency over the same period the somalia stock exchange sse is the national bourse of somalia it was founded in 2012 by the somali diplomat idd mohamed ambassador extraordinary and deputy permanent representative to the united nations the sse was established to attract investment from both somali-owned firms and global companies in order to accelerate the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process in somalia energy and natural resources the world bank reports that electricity is now in large part supplied by local businesses among these domestic firms is the somali energy company which performs generation transmission and distribution of electric power in 2010 the nation produced 310 million kwh and consumed 2883 million kwh of electricity ranked 170th and 177th respectively by the cia somalia has reserves of several natural resources including uranium iron ore tin gypsum bauxite copper salt and natural gas the cia reports that there are 5663 billion cu m of proven natural gas reserves due to its proximity and geological similarity to the oil-rich gulf arab states such as yemen energy industry representatives believe that the nation contains substantial unexploited reserves of oil however the presence or extent of proven oil reserves in somalia is uncertain the cia asserts that as of 2011 there are no proven reserves of oil in the country while unctad suggests that most proven oil reserves in somalia lie off its northwestern coast in the somaliland region a survey of the horn of africa africa by the world bank and un ranked somalia second only to sudan as the top prospective producer an oil group listed in sydney range resources estimates that the puntland region in the northeast has the potential to produce 5 billion barrels 79010 m to 10 billion barrels 1610 m of oil compared to the 67 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in sudan as a result of these developments the somalia petroleum corporation was established by the federal government in the late 1960s un geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in somalia the find was the largest of its kind with industry experts estimating that the amount of the deposits could amount to over 25 of the worlds then known uranium reserves of 800000 tons in 1984 the iurep orientation phase mission to somalia reported that the country had 5000 tons of uranium reasonably assured resources rar 11000 tons of uranium estimated additional resources ear in calcrete deposits as well as 0150000 tons of uranium speculative resources sr in sandstone and calcrete deposits somalia evolved into a major world supplier of uranium with american uae italian and brazilian mineral companies vying for extraction rights link natural resources has a stake in the central region and kilimanjaro capital has a stake in the 1161400 acres 470002ha amsas-coriole-afgoi aca block which includes uranium exploration the trans-national industrial electricity and gas company is an energy conglomerate based in mogadishu it unites five major somali companies from the trade finance security and telecommunications sectors following a 2010 joint agreement signed in istanbul to provide electricity and gas infrastructure in somalia with an initial investment budget of 1 billion the company launched the somalia peace dividend project a labour-intensive energy program aimed at facilitating local industrialization initiatives according to the central bank of somalia as the nation embarks on the path of reconstruction the economy is expected to not only match its pre-civil war levels but also to accelerate in growth and development due to somalias untapped natural resources telecommunications and media after the start of the civil war various new telecommunications companies began to spring up and compete to provide missing infrastructure funded by somali entrepreneurs and backed by expertise from china korea and europe these nascent telecommunications firms offer affordable mobile phone and internet services that are not available in many other parts of the continent customers can conduct money transfers such as through the popular dahabshiil and other banking activities via mobile phones as well as easily gain wireless internet access after forming partnerships with multinational corporations such as sprint itt and telenor these firms now offer the cheapest and clearest phone calls in africa these somali telecommunication companies also provide services to every city town and hamlet in somalia there are presently around 25 mainlines per 1000 persons and the local availability of telephone lines

nationlink netco telcom and somali telecom group hormuud telecom alone grosses about 40 million a year despite their rivalry several of these companies signed an interconnectivity deal in 2005 that allows them to set prices maintain and expand their networks and ensure that competition does not get out of control investment in the telecom industry is held to be one of the clearest signs that somalias economy has continued to develop despite civil strife in parts of the country the sector provides key communication services and in the process facilitates job creation and income generation

centuries many of whom have significantly shaped the course of muslim learning and practice in the horn of africa the arabian peninsula and well beyond among these islamic scholars is the 14th-century
