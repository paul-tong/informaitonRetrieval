the south china sea is a marginal sea that is part of the pacific ocean encompassing an area from the karimata and malacca straits to the strait of taiwan of around 3500000 square kilometres 1400000sqmi the sea carries tremendous strategic importance one-third of the worlds shipping passes through it carrying over 3 trillion in trade each year it contains lucrative fisheries that are crucial for the food security of millions in southeast asia and huge oil and gas reserves are believed to lie beneath its seabed according to international hydrographic organization iho limits of oceans and seas 3rd edition 1953 it is located south of china east of vietnam west of the philippines east of the malay peninsula and sumatra up to the strait of singapore in the western and north of the bangka belitung islands and borneo however in its unapproved draft 4th edition 1986 iho proposed the natuna sea thus the south china sea southern boundary was shifted northward from north of the bangka belitung islands to north and northeast of natuna islands the minute south china sea islands collectively an archipelago number in the hundreds the sea and its mostly uninhabited islands are subject to competing claims of sovereignty by several countries these claims are also reflected in the variety of names used for the islands and the sea names south china sea is the dominant term used in english for the sea and the name in most european languages is equivalent this name is a result of early european interest in the sea as a route from europe and south asia to the trading opportunities of china in the sixteenth century portuguese sailors called it the china sea mare da china later needs to differentiate it from nearby bodies of water led to calling it the south china sea the international hydrographic organization refers to the sea as south china sea nan hai the yizhoushu which was a chronicle of the western zhou dynasty 1046771 bce gives the first chinese name for the south china sea as nanfang hai chinese pinyin nnfng hi literally southern sea claiming that barbarians from that sea gave tributes of hawksbill sea turtles to the zhou rulers the classic of poetry zuo zhuan and guoyu classics of the spring and autumn period 771476 bce also referred to the sea but by the name nan hai chinese pinyin nn hi literally south sea in reference to the state of chus expeditions there nan hai the south sea was one of the four seas of chinese literature there are three other seas one for each of the four cardinal directions during the eastern han dynasty 23220 ce chinas rulers called the sea zhang hai chinese pinyin zhng hi literally distended sea fei hai chinese pinyin fi hi literally boil sea became popular during the southern and northern dynasties period usage of the current chinese name nan hai south sea became gradually widespread during the qing dynasty in southeast asia it was once called the champa sea or sea of cham after the maritime kingdom of champa that flourished there before the sixteenth century the majority of the sea came under japanese naval control during world war ii following the military acquisition of many surrounding south east asian territories in 1941 japan calls the sea minami shina kai south china sea this was written until 2004 when the japanese foreign ministry and other departments switched the spelling to which has become the standard usage in japan in china it is called the south sea nnhi and in vietnam the east sea bin ng in malaysia indonesia and the philippines it was long called the south china sea dagat timog tsina in tagalog laut china selatan in malay with the part within philippine territorial waters often called the luzon sea dagat luzon by the philippines however following an escalation of the spratly islands dispute in 2011 various philippine government agencies started using the name west philippine sea a philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa spokesperson said that the sea to the east of the philippines will continue to be called the philippine sea in september 2012 philippine president benigno aquino iii signed administrative order no 29 mandating that all government agencies use the name west philippine sea to refer to the parts of the south china sea within the philippines exclusive economic zone including the luzon sea as well as the waters around within and adjacent to the kalayaan island group and bajo de masinloc and tasked the national mapping and resource information authority namria to use the name in official maps in july 2017 to assert its sovereignty indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the south china sea as the north natuna sea which is located north of the indonesian natuna islands bordering the southern vietnam exclusive economic zone corresponding to the southern end of the south china sea the natuna sea is located south of natuna island within indonesian territorial waters therefore indonesia has named two seas that are portions of the south china sea the natuna sea located between natuna islands and the lingga and tambelan archipelagos and the north natuna sea located between the natuna islands and cape c mau on the southern tip of the mekong delta in vietnam geography states and territories with borders on the sea clockwise from north include the peoples republic of china republic of china taiwan the philippines malaysia brunei indonesia singapore and vietnam major rivers that flow into the south china sea include the pearl min jiulong red mekong rajang pahang pampanga and pasig rivers extent the international hydrographic organization in its limits of oceans and seas 3rd edition 1953 defines the limits of the south china sea as follows on the south the eastern and southern limits of singapore and malacca straits a line joining tanjong datok the southeast point of johore 122n 10417e 1367n 104283e 1367 104283 through

tao turnabout island on to the south point of haitan tao 2525n and thence westward on the parallel of 2524 north to the coast of fukien on the west the mainland the southern limit of the gulf of thailand and the east coast of the malay peninsula however in a revised edition of limits of oceans and seas 4th edition 1986 the international hydrographic organization officially recognized the natuna sea thus the southern limit of south china sea is revised from the bangka belitung islands to the natuna islands geology the sea lies above a drowned continental shelf during recent ice ages global sea level was hundreds of metres lower and borneo was part of the asian mainland the south china sea opened around 45 million years ago when the dangerous ground rifted away from southern china extension culminated in seafloor spreading around 30 million years ago a process that propagated to the sw resulting in the v-shaped basin we see today extension ceased around 17 million years ago arguments have continued about the role of tectonic extrusion in forming the basin paul tapponnier and colleagues have argued that as india collides with asia it pushes indochina to the se the relative shear between indochina and china caused the south china sea to open this view is disputed by geologists who do not consider indochina to have moved far relative to mainland asia marine geophysical studies in the gulf of tonkin by peter clift has shown that the red river fault was active and causing basin formation at least by 37 million years ago in the nw south china sea consistent with extrusion playing a part in the formation of the sea since opening the south china sea has been the repository of large sediment volumes delivered by the mekong river red river and pearl river several of these deltas are rich in oil and gas deposits islands and seamounts the south china sea contains over 250 small islands atolls cays shoals reefs and sandbars most of which have no indigenous people many of which are naturally under water at high tide and some of which are permanently submerged the features are grouped into three archipelagos listed by area size macclesfield bank and scarborough shoal the spratly islands the paracel islands the pratas islands the macclesfield bank the scarborough shoal the spratly islands spread over an 810 by 900km area covering some 175 identified insular features the largest being taiping island itu aba at just over 13km long and with its highest elevation at 38 metres the largest singular feature in the area of the spratly islands is a 100km wide seamount called reed tablemount also known as reed bank in the northeast of the group separated from palawan island of the philippines by the palawan trench now completely submerged with a depth of 20 m it was an island until it sank about 7000 years ago due to the increasing sea level after the last ice age with an area of 8866km it is one of the largest submerged atoll structures in the world resources the south china sea is an extremely significant body of water in a geopolitical sense it is the second most used sea lane in the world while in terms of world annual merchant fleet tonnage over 50 passes through the strait of malacca the sunda strait and the lombok strait over 16 million m 10 million barrels of crude oil a day are shipped through the strait of malacca where there are regular reports of piracy but much less frequently than before the mid-20th century the region has proven oil reserves of around 12km 77 billion barrels with an estimate of 45km 28 billion barrels in total natural gas reserves are estimated to total around 7500km 266 trillion cubic feet a 2013 report by the us energy information administration raised the total estimated oil reserves to 11 billion barrels in 2014 china began to drill for oil in waters disputed with vietnam according to studies made by the department of environment and natural resources philippines this body of water holds one third of the entire worlds marine biodiversity thereby making it a very important area for the ecosystem however the fish stocks in the area are depleted and countries are using fishing bans as a means of asserting their sovereignty claims indonesias maritime waters have been breached by fishing fleets from vietnam and the philippines leading to said ships being seized and sunk by indonesian authorities china announced in may 2017 a breakthrough for mining methane clathrates when they extracted methane from hydrates in the south china sea territorial claims several countries have made competing territorial claims over the south china sea such disputes have been regarded as asias most potentially dangerous point of conflict both peoples republic of china prc and the republic of china roc commonly known as taiwan claim almost the entire body as their own demarcating their claims within what is known as the nine-dotted line which claims overlap with virtually every other country in the region competing claims include indonesia china and taiwan over waters ne of the natuna islands the philippines china and taiwan over scarborough shoal vietnam china and taiwan over waters west of the spratly islands some or all of the islands themselves are also disputed between vietnam china taiwan brunei malaysia and the philippines the paracel islands are disputed between the china taiwan and vietnam malaysia cambodia thailand and vietnam over areas in the gulf of thailand singapore and malaysia along the strait of johore and the strait of singapore china and vietnam have both been vigorous in prosecuting their claims china various governments and south vietnam each controlled part of the paracel islands before 1974 a brief conflict in 1974 resulted in 18 chinese and 53 vietnamese deaths and china has controlled the whole of paracel since then the spratly islands have been the site of a naval clash in which over 70 vietnamese sailors were killed just south of chigua reef in march 1988 disputing claimants regularly report clashes between naval vessels asean in general and malaysia in particular have been keen to ensure that the territorial disputes within the south china sea do not escalate into armed conflict as such joint development authorities have been set up in areas of overlapping claims to jointly develop the area and divide the profits equally without settling the issue of sovereignty over the area this is true particularly in the gulf of thailand generally china has preferred to resolve competing claims bilaterally while some asean countries prefer multilateral talks believing that they are disadvantaged in bilateral negotiations with the much larger china and that because many countries claim the same territory only multilateral talks could effectively resolve the competing claims the overlapping claims over pedra branca or pulau batu putih including the neighboring middle rocks by both singapore and malaysia were settled in 2008 by the international court of justice awarding pedra brancapulau batu puteh to singapore and the middle rocks to malaysia in july 2010 us secretary of state hillary clinton called for china to resolve the territorial dispute china responded by demanding the us keep out of the issue this came at a time when both countries had been engaging in naval exercises in a show of force to the opposing side which increased tensions in the region the us department of defense released a statement on august 18 where it opposed the use of force to resolve the dispute and accused china of assertive behaviour on july 22 2011 one of indias amphibious assault vessels the ins airavat which was on a friendly visit to vietnam was reportedly contacted at a distance of 45 nautical miles from the vietnamese coast in the disputed south china sea on an open radio channel by a vessel identifying itself as the chinese navy and stating that the ship was entering chinese waters the spokesperson for the indian navy clarified that as no ship or aircraft was visible from ins airavat it proceeded on her onward journey as scheduled the indian navy further clarified that there was no confrontation involving the ins airavat india supports freedom of navigation in international waters including in the south china sea and the right of passage in accordance with accepted principles of international law these principles should be respected by all in september 2011 shortly after china and vietnam had signed an agreement seeking to contain a dispute over the south china sea indias state-run explorer oil and natural gas corporation ongc said that its overseas investment arm ongc videsh limited had signed a three-year deal with petrovietnam for developing long-term cooperation in the oil sector and that it had accepted vietnams offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the south china sea in response chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu issued a protest the spokesman of the ministry of external affairs of the government of india responded by saying that the chinese had concerns but we are going by what the vietnamese authorities have told us and have conveyed this to the chinese the indo-vietnamese deal was also denounced by the chinese state-run newspaper global times in 1999 taiwan claimed the entirety of the south china sea islands under the lee teng-hui administration the entire subsoil seabed and waters of the paracels and spratlys are claimed by taiwan in 2012 and 2013 vietnam and taiwan butted heads against each other over anti-vietnamese military exercises by taiwan in may 2014 china established an oil rig near the paracel islands leading to multiple incidents between vietnamese and chinese ships in 2017 analysts expect the us under donald trumps administration to take a more aggressive stance against china in the south china sea 2016 ruling in january 2013 the philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against chinas claim on the territories within the nine-dash line that includes the spratly islands which it said is unlawful under the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos on july 12 2016 the arbitral tribunal backed the philippines saying that there was no evidence that china had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources hence there was no legal basis for china to claim historic rights over the nine-dash line the tribunal also criticized chinas land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the spratly islands saying that it had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment it also characterized taiping island and other features of the spratly islands as rocks under unclos and therefore are not entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone china however rejected the ruling calling it ill-founded taiwan which currently administers taiping island the largest of the spratly islands also rejected the ruling see also south china sea portal east china sea beckman robert et al eds 2013 beyond territorial disputes in the south china sea legal frameworks for the joint development of
