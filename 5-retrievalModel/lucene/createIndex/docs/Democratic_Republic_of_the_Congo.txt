populated officially francophone country the fourth-most-populated country in africa and the 16th-most-populated country in the world centred on the congo basin the territory of the drc was first inhabited by central african foragers around 90000 years ago and was reached by the bantu expansion about 3000 years ago in the west the kingdom of kongo ruled around the mouth of the congo river from the 14th to 19th centuries in the centre and east the kingdoms of luba and lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century in the 1870s just before the onset of the scramble for africa european exploration of the congo basin was carried out first led by henry morton stanley under the sponsorship of king leopold ii of belgium leopold formally acquired rights to the congo territory at the berlin conference in 1885 and made the land his private property naming it the congo free state during the free state the colonial military unit the force publique forced the local population to produce rubber and from 1885 to 1908 millions of congolese died as a consequence of disease and exploitation in 1908 belgium despite initial reluctance formally annexed the free state which became the belgian congo the belgian congo achieved independence on 30 june 1960 under the name republic of the congo congolese nationalist patrice lumumba was elected the first prime minister while joseph kasa-vubu became the first president conflict arose over the administration of the territory which became known as the congo crisis the provinces of katanga under mose tshombe and south kasai attempted to secede after lumumba turned to the soviet union for assistance in the crisis the us and belgium became wary and oversaw his removal from office by kasa-vubu on 5 september and

received considerable support from the united states due to its anti-communist stance during the cold war by the early 1990s mobutus government began to weaken destabilisation in the east resulting from the 1994 rwandan genocide and disenfranchisement among the eastern banyamulenge congolese tutsi population led to a 1996 invasion led by tutsi fpr-ruled rwanda which began the first congo war on 17 may 1997 laurent-dsir kabila a leader of tutsi forces from the province of south kivu became president after mobutu fled to morocco reverting the countrys name to the democratic republic of the congo tensions between president kabila and the rwandan and tutsi presence in the country led to the second congo war from 1998 to 2003 ultimately nine african countries and around twenty armed groups became involved in the war which resulted in the deaths of 54 million people the two wars devastated the country president laurent-dsir kabila was assassinated by one of his bodyguards on 16 january 2001 and was succeeded eight days later as president by his son joseph the democratic republic of the congo is extremely rich in natural resources but has had political instability a lack of infrastructure issues with corruption and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation with little holistic development besides the capital kinshasa the two next largest cities lubumbashi and mbuji-mayi are both mining communities dr congos largest export is raw minerals with china accepting over 50 of drcs exports in 2012 in 2016 dr congos level of human development

republic of the congo is named after the congo river which flows throughout the country the congo river is the worlds deepest river and the worlds second largest river by discharge the comit dtudes du haut congo committee for the study of the upper congo established by king leopold ii of belgium in 1876 and the international association of the congo established by him in 1879 were also named after the river the congo river itself was named by early european sailors after the kingdom of kongo and its bantu inhabitants the kongo people when they encountered them in the 16th century the word kongo comes from the kongo language also called kikongo according to american writer samuel henry nelson it is probable that the word kongo itself implies a public gathering and that it is based on the root konga to gather transitive the modern name of the kongo people bakongo was introduced in the early 20th century the democratic republic of the congo has been known in the past as in chronological order the congo free state belgian congo the republic of congo-lopoldville the democratic republic of the congo and the republic of zaire before returning to its current name the democratic republic of the congo at the time of independence the country was named the republic of congo-lopoldville to distinguish it from its neighbour the republic of the congo-brazzaville with the promulgation of the luluabourg constitution on 1 august 1964 the country became the drc but was renamed to zaire a past name for the congo river on 27 october 1971 by president mobutu sese seko as part of his authenticit initiative the word zaire is from a portuguese adaptation of a kikongo word nzere river a truncation of nzadi o nzere river swallowing rivers the river was known as zaire during the 16th and 17th centuries congo seems to have replaced zaire gradually in english usage during the 18th century and congo is the preferred english name in 19th-century literature although references to zaire as the name used by the natives ie derived from portuguese usage remained common in 1992 the sovereign national conference voted to change the name of the country to the democratic republic of the congo but the change was not made the countrys name was restored by president laurent-dsir kabila following the fall of mobutu in 1997 history early history the area now known as the drc was populated as early as 90000 years ago as shown by the 1988 discovery of the semliki harpoon at katanda one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish bantu peoples reached central africa at some point during the first millennium bc then gradually started to expand southward their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of pastoralism and of iron age techniques the people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies the development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry this led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast the final wave of the bantu expansion was complete by the 10th century followed by the establishment of the bantu kingdoms whose rising populations soon made possible intricate local regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in slaves salt iron and copper congo free state 18771908 belgian exploration and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s it was first led by sir henry morton stanley who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of king leopold ii of belgium the eastern regions of the precolonial congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding mainly from arabswahili slave traders such as the infamous tippu tip who was well known to stanley leopold had designs on what was to become the congo as a colony in a succession of negotiations leopold professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization association internationale africaine actually played one european rival against another leopold formally acquired rights to the congo territory at the conference of berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property he named it the congo free state leopolds regime began various infrastructure projects such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville now kinshasa which took eight years to complete nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which leopold and his associates could extract from the colony in the free state colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market rubber sales made a fortune for leopold who built several buildings in brussels and ostend to honor himself and his country to enforce the rubber quotas the army the force publique was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy during the period of 18851908 millions of congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease in some areas the population declined dramatically it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower congo river news of the abuses began to circulate in 1904 the british consul at boma in the congo roger casement was instructed by the british government to investigate his report called the casement report confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses the belgian parliament forced leopold ii to set up an independent commission of inquiry its findings confirmed casements report of absuses concluding that the population of the congo had been reduced by half during this period determining precisely how many people died is impossible as no accurate records exist belgian congo 190860 in 1908 the belgian parliament in spite of initial reluctance bowed to international pressure especially from the united kingdom and took over the free state from king leopold ii on 18 october 1908 the belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the congo as a belgian colony executive power went to the belgian minister of colonial affairs assisted by a colonial council conseil colonial both located in brussels the belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the belgian congo in 1926 the colonial capital moved from boma to lopoldville some 300 kilometres 190mi further upstream into the interior the transition from the congo free state to the belgian congo was a break but it also featured a large degree of continuity the last governor-general of the congo free state baron thophile wahis remained in office in the belgian congo and the majority of leopold iis administration with him opening up the congo and its natural and mineral riches to the belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion however other priorities such as healthcare and basic education slowly gained in importance colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed a system of european courts and another one of indigenous courts tribunaux indignes indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration records show that in 1936 728 belgian administrators ran the colony the belgian authorities permitted no political activity in the congo whatsoever and the force publique a locally-recruited army under belgian command put down any attempts at rebellion the belgian population of the colony increased from 1928 in 1910 to nearly 89000 in 1959 the belgian congo was directly involved in the two world wars during world war i 19141918 an initial stand-off between the force publique and the german colonial army in german east africa tanganyika turned into open warfare with a joint anglo-belgian invasion of german colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the east african campaign the force publique gained a notable victory when it marched into tabora in september 1916 under the command of general charles tombeur after heavy fighting after 1918 belgium was rewarded for the participation of the force publique in the east african campaign with a league of nations mandate over the previously german colony of ruanda-urundi during world war ii the belgian congo provided a crucial source of income for the belgian government-in-exile in london and the force publique again participated in allied campaigns in africa belgian congolese forces under the command of belgian officers notably fought against the italian colonial army in ethiopia in asosa borta and sao under major-general auguste-eduard gilliaert during the second east african campaign independence and political crisis 196065 in may 1960 a growing nationalist movement the mouvement national congolais mnc led by patrice lumumba won the parliamentary elections patrice lumumba thus became the first prime minister of the democratic republic of the congo the parliament elected as president joseph kasavubu of the alliance des bakongo abako party other parties that emerged included the parti solidaire africain psa led by antoine gizenga and the parti national du peuple pnp led by albert delvaux and laurent mbariko the belgian congo achieved independence on 30 june 1960 under the name rpublique du congo republic of congo or republic of the congo in english as the neighboring french colony of middle congo moyen congo also chose the name republic of congo upon achieving its independence the two countries were more commonly known as congo-lopoldville and congo-brazzaville after their capital cities shortly after independence the force publique mutinied and on 11 july the province of katanga led by mose tshombe and south kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership most of the 100000 europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country opening the way for congolese to replace the european military and administrative elite on 5 september 1960 kasavubu dismissed lumumba from office lumumba declared kasavubus action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed events set in motion by the us and belgium on 14 september removed lumumba from office with forces loyal to joseph mobutu on 17 january 1961 he was handed over to katangan authorities and executed by belgian-led katangese troops an investigation by the belgiums parliament in 2001 found belgium morally responsible for the murder of lumumba and the country has since officially apologised for its role in his death amidst widespread confusion and chaos a temporary government was led by technicians the collge des commissaires gnrauxfr the secession ended in january 1963 with the assistance of un forces several short-lived governments of joseph ileo cyrille adoula and moise tshombe took over in quick succession lumumba had previously appointed joseph mobutu chief of staff of the new congo army arme nationale congolaise anc taking advantage of the leadership crisis between kasavubu and tshombe mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup with financial support from the united states and belgium mobutu paid his soldiers privately the aversion of western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance mobutus quest to neutralize kasavubu and lumumba in a coup by proxy a constitutional referendum after mobutus coup of 1965 resulted in the countrys official name being changed to the democratic republic of the congo in 1971 mobutu changed the name again this time to republic of zaire mobutu and zaire 196597 the new president had the staunch support of the united states because of his opposition to communism the us believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in africa a single-party system was established and mobutu declared himself head of state he periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate although relative peace and stability were achieved mobutus government was guilty of severe human rights violations political repression a cult of personality and corruption by late 1967 mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals either through co-opting them into his regime arresting them or rendering them otherwise politically impotent throughout the late 1960s mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of office to maintain control kasa-vubus death in april 1969 ensured that no person with first republic credentials could challenge his rule by the early 1970s mobutu was attempting to assert zaire as a leading african nation he traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about african issues particularly those relating to the southern region zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller african states especially burundi chad and togo corruption became so common the term le mal zairois or zairean sickness meaning gross corruption theft and mismanagement was coined reportedly by mobutu himself international aid most often in the form of loans enriched mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960 zaire became a kleptocracy as mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds in a campaign to identify himself with african nationalism starting on 1 june 1966 mobutu renamed the nations cities lopoldville became kinshasa the country was now democratic republic of the congokinshasa stanleyville became kisangani elisabethville became lubumbashi and coquilhatville became mbandaka this renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s in 1971 mobutu renamed the country the republic of zaire its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall the congo river was renamed the zaire river during the 1970s and 1980s he was invited to visit the united states on several occasions meeting with us presidents richard nixon ronald reagan and george h w bush following the dissolution of the soviet union us relations with mobutu cooled as he was no longer deemed necessary as a cold war ally opponents within zaire stepped up demands for reform this atmosphere contributed to mobutus declaring the third republic in 1990 whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform the reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997 from 1990 to 1993 the united states facilitated mobutus attempts to hijack political change one academic wrote and also assisted the rebellion of laurent-desire kabila that overthrew the mobutu regime continental and civil wars 1996present by 1996 following the rwandan civil war and genocide and the ascension of a tutsi-led government in rwanda rwandan hutu militia forces interahamwe fled to eastern zaire and used refugee camps as a base for incursions against rwanda they allied with the zairian armed forces faz to launch a campaign against congolese ethnic tutsis in eastern zaire a coalition of rwandan and ugandan armies invaded zaire to overthrow the government of mobutu and ultimately to control the mineral resources of zaire launching the first congo war the coalition allied with some opposition figures led by laurent-dsir kabila becoming the alliance of democratic forces for the liberation of congo afdl in 1997 mobutu fled and kabila marched into kinshasa named himself president and reverted the name of the country to the democratic republic of the congo kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries he had concerns that the rwandan officers running his army were plotting to give the presidency to a tutsi who would report directly to rwandan president paul kagame rwandan troops retreated to goma and launched a new tutsi-led rebel military movement called the rassemblement congolais pour la democratie rcd to fight kabila while uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the movement for the liberation of congo mlc led by congolese warlord jean-pierre bemba the two rebel movements along with rwandan and ugandan troops started the second congo war by attacking the drc army in 1998 angolan zimbabwean and namibian militaries entered the hostilities on

number who have died from the long conflict range from 900000 to 5400000 the death toll is due to widespread disease and famine reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are

major protests broke out across the country and protesters demanded that joseph kabila step down as president the protests began after the passage of a law by the congolese lower house that if also passed by the congolese upper house would keep kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections which he is constitutionally barred from participating in this bill passed however it was gutted of the provision that would keep joseph kabila in power until a census took place a census is supposed to take place but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place in 2015 elections were scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace held in the congo on 27 november

arrested upsurge in violence according to jan egeland presently secretary general of the norwegian refugee council the situation in the drc became much worse in 2016 and 2017 and is a major moral and humanitarian challenge comparable to the wars in syria and yemen which receive much more attention women and children are abused sexually and abused in all possible manners besides the conflict in north kivu violence has gone up in the kasai region the armed groups are after gold diamonds oil and cobalt to line the pockets of rich men both in the region and internationally there are also ethnic and cultural rivalries at play as well as religious motives and the political crisis with postponed elections he says people believe the situation in the drc is stably bad but in fact it has become much much worse the big wars of the congo that were really on top of the agenda 15 years ago are back and worsening due to disruption of planting and harvesting caused by the conflict the un estimated in march 2018 that two million children risk starvation human rights watch said in 2017 that joseph kabila recruited former m23 fighters to put down country-wide protests over his refusal to step down from office at the end of his term m23 fighters patrolled the streets of congos main cities firing on or arresting protesters or anyone else deemed to be a threat to the president they said fierce

official results did not correspond to the information its election monitors had collected the government had also delayed the vote until march in some areas citing the ebola outbreak in kivu as well as the ongoing military conflict this was criticized as these regions are known as opposition strongholds geography the democratic republic of the congo drc is located in central sub-saharan africa bordered to the northwest by the republic of the congo to the north by the central african republic to the northeast by south sudan to the east by uganda rwanda and burundi and by tanzania across lake tanganyika to the south and southeast by zambia to the southwest by angola and to the west by the south atlantic ocean and the cabinda province exclave of angola the country lies between latitudes 6n and 14s and longitudes 12 and 32e it straddles the equator with one-third to the north and two-thirds to the south the size of congo 2345408 square kilometres 905567sqmi is slightly greater than the combined areas of spain france germany sweden and norway it is the second largest country in africa by area after algeria as a result of its equatorial location the drc experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world the annual rainfall can total upwards of 2000 millimetres 80in in some places and the area sustains the congo rainforest the second-largest rain forest in the world after the amazon this massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast low-lying central basin of the river which slopes toward the atlantic ocean in the west this area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest by mountainous terraces in the west and dense grasslands extending beyond the congo river in the north high glaciated mountains rwenzori mountains are found in the extreme eastern region the tropical climate also produced the congo river system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through though they are not mutually exclusive the name for the congo state is derived in part from the river the river basin meaning the congo river and all of its myriad tributaries occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly 1000000km 390000sqmi the river and its tributaries form the backbone of congolese economics and transportation major tributaries include the kasai sangha ubangi ruzizi aruwimi and lulonga the sources of the congo are in the albertine rift mountains that flank the western branch of the east african rift as well as lake tanganyika and lake mweru the river flows generally west from kisangani just below boyoma falls then gradually bends southwest passing by mbandaka joining with the ubangi river and running into the pool malebo stanley pool kinshasa and brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the pool then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons collectively known as the livingstone falls and runs past boma into the atlantic ocean the river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest watershed of any river in the world trailing the amazon in both respects the river and a 37 kilometres 23mi wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the countrys only outlet to the atlantic the albertine rift plays a key role in shaping the congos geography not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous but due to the rifts tectonic activity this area also experiences volcanic activity occasionally with loss of life the geologic activity in this area also created the african great lakes three of which lie on the congos eastern frontier lake albert known during the mobutu era as lake mobutu sese seko lake kivu unknown until late 1712 lake edward known during the amin era as lake idi amin dada and lake tanganyika lake edward and lake albert are connected by the semliki river the rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the congo making it accessible to mining cobalt copper cadmium industrial and gem-quality diamonds gold silver zinc manganese tin germanium uranium radium bauxite iron ore and coal are all found in plentiful supply especially in the congos southeastern katanga region on 17 january 2002 mount nyiragongo erupted in congo with the lava running out at 64kmh 40mph and 46m 50yd wide one of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of goma killing 45 and leaving 120000 homeless four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption the lava poisoned the water of lake kivu killing fish only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol the lava passed the airport but ruined the runway trapping several airplanes six months after the 2002 eruption nearby mount nyamuragira also erupted mount nyamuragira then erupted in 2006 and again in january 2010 world wide fund for nature ecoregions located in the congo include central congolian lowland forests home to the rare bonobo primate the eastern congolian swamp forests along the congo river the northeastern congolian lowland forests with one of the richest concentrations of primates in the world southern congolian forest-savanna mosaic a large section of the central zambezian miombo woodlands the albertine rift montane forests region of high forest runs along the eastern borders of the country world heritage sites located in democratic republic of congo are virunga national park 1979 garamba national park 1980 kahuzi-biega national park 1980 salonga national park 1984 and okapi wildlife reserve 1996 provinces the country is currently divided into the city-province of kinshasa and 25 other provinces the provinces are subdivided into districts which are divided into territories before 2015 the country had 11 provinces flora and fauna the rainforests of the democratic republic of the congo contain great biodiversity including many rare and endemic species such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo the african forest elephant the mountain gorilla the okapi and the white rhino five of the countrys national parks are listed as world heritage sites the garumba kahuzi-biega salonga and virunga national parks and the okapi wildlife reserve the democratic republic of the congo is the most biodiverse african country the civil war and resulting poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work all five sites are listed by unesco as world heritage in danger conservationists have particularly worried about primates the congo is inhabited by several great ape species the common chimpanzee pan troglodytes the bonobo pan paniscus the eastern gorilla gorilla beringei and possibly the western gorilla gorilla gorilla it is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild much concern has been raised about great ape extinction because of hunting and habitat destruction the chimpanzee the bonobo and the gorilla each of whose populations once numbered in the millions have now dwindled down to only about 200000 gorillas 100000 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10000 bonobos gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos are all classified as endangered by the world conservation union as well as the okapi which is also native to the area poaching poaching for the exotic animal or ivory trade has been a persistent problem for species loss in the drc it has been made a necessity for some trying to escape poverty and a means of continuing the civil war for some rebel groups including the lords resistance army lra the forest elephant is particularly at risk due to the high cost of its ivory especially in the far east due to this its population has reduced by 62 in 20022011 the main way this poaching for ivory can be reduced is through the hampering of the international demand for ivory as this drives the trade the introduction of park guards and the implementation of eco-tourism in virunga national park a primary habitat for great apes has allowed the endangered mountain gorilla population to jump over 1000 a 25 rise on 2010 numbers however the study indicated that poaching is still an existing problem with researchers finding 380 snares and park guards continually being ambushed and killed by poachers politics government after a four-year interlude between two constitutions with new political institutions established at the various levels of government as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the democratic republic of the congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic the 2003 transitional constitution had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature consisting of a senate and a national assembly the senate had among other things the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country the executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet headed by a president and four vice presidents the president was also the commander-in chief of the armed forces the transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary headed by a supreme court with constitutional interpretation powers the 2006 constitution also known as the constitution of the third republic came into effect in february 2006 it had concurrent authority however with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the july 2006 elections under the new constitution the legislature remained bicameral the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a president and the government led by a prime minister appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the national assembly the government not the president is responsible to the parliament the new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the governor and the head of the provincial government whom they elect the new constitution also saw the disappearance of the supreme court which was divided into three new institutions the constitutional interpretation prerogative of the supreme court is now held by the constitutional court although located in the central african un subregion the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with southern africa as a member of the southern african development community sadc corruption mobutu sese seko ruled the drc which he renamed zaire from 1965 to 1997 a relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million wed go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million he would go to the bank with mobutus authority and take out ten mobutu got one and we took the other nine mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control leading to an economic collapse in 1996 mobutu allegedly stole as much as us45 billion while in office he was not the first corrupt congolese leader by any means government as a system of organized theft goes back to king leopold ii noted adam hochschild in 2009 in july 2009 a swiss court determined that the statute of limitations had run out on an international asset recovery case of about 67 million of deposits of mobutus in a swiss bank and therefore the assets should be returned to mobutus family president joseph kabila established the commission of repression of economic crimes upon his ascension to power in 2001 human rights the international criminal court investigation in the democratic republic of the congo was initiated by joseph kabila in april 2004 the international criminal court prosecutor opened the case in june 2004 child soldiers have been used on a large scale in drc and in 2011 it was estimated that 30000 children were still operating with armed groups instances of child labor and forced labor have been observed and reported in the us department of labors findings on the worst forms of child labor in the drc in 2013 and six goods produced by the countrys mining industry appear on the departments december 2014 list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor violence against women violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal the 20132014 dhs survey pp299 found that 748 of women agreed that a husband is justified in beating his wife in certain circumstances the united nations committee on the elimination of discrimination against women in 2006 expressed concern that in the post-war transition period the promotion of womens human rights and gender equality is not seen as a priority mass rapes sexual violence and sexual slavery are used as a weapon of war by the armed forces of the democratic republic of the congo and armed groups in the eastern part of the country the eastern part of the country in particular has been described as the rape capital of the world and the prevalence of sexual violence there described as the worst in the world female genital mutilation fgm is also practiced in drc although not on a large scale the prevalence of fgm is estimated at about 5 of women fgm is illegal the law imposes a penalty of two to five years of prison and a fine of 200000 congolese francs on any person who violates the physical or functional integrity of the genital organs in july 2007 the international committee of the red cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern drc a phenomenon of pendulum displacement has developed where people hasten at night to safety according to yakin ertrk the un special rapporteur on violence against women who toured eastern congo in july 2007 violence against women in north and south kivu included unimaginable brutality ertrk added that armed groups attack local communities loot rape kidnap women and children and make them work as sexual slaves in december 2008 guardianfilms of the guardian released a film documenting the testimony of over 400 women and girls who had been abused by marauding militia in june 2010 oxfam reported a dramatic increase in the number of rapes in the democratic republic of the congo and researchers from harvard discovered that rapes committed by civilians had increased seventeenfold in june 2014 freedom from torture published reported rape and sexual violence being used routinely by state officials in congolese prisons as punishment for politically active women the women included in the report were abused in several locations across the country including the capital kinshasa and other areas away from the conflict zones in 2015 figures both inside and outside of the country such as filimbi and emmanuel weyi spoke out about the need to curb violence and instability as the 2016 elections approached foreign relations and military the global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in china india russia brazil and other developing countries require that developed countries employ new integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring on a continual basis an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs highlighting the dr congos importance to united states national security the effort to establish an elite congolese unit is the latest push by the us to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region there are economic and strategic incentives to bring more security to the congo which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt a strategic and critical metal used in many industrial and military applications the largest use of cobalt is in superalloys used to make jet engine parts cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented carbides the chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing drying agents for paints and inks ground coats for porcelain enamels decolorant for ceramics and glass and pigments for ceramics paints and plastics the country possesses 80 of the worlds cobalt reserves economy and infrastructure the central bank of the congo is responsible for developing and maintaining the congolese franc which serves as the primary form of currency in the democratic republic of the congo in 2007 the world bank decided to grant the democratic republic of congo up to 13 billion in assistance funds over the following three years kinshasa is currently negotiating membership in the organization for the harmonization of business law in africa ohada the democratic republic of congo is widely considered one of the worlds richest countries in natural resources its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of us24 trillion the congo has 70 of the worlds coltan a third of its cobalt more than 30 of its diamond reserves and a tenth of its copper despite such vast mineral wealth the economy of the democratic republic of the congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s the african country generated up to 70 of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time by 2005 90 of the drcs revenues derived from its minerals exenberger and hartmann 200710 the countrys woes mean that despite its potential its citizens are among the poorest people on earth dr congo consistently has the lowest or nearly the lowest nominal gdp per capita in the world the drc is also one of the twenty lowest-ranked countries on the corruption perception index mining the democratic republic of the congo drc is the worlds largest producer of cobalt ore and a major producer of copper and diamonds the latter come from kasai province in the west by far the largest mines in the drc are located in southern katanga province formerly shaba and are highly mechanized with a capacity of several million tons per year of copper and cobalt ore and refining capability for metal ore the drc is the second-largest diamond-producing nation in the world and artisanal and small-scale miners account for most of its production at independence in 1960 drc was the second-most industrialized country in africa after south africa it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector the first and second congo wars began in 1996 these conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue increased external debt and resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war and associated famine and disease malnutrition affects approximately two thirds of the countrys population foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict lack of infrastructure and the difficult operating environment the war intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework corruption inflation and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations conditions improved in late 2002 when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew a number of international monetary fund and world bank missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan and president joseph kabila began implementing reforms much economic activity still lies outside the gdp data a united nations human development index report shows that the human development index of drc is one of the worst the country has had in decades through 2011 the drc had the lowest human development index of the 187 ranked countries it ranked lower than niger despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country over 2010s numbers the economy of drc relies heavily on mining however the smaller-scale economic activity from artisanal mining occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in gdp data a third of the drcs diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country making it difficult to quantify diamond production levels in 2002 tin was discovered in the east of the country but to date has only been mined on a small scale smuggling of conflict minerals such as coltan and cassiterite ores of tantalum and tin respectively helped to fuel the war in the eastern congo in september 2004 state-owned gcamines signed an agreement with global enterprises corporate gec a company formed by the merger of dan gertler international dgi with beny steinmetz global to rehabilitate and operate the kananga and tilwezembe copper mines the deal was ratified by presidential decree in 2007 a world bank report reviewed dr congos three biggest mining contracts finding that the 2005 deals including one with global

tilwezembe and kananga along with the kolwesi concentrator into nikanor plc registered in the isle of man reached a market capitalization of 15 billion by 2007 in february 2007 22 of the nikanor mining company was owned by the gertner family trust and 14 by dan gertler in january 2008 katanga mining acquired nikanor for 452 million in april 2006 gertlers dgi took a major stake in dem mining a cobalt-copper mining and services company based in katanga in june 2006 gertler bought tremalt from the zimbabwean businessman john bredenkamp for about 60 million tremalt had a half share in the mukondo mine in 2007 tremalt was owned by prairie international ltd of which dan gertlers family trust was a major shareholder tremalt owned 80 of savannah mining which held concessions c17 and c18 in katanga province and 50 of the mukondo project the other 50 of mukondo was held by boss mining which in turn was 80 owned by central african mining exploration company camec boss mining had rented and operated bredenkamps half of mukondo gertler terminated this arrangement katanga mining limited a swiss-owned company owns the luilu metallurgical plant which has a capacity of 175000 tonnes of copper and 8000 tonnes of cobalt per year making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world after a major rehabilitation program the company resumed copper production operations in december 2007 and cobalt production in may 2008 in april 2013 anti-corruption ngos revealed that congolese tax authorities had failed to account for 88 million from the mining sector despite booming production and positive industrial performance the missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have paid them into the central bank later in 2013 the extractive industries transparency initiative suspended the countrys candidacy for membership due to insufficient reporting monitoring and independent audits but in july 2013 the country improved its accounting and transparency practices to the point where the eiti gave the country full membership in february 2018 global asset management firm alliancebernstein defined the drc as economically the saudi arabia of the electric vehicle age due to its cobalt resources as essential to the lithium-ion batteries that drive electric vehicles transportation ground transport in the democratic republic of congo has always been difficult the terrain and climate of the congo basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction and the distances are enormous across this vast country the drc has more navigable rivers and moves more passengers and goods by boat and ferry than any other country in africa but air transport remains the only effective means of moving goods and people between many places within the country especially in rural areas chronic economic mismanagement political corruption and internal conflicts have led to long-term under-investment of infastructure rail rail transportation is provided by the congo railroad company socit nationale des chemins de fer du congo and the office national des transports congo onatra and the office of the uele railways office des chemins de fer des ueles cfu like much of the infrastructure in the congo the railways are poorly maintained dirty crowded and dangerous road the democratic republic of the congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in africa a total of 2250km 1400mi of which only 1226km 762mi is in good condition see below to put this in perspective the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500km 1600mi eg matadi to lubumbashi 2700km 1700mi by road the figure of 2250km 1400mi converts to 35km 22mi of paved road per 1000000 of population comparative figures for zambia and botswana are 721km 448mi and 3427km 2129mi respectively three routes in the trans-african highway network pass through dr congo tripoli-cape town highway this route crosses the western extremity of the country on national road no 1 between kinshasa and matadi a distance of 285km 177mi on one of the only paved sections in fair condition lagos-mombasa highway the dr congo is the main missing link in this east-west highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function beira-lobito highway this east-west highway crosses katanga and requires re-construction over most of its length being an earth track between the angolan border and kolwezi a paved road in very poor condition between kolwezi and lubumbashi and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the zambian border water the democratic republic of congo has thousands of kilometres of navigable waterways traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around in approximately two-thirds of the country air as of june2016 dr congo had one major national airline congo airways that offered flights inside dr congo congo airways was based at kinshasas international airport all air carriers certified by the drc have been banned from european union airports by the european commission due to inadequate safety standards several international airlines service kinshasas international airport and a few also offer international flights to lubumbashi international airport energy in the democratic republic of the congo there are both coal and crude oil resources that were mainly used domestically in 2008 the democratic republic of congo has infrastructure for hydro-electricity from the congo river at the inga dams the democratic republic of congo also possesses 50 of africas forests and a river system that could provide hydro-electric power to the entire continent according to a un report on the countrys strategic significance and its potential role as an economic power in central africa the generation and distribution of electricity is controlled by socit nationale dlectricit snel but only 15 of the country has access to electricity the drc a member of three electrical power pools these are sapp southern african power pool eapp east african power pool capp central african power pool renewable energy because of abundant sunlight potential for solar development is very high in the drc there are already about 836 solar power systems in the drc with a total power of 83kw located in quateur 167 katanga 159 nord-kivu 170 the two kasa provinces 170 and bas-congo 170 also the 148 caritas network system has a total power of 631kw education in 2014 the literacy rate for the population between the ages of 15 and 49 was estimated to be 759 881 male and 638 female according to a dhs nationwide survey the education system in the democratic republic of the congo is governed by three government ministries the ministre de lenseignement primaire secondaire et professionnel mepsp the ministre de lenseignement suprieur et universitaire mesu and the ministre des affaires sociales mas primary education in the democratic republic of the congo is not free or compulsory even though the congolese constitution says it should be article 43 of the 2005 congolese constitution as a result of the 6-year civil war in the late 1990s-early 2000s over 52 million children in the country did not receive any education since the end of the civil war the situation has improved tremendously with the number of children enrolled in primary schools rising from 55 million in 2002 to 135 million in 2014 and the number of children enrolled in secondary schools rising from 28 million in 2007 to 44 million in 2014 according to unesco actual school attendance has also improved greatly in recent years with primary school net attendance estimated to be 824 in 2014 824 of children ages 611 attended school 834 for boys 806 for girls health the hospitals in the democratic republic of the congo include the general hospital of kinshasa drc has the worlds second-highest rate of infant mortality after chad in april 2011 through aid from global alliance for vaccines a new vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease was introduced around kinshasa in 2012 it was estimated that about 11 of adults aged 1549 were living with hivaids malaria is also a problem yellow fever also affects drc maternal health is poor in drc according to 2010 estimates drc has the 17th highest maternal mortality rate in the world according to unicef 435 of children under five are stunted crime and law enforcement the congolese national police pnc are the primary police force in the democratic republic of the congo demographics largest cities ethnic groups over 200 ethnic groups populate the democratic republic of the congo of which the majority are bantu peoples together mongo luba and kongo peoples bantu and mangbetu-azande peoples constitute around 45 of the population the kongo people are the largest ethnic group in the democratic republic of congo in 2016 the united nations estimated the countrys population to be 79 million people a rapid increase from 391 million in 1992 despite the ongoing war as many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named the most numerous people are the kongo luba and mongo about 600000 pygmies are the aboriginal people of the dr congo although several hundred local languages and dialects are spoken the linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of french and the national intermediary languages kituba tshiluba swahili and lingala migration given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data however evidence suggests that drc continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines in their numbers immigration is very diverse in nature refugees and asylum-seekers products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the great lakes region constitute an important subset of the population additionally the countrys large mine operations attract migrant workers from africa and beyond there is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other african countries and the rest of the world but these movements are not well studied transit migration towards south africa and europe also plays a role immigration to the drc has decreased steadily over the past two decades most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced according to the international organization for migration the number of immigrants in the drc has fallen from just over 1 million in 1960 to 754000 in 1990 to 480000 in 2005 to an estimated 445000 in 2010 official figures are unavailable partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the drc data are also lacking on irregular immigrants however given neighbouring countries ethnic links to drc nationals irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon figures for congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source from 3 to 6 million this discrepancy is due to a lack of official reliable data emigrants from the drc are above all long-term emigrants the majority of whom live in africa and to a lesser extent in europe 797 and 153 respectively according to estimated 2000 data new destination countries include south africa and various points en route to europe the drc has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond these numbers peaked in 2004 when according to unhcr there were more than 460000 refugees from the drc in 2008 congolese refugees numbered 367995 in total 68 of whom were living in other african countries since 2003 more than 400000 congolese migrants have been expelled from angola religion christianity is the majority religion in the democratic republic of the congo the most recent survey conducted by the demographic and health surveys program in 2013-2014 indicated that christians constituted 937 of the population with catholics making up 297 protestants 268 and other christians 372 an indigenous religion kimbanguism has the adherence of only 28 while muslims make up 12 other recent estimates have found christianity the majority religion followed by 958 of the population according to a 2010 pew research center estimate while the cia world factbook reports this figure to be 80 and pew research center 2013 data the proportion of followers of islam is variously estimated from 1 to 10 depending on the source and followers of indigenous beliefs similarly estimated to range from about 310 there are about 35 million catholics in the country with six archdioceses and 41 dioceses the impact of the catholic church in the democratic republic of congo is difficult to overestimate schatzberg has called it the countrys only truly national institution apart from the state its schools have educated over 60 of the nations primary school students and more than 40 of its secondary students the church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals schools and clinics as well as many diocesan economic enterprises including farms ranches stores and artisans shops kimbanguism was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the belgians kimbanguism officially the church of christ on earth by the prophet simon kimbangu now has about three million members primarily among the bakongo of bas-congo and kinshasa sixty-two protestant denominations are federated under the umbrella of the church of christ in congo it is often simply referred to as the protestant church since it covers most of the drc protestants with more than 25 million members it constitutes one of the largest protestant bodies in the world according to the pew forum islam is the faith of 12 of the population according to the cia world factbook muslims make up 10 of the population islam was introduced and mainly spread by tradersmerchantsslave raiders congolose muslims are divided into sunnis 50 shias 10 ahmadis 6 and non-denominational muslims 14 in 2013 the allied democratic forces a group linked to al-qaeda began carrying out attacks in congo which killed civilians mostly christians the first members of the bahai faith to live in the country came from uganda in 1953 four years later the first local administrative council was elected in 1970 the national spiritual assembly national administrative council was first elected though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s due to misrepresentations of foreign governments the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s in 2012 plans were announced to build a national bahai house of worship in the country traditional religions embody such concepts as monotheism animism vitalism spirit and ancestor worship witchcraft and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups the syncretic sects often merge elements of christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of christianity new variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread led by us-inspired pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderly children accused of witchcraft are sent away from homes and family often to live on the street which can lead to physical violence against these children the usual term for these children is enfants sorciers child witches or enfants dits sorciers children accused of witchcraft non-denominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for exorcisms though recently outlawed children have been subjected in these exorcisms to often-violent abuse at the hands of self-proclaimed prophets and priests languages french is the official language of the democratic republic of the congo it is culturally accepted as the lingua franca facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the congo according to a 2014 oif report 33 million congolese people 47 of the population could read and write in french in the capital city kinshasa 67 of the population could read and write french and 685 could speak and understand it approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country but only four have the status of national languages kituba kikongo ya leta lingala tshiluba and swahili although some people speak these regional or trade languages as first languages most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language lingala was the official language of the colonial army the force publique under belgian colonial rule and remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces since the recent rebellions a good part of the army in the east also uses swahili where it is prevalent when the country was a belgian colony the belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools making it one of the few african nations to have had literacy in local languages during the european colonial period this trend was reversed after independence when french became the sole language of education at all levels since 1975 the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education with french becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use french from the first year of school onward culture the culture of the democratic republic of the congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country from the mouth of the river congo on the coast upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre to the more densely populated mountains in the far east since the late 19th century traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism the struggle for independence the stagnation of the mobutu era and most recently the first and second congo wars despite these pressures the customs and cultures of the congo have retained much of their individuality the countrys 81 million inhabitants at close of 2016 are mainly rural the 30 who live in urban areas have been the most open to western influences music another feature in congo culture is its music the drc has blended its ethnic musical sources with cuban rumba and merengue to give birth to soukous other african nations produce music genres derived from congolese soukous some of the african bands sing in lingala one of the main languages in the drc the same congolese soukous under the guidance of le sapeur papa wemba have set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designer clothes they came to be known as the fourth generation of congolese music and mostly come from the former well-known band wenge musicafr sports many sports are played in the democratic republic of the congo including football basketball and rugby the sports are played in numerous stadiums throughout the country including the stade frederic kibassa maliba as zaire they have participated in the world cup football final stage in 1974 internationally the country is especially famous for its professional

literature congolese authors use literature as a way to develop a sense of national consciousness amongst the congo people the tragic history of colonialism and war lead the congolese people to settle in a place of complacency accepting the culture that was forced upon them by belgium the belgian attitude was paternalism training and treating africans as if they were children belgian parliament replaced the privately owned free state this acceptance led to a diffusion of language and many congolese people spoke and wrote in french modern congolese literature began to emerge in the late 1950s there are a few rare pieces of literature dated back to before wwi but it was not until about 1954 that literature written in french made its appearance in the congo after gaining their independence from belgium in the 1960s new authors such as guy menga and jean pierre makouta-mboukou were inspired by older authors such as jean malonga and used writing to bring attention to new issues affecting the congo the rise of female authors began in the 1970s introducing diversity to congolese literature and support for gender empowerment many authors who have contributed to the success of congolese literature are now living abroad due to economic and political issues frederick kambemba yamusangie writes literature for the between generations of those who grew up in the congo during the time when they were colonised fighting for independence and after yamusangie in an interview said he felt the distance in literature and wanted to remedy that he wrote the novel full circle which is a story of a boy named emanuel who in the beginning of the book feels a difference in culture among the different groups in the congo and elsewhere rais neza boneza an author from the katanga province of the democratic republic of congo wrote novels and poems to promote artistic expressions as a way to address and deal with conflicts born in 1907 jean molonga was a novelist and storyteller who sat in parliament from 1946 to 1951 he was noted for his original work coeur daryenne heart of aryenne consisting of controversial themes cultural identity national unity and reformation of the oppressed these authors along with others used their platforms to bring awareness to the crises and conflicts that took place in the congo environmental issues a dense tropical rainforest in the drcs central river basin and eastern highlands is bordered on the east by the albertine rift the western branch of africas great rift system it includes several of africas great lakes major environmental issues dr congos major environmental issues include deforestation poaching which threatens wildlife populations water pollution mining displaced refugees cause or are otherwise responsible for significant deforestation soil erosion and wildlife poaching another significant issue is environmental damage from mining of minerals especially diamonds gold and coltan a mineral used to manufacture capacitors species and biodiversity loss the environmental problems associated with the democratic republic of congo drc affect its many endemic species of flora and fauna the drc has the worlds second largest contiguous rain forest after the amazon as well as other ecosystems including savanna swamps and flood plains according to the world wildlife fund these unique habitats and species make the drc one of the most valuable yet vulnerable areas in the world for biodiversity wildlife protection and rainforest sustainability species loss has been cited as a problem in the drc brought about or exacerbated by reasons that include deforestation for mining wood fuel infrastructure or agriculture war illegal poaching and increased consumption of bush meat due to overpopulation and lack of food security some attempts to combat species loss in countries such as the drc are actions such as the uns sustainable development goals sdg specifically sdg 15 life on land the primary goals of which is to increase reforestation and biodiversity and reduce species loss desertification and illegal poaching one of the primary defences for species and habitat protection in the drc is its system of national parks and reserves which gives protected status to nearly 12 of the drcs rainforest five of these parks and reserves are unesco world heritage sites including africas first national park virunga national park all of these parks have been put on the world heritage in danger list poor governance and low economic conditions have reduced the effectiveness of these protections especially during war times the human cost of protecting these parks has also been high with 200 park ranger deaths in the past 20 years virunga national park and salongo national park both of which are unesco world heritage sites are currently being looked at for mining and oil exploration the move would open 215 of the virunga park for exploitation this is highly criticised by animal rights activists as it would threaten the habitat of mountain gorillas and other endangered species deforestation between 2000 and 2014 the drc lost an average of 570000 hectares 02 of rainforest to deforestation per year with the highest amount of deforestation coming between 2011 and 2014 deforestation is the primary cause of biodiversity reduction and species loss globally through habitat loss and fragmentation one of the goals of the sdg 15 is to reduce deforestation and encourage reforestation by 2020 the drc has africas largest rainforest which is under the threat of deforestation through mining operations agriculture infrastructure and wood fuel in the drc 94 of wood taken from the rainforest is used for wood fuel mainly due to poverty lack of energy infrastructure and the decentralised nature of its population to mitigate this aid agencies have tried to promote agro-forestry with fast growing trees to avoid over exploitation of the rainforests other large drivers of deforestation include mining and conflict during the congo conflict deforestation by militia groups was high for wood fuel small mining operations and illegal logging to fund their operations however conversely conflict reduced deforestation for large scale mining due to security instability one policy being attempted to reduce the deforestation and increase biodiversity in the drc is the un-redd program which uses emissions trading system so that developed nations can off set their carbon emissions by paying developing nations with rainforest to manage and conserve their forest bush meat bush meat refers to any meat which is procured from the wild as overpopulation and continual conflicts in the drc has led to food shortages this has therefore increased the use of bush meat although data on bush meat use is not extensive studies estimate 6 million tonnes of animals are taken for bush meat globally each year what animals are hunted are done so indiscriminately without thought of the importance of certain species that could be eco-system engineers or keystone species bush meat is an important source of protein for millions in the drc especially in rural areas where it makes up 50-70 of meals and for some who cannot afford farmed produce it is a free meal a recent study in the drc revealed that almost all of the animals are taken from the congo each year at 93 of all live animals there are in the forest are extracted for bush meat whereas a sustainable rate would be 20 this is a huge amount compared to the amazon where bush meat is hunted at only 3 the rate of the congo the study reveals the only way to solve this is to find other food sources to feed people in the congo basin as bush meat is their only means of eating another study showed that the species of bush meat in the meat markets of the drcs third largest city kisangani were primarily artiodactyla at 4006 of the carcasses sold then primates at 3779 of carcasses sold recently the prevalence of hunting for bush meat has declined because of the risk to hunters and butchers from the ebola virus from specifically ape and bat meat even though when the meat is cooked smoked or dried it kills the virus business has dropped significantly with some hunters reporting as much of a reduction in sales of 80 conflicts there has been a war in the drc in different levels of intensity since 1994 when the country was called zaire although what was known as africas world war had ended in 2003 the eastern part of the country still has on-going skirmishes between rebel groups and government forces no other method has reduced species population so dramatically than conflict when a militia reached the garamba national park in 1997 with in 3 months half of the parks elephants two thirds of the buffalos and three quarters of its hippos vanished the reason conflict is so damaging to wildlife is the increased use of bushmeat to feed soldiers the prevalence of weapons the lucrative industry of selling exotic animals and ivory as well as the general failure of law and order according to another study which was taken during the time of the civil war in the okapi faunal reserve there was a 50 reduction in the abundance of elephants and a vast change in the distribution of them to the more secluded areas of the park see also democratic republic of the congo portal french language and french-speaking world portal
