the moon impact probe mip developed by the indian space research organisation isro indias national space agency was a lunar probe that was released by isros chandrayaan-1 lunar remote sensing orbiter which in turn was launched on 22 october 2008 aboard a modified version of isros polar satellite launch vehicle it discovered the presence of water on the moon the moon impact probe separated from the moon-orbiting chandrayaan-1 on 14 november 2008 2006 and crashed as planned into the lunar south pole after a controlled descent the mip struck the shackleton crater at 2031 on 14 november 2008 releasing underground debris that could be analysed by the orbiter for presence of waterice with this mission india became the fourth nation to reach the lunar surface other entities to have done so are the former soviet union the united states the european space agency japan and china kalams vision the probe was a product of former president abdul kalams vision who felt that since the chandrayaan orbiter was already going so near to the moon the mission would have more scientific relevance if the probe was included he believed that the moon could not be left to a few countries and that india should not be left behind the times of india also reported a political motive by former president abdul kalam as he believed that if this was done india could always stake a claim to a portion of the moon at the same time the indian express reported kalam as saying no nation can claim the moon as its own the resources of the moon should be a common property and that is one of the aims of the moon mission mission objectives the main objectives of the mip were to demonstrate the technologies for reaching a specified location on the moon qualifying technologies required for any future soft landing missions and scientific exploration of the moon from close range just prior to the impact the probe was designed to collide with the lunar surface and eject underground soil which could then be analysed by instruments on the orbiting chandrayaan for the presence of water ice and organic and other materials configuration and payloads the mip carried three instruments radar altimeter which measured the altitude of the probe during descent and provided information on qualifying technologies for future landing missions the operating frequency band was 43 ghz 100 mhz video imaging system acquired close range images of the surface of the moon during descent and before impact the video imaging system consisted of an analog ccd camera mass spectrometer based payload chace measured trace constituents of the lunar atmosphere during descent this instrument was a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a mass resolution of 05 amu and sensitivities to partial pressures on the order of 1310 pascals the probe used aluminium sandwich structure onto which the payloads were mounted the probe attached to the mother spacecraft with a ball lock separation system which jettisoned the unit from the chandrayaan a solid propellent de-orbit mortar nudged the craft into lunar orbit while spin thrusters stabilized the orientation enabling imaging system to capture the descent profile the probes external surface had four oval-shaped anodised aluminium plates measuring 120mm x 180mm on which the image of the indian flag was depicted complete with the emblem of india and the words satyameva jayate these plates were attached to each one of the four vertical sides of the probe as per isro specifications these plates had to endure a temperature range from 50 degrees celsius and as high as more than 150 degrees celsius mission chronology india launched the chandrayaan-1 spacecraft using a modified version of the pslv c11 on 22 october 2008 from satish dhawan space centre sriharikota andhra pradesh at 0622 ist 0052utc the lunar probe separated from chandrayaaan-1 in a 102km circular polar orbit around the moon at 2006 ist on 14 november 2008 after separation it first fired its spin up rockets and then its retro rocket to lower itself to an orbit intersecting the lunar surface while descending the mip continuously sent information back to the chandrayaan-1 orbiter which in turn beamed the information back to earth after a 25-minute controlled descent it struck the moon at 2031 ist 14 november 2008 at a speed of 169 kilometers per second approximately 6100kmh or 3800 miles per hour the crash destroyed the probe it crashed into shackleton crater at the lunar south pole 89s 30w 89s 30w -89 -30 at 2031 on 14 november 2008 releasing underground material that could be analyzed by the orbiter for the presence of water ice discovery of water on 25 september 2009 isro announced that the mip had discovered water on the moon just before impact this announcement was made after the discovery of water was announced on september 24 2009 by science magazine by the nasa payload moon mineralogy mapper carried on board chandrayaan-1 mip discovered water on the moon before nasas moon mineralogy mapper the announcement of this discovery was not made until nasa confirmed it this gave the answer to the millennia-old question whether there is water on or in earths moon when it led to the discovery of water in its vapour phase by the chace chandras altitudinal composition explorer payload on board the moon impact probe mip and complementarily in its solid phase by the moon mineralogy mapper m3 payload on board the main orbiter in the chandrayaan i mission this discovery-class-of-finding by chace was achieved by direct in situ measurement of the lunar atmosphere during the descend journey of the mip to the lunar south pole while m3 discovered water in ice form by remote sensing techniques as water cannot retain its liquid phase in the lunar environment because of its own vapour pressure and the ultra-high vacuum prevailing there it can be found in solid ice and gaseous vapour phases while the moon mineralogy mapper m3 a payload by nasa on board chandrayaan i lunar orbiter has detected by mapping almost 97 of the lunar surface using remote sensing techniques the presence of water in ice form in higher latitudes especially in the polar caps the chace payload in the lunar impactor mip has directly detected water in its gaseous form along 14 degree e meridian from 45 degree n to 90 degree s latitude with a latitudinal resolution of around 010 and altitudinal resolution of 250 m from 98km altitude till impact see also moon portal spaceflight portal chandrayaan-1 exploration of the moon lcross list of current and future lunar
