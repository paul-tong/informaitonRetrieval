an infrared telescope is a telescope that uses infrared light to detect celestial bodies infrared light is one of several types of radiation present in the electromagnetic spectrum leading discoveries there were several key developments that led to the invention of the infrared telescope in 1800 william herschel discovered infrared radiation in 1878 samuel pierpoint langley created the first bolometer this was a very sensitive instrument that could electrically detect incredibly small changes in temperature in the infrared spectrum thomas edison used an alternative technology his tasimeter to measure heat in the suns corona during the solar eclipse of july 29 1878 in the 1950s scientists used lead-sulfide detectors to detect the infrared radiation from space these detectors were cooled with liquid nitrogen between 1959 and 1961 harold johnson created near-infrared photometers which allowed scientists to measure thousands of stars in 1961 frank low invented the first germanium bolometer this invention cooled by liquid helium led the way for current infrared telescope development infrared telescopes may be ground-based air-borne or space telescopes they contain an infrared camera with a special solid-state infrared detector which must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures ground-based telescopes were the first to be used to observe outer space in infrared their popularity increased in the mid-1960s ground-based telescopes have limitations because water vapor in the earths atmosphere absorbs infrared radiation ground-based infrared telescopes tend to be placed on high mountains and in very dry climates to improve visibility in the 1960s scientists used balloons to lift infrared telescopes to higher altitudes with balloons they were able to reach about 25 miles 40 kilometres up in 1967 infrared telescopes were placed on rockets these were the first air-borne infrared telescopes a more recent air-borne infrared telescope to reach the stratosphere was nasas stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy sofia in may 2010 together united states scientists and the german aerospace center scientists placed a 17-ton infrared telescope on a boeing 747 jet airplane placing infrared telescopes in space completely eliminates the interference from the earths atmosphere one of the most significant infrared telescope projects was the infrared astronomical satellite iras that launched in 1983 it revealed information about other galaxies as well as information about the center of our galaxy the milky way nasa presently has solar-powered spacecraft in space with an infrared telescope called the wide-field infrared survey explorer wise it was launched on december 14 2009 selective comparison visible light is about 04m to 07m and 075m to 1000m 1mm is a typical range for infrared astronomy far-infrared astronomy to submillimetre astronomy infrared telescopes infrared telescope facility 1979 gornergrat infrared telescope 19792005 infrared optical telescope array 19882006 united kingdom infrared telescope 1979 spitzer space telescope 2003 herschel space observatory 2009-2013 wide-field infrared survey explorer wise 2009- wide field infrared survey telescope wfirst james webb space telescope see also infrared astronomy list of largest infrared telescopes list of telescope types notes
