west-coast country of south-central africa it is the seventh-largest country in africa bordered by namibia to the south the democratic republic of the congo to the north zambia to the east and the atlantic ocean to the west angola has an exclave province the province of cabinda that borders the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo the capital and largest city of angola is luanda although inhabited since the paleolithic era what is now angola was molded by portuguese colonisation it began with and was for centuries limited to coastal settlements and trading posts established starting in the 16th century in the 19th century european settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior the portuguese colony that became angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the cuamato the kwanyama and the mbunda after a protracted anti-colonial struggle independence was achieved in 1975 as the marxistleninist peoples republic of angola a one-party state supported by the soviet union and cuba the civil war between the ruling peoples movement for the liberation of angola mpla and the insurgent anti-communist national union for the total independence of angola unita supported by the united states and apartheid south africa lasted until 2002 the sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary presidential constitutional republic angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world especially since the end of the civil war however the standard of living remains low for most of the population and life expectancy in angola is among the lowest in the world while infant mortality is among the highest angolas economic growth is highly uneven with most of the nations wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population angola is a member state of the united nations opec african union the community of portuguese language countries and the southern african development community a highly multiethnic country angolas 258 million people span tribal groups customs and traditions angolan culture reflects centuries of portuguese rule in the predominance of the portuguese language and of the catholic church etymology the name angola comes from the portuguese colonial name reino de angola kingdom of angola which appeared as early as dias de novaiss 1571 charter the toponym was derived by the portuguese from the title ngola held by the kings of ndongo ndongo in the highlands between the kwanza and lukala rivers was nominally a possession of the kingdom of kongo but was seeking greater independence in the 16th century history early migrations and political units modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators but hunter-gatherers they were displaced by bantu peoples arriving from the north most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern nigeria and southern niger bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro as well as large cattle herds to angolas central highlands and the luanda plain hendese bantu established a number of political entities the best-known of these was the kingdom of the kongo based in angola which extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo the republic of the congo and gabon it established trade routes with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade to its south lay the kingdom of ndongo from which the area of the later portuguese colony was sometimes known as dongo portuguese colonisation portuguese explorer diogo co reached the area in 1484 the previous year the portuguese had established relations with the kongo which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave paulo dias de novais founded so paulo de loanda luanda in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers benguela was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617 the portuguese established several other settlements forts and trading posts along the angolan coast principally trading in angolan slaves for brazilian plantations local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the portuguese empire usually in exchange for manufactured goods from europe this part of the atlantic slave trade continued until after brazils independence in the 1820s despite portugals territorial claims in angola its control over much of the countrys vast interior was minimal in the 16th century portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars life for european colonists was difficult and progress slow john iliffe notes that portuguese records of angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years accompanied by epidemic disease it might kill one-third or one-half of the population destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys during the portuguese restoration war the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in 1641 using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere a fleet under salvador de s retook luanda in 1648 reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650 new treaties with the kongo were signed in 1649 others with njingas kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in 1656 the conquest of pungo andongo in 1671 was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda as attempts to invade kongo in 1670 and matamba in 1681 failed colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela but until the late 19th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of angolan territory the slave trade was abolished in angola in 1836 and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves four years later a more progressive administration appointed by lisbon abolished slavery altogether however these decrees remained largely unenforceable and the portuguese depended on assistance from the british royal navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade this coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the hinterland by the mid-nineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far east as the congo river and as far south as mossmedes until the late 1880s lisbon entertained proposals to link angola with its colony in mozambique but was blocked by british and belgian opposition in this period the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola the berlin conference in 18841885 set the colonys borders delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims in angola although many details were unresolved until the 1920s trade between portugal and her african territories also rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs leading to increased development and a wave of new portuguese immigrants rise of angolan nationalism under colonial law black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions the first nationalist movements did not take root until after world war ii spearheaded by a largely westernised portuguese-speaking urban class which included many mestios during the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce portugals refusal to address increasing angolan demands for self-determination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years throughout the conflict three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the portuguese government and local forces supported to varying degrees by the portuguese communist party the national front for the liberation of angola fnla recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in lopoldville and especially from a common border with zaire angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families clans and traditions people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese sekos state employment programme some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola a largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from 1966 was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola unita it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise during the late 1950s the rise of the marxistleninist popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance formed as a coalition resistance movement by the angolan communist party the organisations leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda although both the mpla and its rivals accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the peoples republic of china the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco ghana guinea mali and the united arab republic the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to lopoldville in october 1961 renewing efforts to create a common front with the fnla then known as the union of angolan peoples upa and its leader holden roberto roberto turned down the offer when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on robertos orderssetting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war civil war throughout the war of independence the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese between 1961 and 1975 the mpla unita and the fnla competed for influence in the angolan population and the international community the soviet union and cuba became especially sympathetic towards the mpla and supplied that party with arms ammunition funding and training they also backed unita militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the mpla the collapse of portugals estado novo government following the 1974 carnation revolution suspended all portuguese military activity in africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence encouraged by the organisation of african unity holden roberto jonas savimbi and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government this was ratified by the alvor agreement later that month which called for general elections and set the countrys independence date for 11 november 1975 all three factions however followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions acquire more arms and enlarge their militant forces the rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources especially the soviet union and the united states as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties fueled a new outbreak of hostilities with tacit american and zairean support the fnla began massing large numbers of troops in northern angola in an attempt to gain military superiority meanwhile the mpla began securing control of luanda a traditional ambundu stronghold sporadic violence broke out in luanda over the next few months after the fnla attacked mpla forces in march 1975 the fighting intensified with street clashes in april and may and unita became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an mpla contingent that june an upswing in soviet arms shipments to the mpla influenced a decision by the central intelligence agency to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the fnla and unita in august 1975 the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops the soviets declined offering to send advisers but no troops however cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies by independence there were over a thousand cuban soldiers in the country they were kept supplied by a massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita the fnla was largely annihilated although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces from there savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the mpla between 1975 and 1991 the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism incorporating central planning and a marxistleninist one-party state it embarked on an ambitious programme of nationalisation and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as unidades economicas estatais uee under the mpla angola experienced a significant degree of modern industrialisation however corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment the ruling party survived an attempted coup dtat by the maoist-oriented communist organisation of angola oca in 1977 which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of oca supporters dead the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 and declared social democracy to be its new platform angola subsequently became a member of the international monetary fund restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment by may 1991 it reached a peace agreement with unita the bicesse accords which scheduled new general elections for september 1992 when the mpla secured a major electoral victory unita objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war following the election the halloween massacre occurred from 30 october to 1 november where mpla forces killed thousands of unita supporters ceasefire with unita on 22 march 2002 jonas savimbi was killed in action against government troops unita and the mpla reached a cease-fire shortly afterwards unita gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party although the political situation of the country began to stabilise regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in angola in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 all of which strengthened the prevailing dominant-party system angola has a serious humanitarian crisis the result of the prolonged war of the abundance of minefields of the continued political and to a much lesser degree military activities in favour of the independence of the exclave of cabinda carried out in the context of the protracted cabinda conflict by the flec but most of all by the depredation of the countrys rich mineral resources by the rgime while most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital in the so-called musseques the general situation for angolans remains desperate drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in southern africa in 25 years drought affected 14 million people across seven of angolas 18 provinces

namibia to the south zambia to the east the democratic republic of the congo to the north-east and the south atlantic ocean to the west the coastal exclave of cabinda in the north has borders with the republic of the congo to the north and with the democratic republic of the congo to the south angolas capital luanda lies on the atlantic coast in the northwest of the country climate angola although located in a tropical zone has a climate that is not characterized for this region due to the confluence of three factors the benguela current cold along the southern part of the coast the relief in the interior influence of the namib desert in the southwest as a result angolas climate is characterized by two seasons rainfall from october to april and drought known as cacimbo from may to august drier as the name implies and with lower temperatures on the other hand while the coastline has high rainfall rates decreasing from north to south and from 800 millimetres 31 inches to 50 millimetres 20 inches with average annual temperatures above 23c 73f the interior zone can be divided into three areas north with high rainfall and high temperatures central plateau with a dry season and average temperatures of the order of 19c south with very high thermal amplitudes due to the proximity of the kalahari desert and the influence of masses of tropical air politics the angolan government is composed of three branches of government executive legislative and judicial the executive branch of the government is composed of the president the vice-presidents and the council of ministers the legislative branch comprises a 220-seat unicameral legislature elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies for decades political power has been concentrated in the presidency the constitution of 2010 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens the legal system is based on portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities a supreme court serves as the appellate tribunal a constitutional court does not hold the powers of judicial review governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president after the end of the civil war the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character angola is classified as not free by freedom house in the freedom in the world 2014 report the report noted that the august 2012 parliamentary elections in which the ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola won more than 70 of the vote suffered from serious flaws including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls voter turnout dropped from 80 in 2008 to 60 angola scored poorly on the 2013 ibrahim index of african governance it was ranked 39 out of 52 sub-saharan african countries scoring particularly badly in the areas of participation and human rights sustainable economic opportunity and human development the ibrahim index uses a number of variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in africa the new constitution adopted in 2010 did away with presidential elections introducing a system in which the president and the vice-president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president directly or indirectly the president controls all other organs of the state so there is de facto no separation of powers in the classifications used in constitutional law this government falls under the category of authoritarian regime on 16 october 2014 angola was

dos santos stepped down from mpla leadership the leader of the winning party at the parliamentary elections in august 2017 would become the next president of angola the mpla selected defense minister

the national police ambrsio de lemos and the head of the intelligence service apolinrio jos pereira both are considered allies of former president dos santos he also removed isabel dos santos daughter

the country by a strip some 60 kilometres 37mi wide of the democratic republic of congo along the lower congo river cabinda borders the congo republic to the north and north-northeast and the drc to the east and south the town of cabinda is the chief population centre according to a 1995 census cabinda had an estimated population of 600000 approximately 400000 of whom live in neighbouring countries population estimates are however highly unreliable consisting largely of tropical forest cabinda produces hardwoods coffee cocoa crude rubber and palm oil the product for which it is best known however is its oil which has given it the nickname the kuwait of africa cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of angolas output most of the oil along its coast was discovered under portuguese rule by the cabinda gulf oil company cabgoc from 1968 onwards ever since portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of angola to the local independence groups mpla unita and fnla the territory of cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the government of angola which has employed

cabinda under the presidency of nzita henriques tiago one of the characteristics of the cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation into smaller and smaller factions economy angola has diamonds oil gold copper and a rich wildlife dramatically impoverished during the civil war forest and fossil fuels since independence oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource smallholder and plantation agriculture dramatically dropped in the angolan civil war but began to recover after 2002 the transformation industry of the late colonial period collapsed at independence because of the exodus of most of the ethnic portuguese population but it has begun to re-emerge with updated technologies partly because of an influx of new portuguese entrepreneurs similar developments have taken place in the service sector angolas economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of angolan civil war to become the fastest-growing economy in africa and one of the fastest-growing in the world with an average gdp growth of 20 between 2005 and 2007 in the period 200110 angola had the worlds highest annual average gdp growth at 111 in 2004 the exim bank of china approved a 2billion line of credit to angola to be used for rebuilding angolas infrastructure and to limit the influence of the international monetary fund there china is angolas biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest source of imports bilateral trade reached 2767billion in 2011 up 115 year-on-year chinas imports mainly crude oil and diamonds increased 91 to 2489billion while chinas exports to angola including mechanical and electrical products machinery parts and construction materials surged 388 the oil glut led to a local price for unleaded gasoline of 037 a gallon the economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 of angolas economy almost all of the countrys revenue and all of its dominant exports growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 14 million barrels per day 220000md in late 2005 and was expected to grow to 2 million barrels per day 320000md by 2007 control of the oil industry is consolidated in sonangol group a conglomerate owned by the angolan government in december 2006 angola was admitted as a member of opec operations in its diamond mines include partnerships between state-run endiama and mining companies such as alrosa which operate in angola the angolan economy grew 18 in 2005 26 in 2006 and 176 in 2007 due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated 03 in 2009 the security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of 4million displaced persons and a resulting large-scale increases in agriculture production although the countrys economy has grown significantly since angola achieved political stability in 2002 mainly due to fast-rising earnings in the oil sector angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence during the long years of civil war however high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stem from persistent authoritarianism neo-patrimonial practices at all levels of the political administrative military and economic structures and of a pervasive corruption the main beneficiaries are political administrative economic and military power holders who have accumulated and continue to accumulate enormous wealth secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes however almost half the population has to be considered poor with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities where by now slightly more than 50 of the people live a study carried out in 2008 by the angolan instituto nacional de estatstica found that in rural areas roughly 58 must be classified as poor according to un norms but in the urban areas only 19 and an overall rate of 37 in cities a majority of families well beyond those officially classified as poor must adopt a variety of survival strategies in urban areas social inequality is most evident and its extreme in luanda in the human development index angola constantly ranks in the bottom group according to the heritage foundation a conservative american think tank oil production from angola has increased so significantly that angola now is chinas biggest supplier of oil china has extended three multibillion dollar lines of credit to the angolan government two loans of 2 billion from china exim bank one in 2004 the second in 2007 as well as one loan in 2005 of 29 billion from china international fund ltd growing oil revenues also created opportunities for corruption according to a recent human rights watch report 32billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts in 20072010 furthermore sonangol the state-run oil company controls 51 of cabindas oil due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit received by the government and the taxes it pays the council of foreign affairs states that the world bank mentioned that sonangol is a taxpayer it carries out quasi-fiscal activities it invests public funds and as concessionaire it is a sector regulator this multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state before independence in 1975 angola was a breadbasket of southern africa and a major exporter of bananas coffee and sisal but three decades of civil war 19752002 destroyed fertile countryside left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities the country now depends on expensive food imports mainly from south africa and portugal while more than 90 of farming is done at the family and subsistence level thousands of angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty the enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the angolan economy illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression one of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad the small fringe of angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets for reasons of security and profit for the time being the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence including the family of the state president in banks as well as in the domains of energy telecommunications and mass media has become notable as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises sub-saharan africa nations are globally achieving impressive improvements in well-being according to a report by tony blairs africa governance initiative and the boston consulting group angola has upgraded critical infrastructure an investment made possible by funds from the nations development of oil resources according to this report just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war angolas standard of living has overall greatly improved life expectancy which was just 46 years in 2002 reached 51 in 2011 mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001 however at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished but on the contrary deepened in all respects with a stock of assets corresponding to 70billion kz us68billion angola is now the third largest financial market in sub-saharan africa surpassed only by nigeria and south africa according to the angolan minister of economy abrao gourgel the financial market of the country grew modestly from 2002 and now lies in third place at the level of sub-saharan africa angolas economy is expected to grow by 39 percent in 2014 said the international monetary fund imf robust growth in the non-oil economy mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production angolas financial system is maintained by the national bank of angola and managed by governor jose de lima massano according to a study on the banking sector carried out by deloitte the monetary policy led by banco nacional de angola bna the angolan national bank allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 796 in december 2013 which contributed to the sectors growth trend estimates released by angolas central bank said countrys economy should grow at an annual average rate of 5 percent over the next four years boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector on 19 december 2014 the capital market in angola started bodiva angola securities and debt stock exchange in english received the secondary public debt market and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by 2015 but the stock market should be a reality only in 2016 agriculture agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country the african economic outlook organization states that angola requires 45 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55 of the corn it needs 20 of the rice and just 5 of its required wheat in addition the world bank estimates that less than 3 percent of angolas abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited transport transport in angola

enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998 the most recent year for which data are available the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of pupils formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance there continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas

culture the substrate of angolan culture is african predominantly bantu while portuguese culture has had a significant impact specifically in terms of language and religion the diverse ethnic communities the ovimbundu ambundu bakongo chokwe mbunda and other peoples to varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits traditions and languages but in the cities where slightly more than half of the population now lives a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times in luanda since its foundation in the 16th century in this urban culture the portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant african roots are evident in music and dance and is moulding the way in which portuguese is spoken this process is well reflected in contemporary angolan literature especially in the works of angolan authors in 2014 angola resumed the national festival of angolan culture after a 25-year break the festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days with the
