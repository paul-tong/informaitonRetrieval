relativistic speed refers to speed at which relativistic effects become significant to the desired accuracy of measurement of the phenomenon being observed relativistic effects are those discrepancies between values calculated by models considering and not considering relativity related words are velocity rapidity and celerity which is proper velocity speed is a scalar being the magnitude of the velocity vector which in relativity is the four-velocity and in three-dimension euclidean space a three-velocity speed is empirically measured as average speed although current devices in common use can estimate speed over very small intervals and closely approximate instantaneous speed non-relativistic discrepancies include cosine error which occurs in speed detection devices when only one scalar component of the three-velocity is measured and the doppler effect which may affect observations of wavelength and frequency relativistic effects are highly non-linear and for everyday purposes are insignificant because the newtonian model closely approximates the relativity model in special relativity the lorentz factor is a measure of time dilation length contraction and relativistic mass increase of a moving object see also relative velocity special relativity relativistic wave equations lorentz factor relativistic jet relativistic mass relativistic plasma relativistic beaming ultrarelativistic limit
