apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the apollo space program and the third intended to land on the moon the craft was launched on april 11 1970 from the kennedy space center florida but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later crippling the service module sm upon which the command module cm had depended despite great hardship caused by limited power loss of cabin heat shortage of potable water and the critical need to make makeshift repairs to the carbon dioxide removal system the crew returned safely to earth on april 17 1970 six days after launch the flight passed the far side of the moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers 137 nautical miles above the lunar surface and 400171km 248655mi from earth a spaceflight record marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth the mission was commanded by james a lovell with john l jack swigert as command module pilot and fred w haise as lunar module pilot swigert was a late replacement for the original cm pilot ken mattingly who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to german measles the story of the apollo 13 mission has been dramatized multiple times most notably in the 1995 film apollo 13 crew prime and backup crew according to the standard crew rotation in place during the apollo program the prime crew for apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for apollo 10 with mercury and gemini veteran l gordon cooper in command that crew was composed of commander l gordon cooper jr command module pilot donn f eisele lunar module pilot edgar d mitchell deke slayton nasas director of flight crew operations never intended to rotate cooper and eisele to another mission as both were out of favor with nasa management for various reasons cooper for his lax attitude towards training and eisele for incidents aboard apollo 7 and an extra-marital affair he assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the astronaut office at the time the assignment needed to be made slayton felt cooper had no more than a very small chance of receiving the apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment which he did not despite eiseles issues with management slayton always intended to assign him to a future apollo applications program mission rather than a lunar mission but this program was eventually cut down to only the skylab component thus the original assignment slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was commander alan b shepard jr command module pilot stuart a roosa lunar module pilot edgar d mitchell for the first time ever slaytons recommendation was rejected by management who felt that shepard needed more time to train properly for a lunar flight as he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an inner ear disorder which had kept him grounded since his first mercury flight in 1961 thus lovells crew backup for the historic apollo 11 mission and therefore slated for apollo 14 was swapped with shepards crew and the original crew selection for the mission became prime crew backup crew ken mattingly was originally intended as the command module pilot seven days before launch the backup lunar module pilot charlie duke contracted rubella from one of his children this exposed both the prime and backup crews who trained together mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had rubella as a child and thus was not immune three days before launch at the insistence of the flight surgeon swigert was moved to the prime crew mattingly never contracted rubella and was assigned after the mission as command module pilot to youngs crew which later flew apollo 16 the fifth mission to land on the moon support crew vance d brand

191300 utc on april 11 an anomaly occurred when the second-stage center inboard engine shut down about two minutes early the four outboard engines and the third-stage engine burned longer to compensate and the vehicle achieved very close to the planned circular 100 nautical miles 190km parking orbit followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later the engine shutdown was determined to be caused by severe pogo oscillations measured at a strength of 68 g and a frequency of 16 hertz flexing the thrust frame by 3 inches 76mm the vehicles guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations pogo oscillations had been seen on previous titan rockets and also on the saturn v during apollo 6 but on apollo 13 they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump cavitation later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development these included addition of a helium-gas reservoir to the center engine liquid oxygen line to damp pressure oscillations an automatic cutoff as a backup and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second-stage engines the crew performed the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the cm odyssey to the lm aquarius and pulled away from the spent third stage which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the moon in range of a seismometer placed on the surface by apollo 12 they then settled in for the three-day trip to fra mauro accident approaching 56 hours into the mission apollo 13 was approximately 205000 miles 330000km from earth en route to the moon approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live tv broadcast from the spacecraft haise was in the process of closing out the lm while lovell was stowing the tv camera houston flight controllers asked swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the service module which were designed to destratify the cryogenic contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings two minutes later the astronauts heard a pretty large bang accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters the crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the lunar module communications and telemetry to earth were lost for 18 seconds until the system automatically corrected by switching the high-gain s-band antenna used for translunar communications from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode immediately after the bang swigert reported a problem which lovell repeated and clarified as a main b bus undervolt a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecrafts main electrical circuits oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero about three minutes later the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting a gas of some sort into space the number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply because the fuel cells generated the command and service modules electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water when oxygen tank 1 ran dry the remaining fuel cell finally shut down leaving the craft on the command modules limited-duration battery power and water the crew was forced to shut down the cm completely to save this for reentry and to power up the lm to use as a lifeboat this situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation but had not been considered a likely scenario without the lm the accident would certainly have been fatal crew survival and return journey the damage to the service module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible so lead flight director gene kranz ordered an abort of the mission the existing abort plans first drawn up in 1966 were evaluated the quickest was a direct abort trajectory which required using the service propulsion system sps engine to achieve a 6079-foot-per-second 1853ms delta-v although a successful sps firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time get would land the crew one day earlier at 118 hours get or 58 hours later the large delta-v was possible only if the lm were jettisoned first and since crew survival depended on the lms presence during the coast back to earth that option was out of the question an alternative would have been to burn the sps fuel to depletion then jettison the service module and make a second burn with the lm descent propulsion system dps engine it was desired to keep the service module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the command modules heat shield apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar sphere of gravitational influence at 61 hours get which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn there also was concern about the structural integrity of the service module so mission planners were instructed that the sps engine would not be used except as a last-ditch effort for these reasons kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option using the moons gravity to return the ship to earth apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission as required for the lunar landing at fra mauro therefore the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 307-second burn of the dps the descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion the closest approach to the moon pc2 burn to speed the return to earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the indian ocean to the pacific ocean a more aggressive burn could have been performed at pc2 by first jettisoning the service module returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used the 4-minute 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew flight controllers and support personnel for the safe return the developing drama was shown on television because electrical power was severely limited no more live tv broadcasts were made tv commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations low power levels made even voice communications difficult the lunar module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half not three people for four days oxygen was the least critical consumable because the lm carried enough to repressurize the lm after each surface eva unlike the command and service module csm which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct the lm was powered by silver-zinc batteries so electrical power and water used for equipment cooling as well as drinking were critical consumables to keep the lm life-support and communication systems operational until reentry the lm was powered down to the lowest levels possible in particular the lms abort guidance system was used for most of the coast back to earth instead of the primary guidance system as it used less power and water availability of lithium hydroxide lioh for removing carbon dioxide presented a serious problem the lms internal stock of lioh canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return and the remainder was stored in the descent stage out of reach the cm had an adequate supply of canisters but these were incompatible with the lm engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped cm canisters to the lms cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose nasa engineers referred to the improvised device as the mailbox another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down command module something never intended to be done in-flight flight controller john aaron with the support of grounded astronaut mattingly and many engineers and designers had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ships limited power supply and time factor this was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the lm caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as 4c 39f the unpowered cm got so cold that water began to condense on solid surfaces causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated this turned out not to be a problem partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the apollo 1 fire the last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before reentry the normal procedure was to use the service modules reaction control system rcs to pull the csm away after releasing the lm along with the command modules docking ring but this rcs was inoperative because of the power failure and the useless sm would be released before the lm to solve the problem grumman called on the engineering expertise of the university of toronto a team of six ut engineers led by senior scientist bernard etkin was formed to solve the problem within a day the team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the lunar module to the command module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to reentry the team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required using slide rules they needed an accurate calculation as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal causing the astronauts to burn up too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the lm grumman relayed their calculation to nasa and from there in turn to the astronauts who used it successfully reentry and splashdown as apollo 13 neared earth the crew first jettisoned the service module using the lms reaction control system to pull themselves a safe distance from it instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the sms rcs they photographed it for later analysis of the accidents cause it was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire sector 4 panel had been blown off according to the analysts these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment finally the crew jettisoned the lunar module aquarius using the above procedure worked out at the university of toronto leaving the command module odyssey to begin its lone reentry through the atmosphere the reentry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the command module the blackout in apollo 13s reentry lasted six minutes which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected the possibility of heat-shield damage from the o 2 tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period odyssey regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the south pacific ocean 213824s

gerald j mossinghoff office of legislative affairs nasa hqs brian duff public affairs officer manned spacecraft center activities and report the board exhaustively investigated and analyzed the history of the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the apollo 13 launch as documented in detailed records and logs they visited and consulted with engineers at the contractors sites and the kennedy space center once a theory of the cause was developed elements of it were tested including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay this test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created which blew off the outer panel exactly as happened in the flight cortright sent the final report of apollo 13 review board to thomas paine on june 15 1970 the failure started in the service modules number 2 oxygen tank damaged teflon insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside oxygen tank 2 allowed the wires to short-circuit and ignite this insulation the resulting fire rapidly increased pressure beyond its 1000-pound-per-square-inch 69mpa limit and the tank dome failed filling the fuel cell bay sector 4 with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products it is also possible some combustion occurred of the mylarkapton thermal insulation material used to line the oxygen shelf compartment in this bay the resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the 13-foot 40m sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby s-band antenna mechanical shock forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells leaving them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines the shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank or caused its check or relief valve to leak causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes entirely depleting the sms oxygen supply the board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events tanks storing cryogens such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen require either venting extremely good insulation or both in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks contents the service module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain supercritical hydrogen and oxygen for years each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water the construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible the tank contained several components relevant to the accident a quantity sensor a fan to stir the tank contents for more accurate quantity measurements a heater to vaporize liquid oxygen as needed a thermostat to protect the heater a temperature sensor fill and drain valves and piping the heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the command modules 28-volt dc bus the specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly beechcraft the tank subcontractor did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage the oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the apollo 10 service module but was removed to fix a potential electromagnetic interference problem during removal the shelf was accidentally dropped about 2 inches 5cm because a retaining bolt had not been removed the tank appeared to be undamaged but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged and photographs suggested that the close-out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf the report of the apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be rather low after the tank was filled for ground testing it could not be emptied through the normal drain line to avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen lovell signed off on this procedure it should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of 27c 81f when the thermostat opened the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered the board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage this raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated 540c 1000f a chart recorder on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly but no one noticed it at the time because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the 27c 81f thermostat opening temperature the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank the gas boiled off in hours rather than days the sustained high temperatures melted the teflon insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed when the tank was refilled with oxygen it became a bomb waiting to go off during the cryo stir procedure fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted producing sparks and igniting the teflon this in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it in june 1970 the cortright report provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices it included a copy of established nasa procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank to include turning the four tank heaters and fans off pulling the two heater circuit breakers to open to remove the energy source performing a 2-minute purge or directly opening the o2 valve this procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued the mission operations report apollo 13 recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low-pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2 and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission prior to the accident the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the lunar module forward by three hours this was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium she tank in the lm descent stage which had been suspect since before launch after the abort decision the helium pressure continued to rise and mission control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture the helium tank burst disc ruptured at 10854 after the lunar flyby the expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control ptc roll nicknamed the barbecue roll while the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure it did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the cryogenic malfunctions procedures were to prevent the system failure by de-energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits corrective actions the oxygen tank was redesigned with the thermostats upgraded to handle the proper voltage the heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure the stirring fans with their unsealed motors were removed which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate this required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full all electrical wiring in the power system bay was sheathed in stainless steel and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel the fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen the spacecraft and mission control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies mission notes because apollo 13 followed the free-return trajectory its altitude over the lunar far side was approximately 100km 60mi greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining apollo lunar missions the moon was almost at apogee during the mission as it also was during the flights of apollo 10 and apollo 15 which also increased the distance from the earth the combination of the two effects ensures that apollo 13 holds the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft reaching a distance of 400171 kilometers 248655mi from earth on 721pm est april 14 1970 the a7l spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms legs lunar eva helmet assembly and the life-support backpack this came about because mission control personnel watching the video feeds of apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down the red bands were used for the remaining apollo flights the space shuttle program and in the international space station the apollo 13 mission was called a successful failure by lovell because of the successful safe return of the astronauts but the failed lunar landing it has also been termed nasas finest hour president nixon awarded the presidential medal of freedom to the crew and the apollo 13 mission operations team for their actions during the mission the cold cathode gauge experiment ccge which was part of the alsep on apollo 13 was never flown again it was a version of the cold cathode ion gauge ccig which featured on apollo 12 apollo 14 and apollo 15 the ccge was designed as a standalone version of the ccig on other missions the ccig was connected as part of the suprathermal ion detector side because of the aborted landing this experiment was never deployed other experiments included on apollo 13s alsep included the heat flow experiment hfe the passive seismic experiment pse and the charged particle lunar environment experiment cplee plaque and insignia the original lunar plaque affixed to the front landing leg of aquarius bore mattinglys name so a replacement plaque with swigerts name was carried in the cabin for lovell to place over the other after he descended the ladder he kept the plaque as a souvenir in his book lost moon later renamed apollo 13 lovell stated that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces the only other memento he possesses is a letter from charles lindbergh the apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as apollos chariot across space given lovells navy background the logo also included the mottoes ex luna scientia from the moon knowledge borrowed from the us naval academys motto ex scientia tridens from knowledge sea power the mission number appeared in roman numerals as apollo xiii the patch did not have to be modified after mattinglys replacement since it is one of only two apollo mission insigniathe other being apollo 11not to include the names of the crew it was designed by artist lumen martin winter who based it on a mural he had done for the st regis hotel in new york city the mural was later purchased by actor tom hanks who portrayed lovell in the movie apollo 13 and now is on the wall of a restaurant near chicago owned by lovells son successful experiments despite apollo 13s failure to land on the moon several experiments were conducted successfully because they were initiated before or conducted independently of the oxygen tank explosion several experiments to study electrical phenomena were conducted prior to and during the launch of apollo 13 this information was used to better understand hazards of launching in less than ideal weather conditions eleven photographs of earth were taken at precisely recorded times to study the feasibility of using geosynchronous satellites to study cloud height apollo 13s s-ivb third stage was the first to be purposely crashed into the lunar surface as an active seismic experiment which measured its impact with a seismometer left on the lunar surface

disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives only a couple of news clips and a narrators solemn voice deal with the actual problems houston weve got a problem was also the title of an episode of the bbc documentary series a life at stake broadcast in march 1978 this was an accurate if simplified reconstruction of the events lovell was approached in 1991 by journalist jeffrey kluger about collaborating on a non-fiction account of the mission the resultant book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo 13 was published in 1994 the next year in 1995 a film adaptation of the book apollo 13 was released directed by ron howard and starring tom hanks as lovell bill paxton as haise kevin bacon as swigert gary sinise as mattingly ed harris as flight director gene kranz and kathleen quinlan as marilyn lovell james lovell eugene kranz and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy given that some dramatic license was taken for example the film changes the tense of lovells famous follow-up to swigerts original words from houston weve had a problem to houston we have a problem the film was nominated for several academy awards including best picture best supporting actor harris and best supporting actress quinlan in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon co-produced by hanks and howard the mission is dramatized in the episode we interrupt this program rather than showing the incident from the crews perspective as in the apollo 13 feature film it is instead presented from an earth-bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event in 2008 an interactive theatrical show titled apollo 13 mission control premiered at bats theatre in wellington new zealand the production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline the show also featured a guest astronaut each night a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line houston weve had a problem this replacement astronaut was a nod to jack swigert who replaced ken mattingly shortly before the launch
