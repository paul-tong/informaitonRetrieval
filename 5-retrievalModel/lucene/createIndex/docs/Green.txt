green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum it is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495570 nm in subtractive color systems used in painting and color printing it is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors by far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage several minerals have a green color including the emerald which is colored green by its chromium content during post-classical and early modern europe green was the color commonly associated with wealth merchants bankers and the gentry while red was reserved for the nobility for this reason the costume of the mona lisa by leonardo da vinci and the benches in the british house of commons are green while those in the house of lords are red it also has a long historical tradition as the color of ireland and of gaelic culture it is the historic color of islam representing the lush vegetation of paradise it was the color of the banner of muhammad and is found in the flags of nearly all islamic countries in surveys made in american european and islamic countries green is the color most commonly associated with nature life health youth spring hope and envy in the european union and the united states green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health but in china and most of asia its associations are very positive as the symbol of fertility and happiness because of its association with nature it is the color of the environmental movement political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the green movement some naming themselves green parties this has led to similar campaigns in advertising as companies have sold green or environmentally friendly products green is also the traditional color of safety and permission a green light means go ahead a green card permits permanent residence in the united states etymology and linguistic definitions the word green comes from the middle english and old english word grene which like the german word grn has the same root as the words grass and grow it is from a common germanic gronja- which is also reflected in old norse grnn old high german gruoni but unattested in east germanic ultimately from a pie root ghre- to grow and root-cognate with grass and to grow the first recorded use of the word as a color term in old english dates to ca ad 700 latin with viridis also has a genuine and widely used term for green related to virere to grow and ver spring it gave rise to words in several romance languages french vert italian verde and english vert verdure etc likewise the slavic languages with zelen ancient greek also had a term for yellowish pale green chloros cf the color of chlorine cognate with verdant and the green of new growth thus the languages mentioned above germanic romance slavic greek have old terms for green which are derived from words for fresh sprouting vegetation however comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently over the past few millennia and there is no identifiable single proto-indo-european or word for green for example the slavic zelen is cognate with sanskrit hari yellow ochre golden the turkic languages also have jal green or yellowish green compared to a mongolian word for meadow languages where green and blue are one color in some languages including old chinese thai old japanese and vietnamese the same word can mean either blue or green the chinese character pronounced qng in mandarin ao in japanese and thanh in sino-vietnamese has a meaning that covers both blue and green blue and green are traditionally considered shades of in more contemporary terms they are ln in mandarin and l in mandarin respectively japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green midori which is derived from the classical japanese descriptive verb midoru to be in leaf to flourish in reference to trees and guriin which is derived from the english word green however in japan although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have the green light is described using the same word as for blue aoi because green is considered a shade of aoi similarly green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples green shiso as opposed to red apples and red shiso will be described with the word aoi vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green xanh with variants such as xanh da tri azure lit sky blue lam blue and lc green also xanh l cy lit leaf green green in modern european languages corresponds to about 520570nm but many historical and non-european languages make other choices eg using a term for the range of ca 450530nm bluegreen and another for ca 530590nm greenyellow in the comparative study of color terms in the worlds languages green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors white black red green yellow and blue or more rarely in systems with five colors white red yellow green and blackblue see distinction of green from blue these languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote green but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms much like the english adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit thus the thai word kheyw besides meaning green also means rank and smelly and holds other unpleasant associations the celtic languages had a term for bluegreengrey proto-celtic glasto- which gave rise to old irish glas green grey and to welsh glas blue this word is cognate with the ancient greek bluish green contrasting with yellowish green discussed above in modern japanese the term for green is while the old term for bluegreen blue ao now means blue but in certain contexts green is still conventionally referred to as as in blue traffic light ao shing and blue leaves aoba reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old japanese more accurately the traditional japanese color terminology grouped some shades of green with blue and others with yellow tones the persian language is traditionally lacking a blackbluegreen distinction the persian word sabz can mean green black or dark thus persian erotic poetry dark-skinned women are addressed as sabz-eh as in phrases like sabz-eh-gandom-gun literally dark wheat colored or sabz-eh-malih a dark beauty similarly in sudanese arabic dark-skinned people are described as akhar the term which in standard arabic stands unambiguously for green in nature and culture emerald green the gachala emerald from the national museum of natural history washington emerald green the gachala emerald from the national museum of

in science color vision and colorimetry in optics the perception of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495570nm the sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507nm a blue-green color while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555nm a yellow-green these are the peak locations of the rod and cone scotopic and photopic respectively luminosity functions the perception of greenness in opposition to redness forming one of the opponent mechanisms in human color vision is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength m cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength l cones light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green a green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570nm human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells of which there are three types in some cases one is missing or faulty which can cause color blindness including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness green is restful to the eye studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue in the subtractive color system used in painting and color printing green is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors on the hsv color wheel also known as the rgb color wheel the complement of green is magenta that is a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light one of the purples on a traditional color wheel based on subtractive color the complementary color to green is considered to be red in additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength 550nm this green primary is combined with an orangish-red red primary and a purplish-blue blue primary to produce any color in betweenthe rgb color model a unique green green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary lasers lasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers green laser pointers outputting at 532nm 5635 thz are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness the most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state dpss technology to create the green light an infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide ndyvo4 or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet ndyag and induces it to emit 28176 thz 1064nm this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium titanium and phosphorus ktp whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam 5635 thz in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm green other green wavelengths are also available using dpss technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers including the heliumneon laser 543nm the argon-ion laser 514nm and the krypton-ion laser 521nm and 531nm as well as liquid dye lasers green lasers have a wide variety of applications including pointing illumination surgery laser light shows spectroscopy interferometry fluorescence holography machine vision non-lethal weapons and bird control as of mid-2011 direct green laser diodes at 510nm and 500nm have become generally available although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use the efficiency of these lasers peak 3 compared to that of dpss green lasers peak 35 may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses pigments food coloring and fireworks many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries pigments in this case are minerals which reflect the color green rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities the large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all among the more notable green minerals however is the emerald which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium chromiumiii oxide cr2o3 is called chrome green also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment for many years the source of amazonites color was a mystery widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments chemically known as basic copperii carbonate verdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper brass or bronze slightly warmed into a vat of fermenting wine leaving it there for several weeks and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal the process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by pliny it was used by the romans in the murals of pompeii and in celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century ad it produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate but it had drawbacks it was unstable it could not resist dampness it did not mix well with other colors it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact and it was toxic leonardo da vinci in his treatise on painting warned artists not to use it it was widely used in miniature paintings in europe and persia in the 16th and 17th centuries its use largely ended in the late 19th century when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green viridian also called chrome green is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate was patented in 1859 it became popular with painters since unlike other synthetic greens it was stable and not toxic vincent van gogh used it along with prussian blue to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting cafe terrace at night green earth is a natural pigment used since the time of the roman empire it is composed of clay colored by iron oxide magnesium aluminum silicate or potassium large deposits were found in the south of france near nice and in italy around verona on cyprus and in bohemia the clay was crushed washed to remove impurities then powdered it was sometimes called green of verona mixtures of oxidized cobalt and zinc were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century cobalt green sometimes known as rinmans green or zinc green is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt ii oxide and zinc oxide sven rinman a swedish chemist discovered this compound in 1780 green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named pannetier in paris in about 1835 emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide it was also known as guignet green there is no

parrot colored green for camouflage in the jungle the green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spiders hemolymph and tissue fluids the green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spiders hemolymph and tissue fluids green is common in nature as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll which is involved in photosynthesis chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light red and short wavelengths of light blue much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye so light reflected by plants is enriched in green chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin the new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria animals typically use the color green as camouflage blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment green animals include especially amphibians reptiles and some fish birds and insects most fish reptiles amphibians and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment for example broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds especially invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments sometimes caused by diet this can causes their feces to look green as well other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins lychochromes and hemanovadin humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields substances that may impart a greenish hue to ones skin include biliverdin the green pigment in bile and ceruloplasmin a protein that carries copper ions in chelation the green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spiders hemolymph circulatory system fluids and tissue fluids it hunts insects in green vegetation where it is well camouflaged green eyes there is no green pigment in green eyes like the color of blue eyes it is an optical illusion its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin with the blue tone imparted by the rayleigh scattering of the reflected light green eyes are most common in northern and central europe they can also be found in southern europe west asia central asia and south asia in iceland 89 of women and 87 of men have either blue or green eye color a study of icelandic and dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men among european americans green eyes are most common among those of recent celtic and germanic ancestry about 16 in history and art prehistoric history neolithic cave paintings do not have traces of green pigments but neolithic peoples in northern europe did make a green dye for clothing made from the leaves of the birch tree it was of very poor quality more brown than green ceramics from ancient mesopotamia show people wearing vivid green costumes but it is not known how the colors were produced ancient history the gardens of ancient egypt were symbols of rebirth tomb painting of the gardens of amon at the temple of karnak from the tomb of nakh the chief

roman fresco of flora or spring from stabiae 2nd century ad in ancient egypt green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the nile for painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus egyptian artists used finely ground malachite mined in the west sinai and the eastern desert a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of king tutankhamun they also used less expensive green earth pigment or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite to dye fabrics green they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant for the ancient egyptians green had very positive associations the hieroglyph for green represented a growing papyrus sprout showing the close connection between green vegetation vigor and growth in wall paintings the ruler of the underworld osiris was typically portrayed with a green face because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth palettes of green facial makeup made with malachite were found in tombs it was worn by both the living and the dead particularly around the eyes to protect them from evil tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of scarab beetles made of malachite which would protect and give vigor to the deceased it also symbolized the sea which was called the very green in ancient greece green and blue were sometimes considered the same color and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees the philosopher democritus described two different greens cloron or pale green and prasinon or leek green aristotle considered that green was located midway between black symbolizing the earth and white symbolizing water however green was not counted among the four classic colors of greek painting red yellow black and white and is rarely found in greek art the romans had a greater appreciation for the color green it was the color of venus the goddess of gardens vegetables and vineyards the romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of pompeii herculaneum lyon vaison-la-romaine and other roman cities they also used the pigment verdigris made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine by the second century ad the romans were using green in paintings mosaics and glass and there were ten different words in latin for varieties of green postclassical history in the arnolfini portrait by jan van eyck 1434 the rich green fabric of the dress showed the wealth and status of the family in the

pigment was used to paint the bright green garments of the worshippers while the background greens were painted in green earth pigments in the middle ages and renaissance the color of clothing showed a persons social rank and profession red could only be worn by the nobility brown and gray by peasants and green by merchants bankers and the gentry and their families the mona lisa wears green in her portrait as does the bride in the arnolfini portrait by jan van eyck unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight green dyes were made out of the fern plantain buckthorn berries the juice of nettles and of leeks the digitalis plant the broom plant the leaves of the fraxinus or ash tree and the bark of the alder tree but they rapidly faded or changed color only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad and then yellow with reseda luteola also known as yellow-weed the pigments available to painters were more varied monks in monasteries used verdigris made by soaking copper in fermenting wine to color medieval manuscripts they also used finely-ground malachite which made a luminous green they used green earth colors for backgrounds during the early renaissance painters such as duccio di buoninsegna learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat then with pink which gave the faces a more realistic hue over the centuries the pink has faded making some of the faces look green modern history in the 18th and 19th century dedham vale

earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes these new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes but some contained high levels of arsenic and were eventually banned in the 18th and 19th century green was associated with the romantic movement in literature and art the french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau celebrated the virtues of nature the german poet and philosopher goethe declared that green was the most restful color suitable for decorating bedrooms painters such as john constable and jean-baptiste-camille corot depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the industrial revolution the second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions not just to imitate nature one of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the american artist james mcneil whistler who created a series of paintings called symphonies or noctures of color including symphony in gray and green the ocean between 1866 and 1872 the late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other these studies were avidly followed by artists such as vincent van gogh describing his painting the night cafe to his brother theo in 1888 van gogh wrote i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions the hall is blood red and pale yellow with a green billiard table in the center and four lamps of lemon yellow with rays of orange and green everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens in the 20th and 21st century in the 1980s green became a political symbol the color of the green party in germany and in many other european countries it symbolized the environmental movement and also a new politics of the left which rejected traditional socialism and communism see politics section below symbolism and associations safety and permission green can communicate safety to proceed as in traffic lights green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century the first traffic light using green and red gas lamps was erected in 1868 in front of the houses of parliament in london it exploded the following year injuring the policeman who operated it in 1912 the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in salt lake city utah red was chosen largely because of its high visibility and its association with danger while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should in many video games green signifies both health and completed objectives opposite red nature vivacity and life green is the color most commonly associated in europe and the us with nature vivacity and life it is the color of many environmental organizations such as greenpeace and of the green parties in europe many cities have designated a garden or park as a green space and use green trash bins and containers a green cross is commonly used to designate pharmacies in europe in china green is associated with the east with sunrise and with life and growth in thailand the color green is considered auspicious for those born on a wednesday day light green for those born at night springtime freshness and hope green is the color most commonly associated in the us and europe with springtime freshness and hope green is often used to symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality in ancient egypt the god osiris king of the underworld was depicted as green-skinned green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime hope represents the faith that things will improve after a period of difficulty like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season youth and inexperience green the color most commonly associated in europe and the us with youth it also often is used to describe anyone young inexperienced probably by the analogy to immature and unripe fruit examples include green cheese a term for a fresh unaged cheese and greenhorn an inexperienced person calm tolerance and the agreeable surveys also show that green is the color most associated with the calm the agreeable and tolerance red is associated with heat blue with cold and green with an agreeable temperature red is associated with dry blue with wet and green in the middle with dampness red is the most active color blue the most passive green in the middle is the color of neutrality and calm sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance jealousy and envy green is often associated with jealousy and envy the expression green-eyed monster was first used by william shakespeare in othello it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on shakespeare also used it in the merchant of venice speaking of green-eyed jealousy love and sexuality green today is not commonly associated in europe and the united states with love and sexuality but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base natural desires of man it was the color of the serpent in the garden of eden who caused the downfall of adam and eve however for the troubadours green was the color of growing love and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married in persian and sudanese poetry dark-skinned women called green women were considered erotic the chinese term for cuckold is to wear a green hat this was because in ancient china prostitutes were called the family of

ages the devil was usually shown as either red black or green dragons were usually green because they had the heads claws and tails of reptiles modern chinese dragons are also often green but unlike european dragons they are benevolent chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers particularly control over water rainfall hurricane and floods the dragon is also a symbol of power strength and good luck the emperor of china usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength the dragon dance is a popular feature of chinese festivals in irish folklore and english folklore the color was sometimes was associated with witchcraft and with faeries and spirits the type of irish fairy known as a leprechaun is commonly portrayed wearing a green suit though before the 20th century he was usually described as wearing a red suit in theater and film green was often connected with monsters and the inhuman the earliest films of frankenstein were in black and white but in the poster for the 1935 version the bride of frankenstein the monster had a green face actor bela lugosi wore green-hued makeup for the role of dracula in the 19271928 broadway stage production poison and sickness like other common colors green has several completely opposite associations while it is the color most associated by europeans and americans with good health it is also the color most often associated with toxicity and poison there was a solid foundation for this association in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments notably verdigris vert de schweinfurt and vert de paris were highly toxic containing copper or arsenic the intoxicating drink absinthe was known as the green fairy a green tinge in the skin is sometimes associated with nausea and sickness the expression green at the gills means appearing sick the color when combined with gold is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth in some far east cultures the color green is used as a symbol of sickness or nausea social status prosperity and the dollar the famous british fashion leader beau brummel wore a green tailcoat 1805 the famous british fashion leader beau brummel

colored green in the united states green was connected with the dollar bill since 1861 the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes also since the banknotes were thin the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency one of the more notable uses of this meaning is found in the wonderful wizard of oz the emerald city in this story is a place where everyone wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green according to the populist interpretation of the story the citys color is used by the author l frank baum to illustrate the financial system of america in his day as he lived in a time when america was debating the use of paper money versus gold on flags the flag of italy 1797 was modeled after the flag of
