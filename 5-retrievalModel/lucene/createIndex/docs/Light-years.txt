the light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances and measures about 946 trillion kilometres 946 x 10 km or 588 trillion miles 588 x 10 mi as defined by the international astronomical union iau a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one julian year 36525 days because it includes the word year the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time the light-year is most often used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications the unit most commonly used in professional astrometry is the parsec symbol pc about 326 light-years the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc definitions as defined by the iau the light-year is the product of the julian year 36525 days as opposed to the 3652425-day gregorian year and the speed of light 7008299792458000000299792458ms both of these values are included in the iau 1976 system of astronomical constants used since 1984 from this the following conversions can be derived the iau recognized abbreviation for light-year is ly although other standards like iso 80000 use ly and localized symbols are frequent such as al in french from anne-lumire and spanish from ao luz lj in german from lichtjahr etc before 1984 the tropical year not the julian year and a measured not defined speed of light were included in the iau 1964 system of astronomical constants used from 1968 to 1983 the product of simon newcombs j19000 mean tropical year of 7007315569259747000315569259747 ephemeris seconds and a speed of light of 70082997925000000002997925kms produced a light-year of 7015946053000000000946053010m rounded to the seven significant digits in the speed of light found in several modern sources was probably derived from an old source such as c w allens 1973 astrophysical quantities reference work which was updated in 2000 including the iau 1976 value cited above truncated to 10 significant digits other high-precision values are not derived from a coherent iau system a value of 7015946053620700000946053620710m found in some modern sources is the product of a mean gregorian year 3652425 days or 700731556952000000031556952s and the defined speed of light 7008299792458000000299792458ms another value 7015946052840500000946052840510m is the product of the j19000 mean tropical year and the defined speed of light abbreviations used for light years and multiples of light years are ly for one light year kly for a kilolight-year 1000 light years mly for a megalight-year 1000000 light years gly for a gigalight-year 1000000000 light years history the light-year unit appeared a few years after the first successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the sun by friedrich bessel in 1838 the star was 61 cygni and he used a 62-inch 160mm heliometer designed by joseph von fraunhofer the largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit equal to the radius of the earths orbit 701115000000000000015010km or 701114966899200000093010mi in those terms trigonometric calculations based on 61 cygnis parallax of 0314 arcseconds showed the distance to the star to be 7005660000000000000660000 astronomical units 70169900000000000009910km or 70169816998400000006110mi bessel added that light employs 103 years to traverse this distance he recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit he may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light the speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838 its value changed in 1849 fizeau and 1862 foucault it was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic the light-year unit appeared however in 1851 in a german popular astronomical article by otto ule the paradox of a distance unit name ending on year was explained by ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour wegstunde a contemporary german popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name in 1868 an english journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the germans eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations although modern astronomers often prefer to use the parsec light years are also popularly used to gauge the expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space usage of term distances expressed in light-years include those between stars in the same general area such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster galaxies themselves span from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light-years in diameter and are separated from neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters by millions of light-years distances to objects such as quasars and the sloan great wall run up into the billions of light-years related units distances between objects within a star system tend to be small fractions of a light year and are usually expressed in astronomical units however smaller units of length can similarly be formed usefully by multiplying units of time by the speed of light for example the light-second useful in astronomy telecommunications and relativistic physics is exactly 7008299792458000000299792458 metres or 700731557600000000031557600 of a light-year units such as the light-minute light-hour and light-day are sometimes used in popular science publications the light-month roughly one-twelfth of a light-year is also used occasionally for approximate measures the hayden planetarium specifies the light month more precisely as 30 days of light travel time light travels approximately one foot in a nanosecond the term light-foot is sometimes used as an informal measure of time see also 1 petametre examples of distances on the order of one
