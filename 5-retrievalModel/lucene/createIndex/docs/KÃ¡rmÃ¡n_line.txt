the krmn line or karman line is an attempt to define a boundary between earths atmosphere and outer space this is important for legal and regulatory measures aircraft and spacecraft fall under different jurisdictions and are subject to different treaties the fdration aronautique internationale fai english world air sports federation an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics defines the krmn line as the altitude of 100 kilometres 62 miles 330000 feet above earths sea level other organizations do not use this definition for instance the us air force and nasa define the limit to be 50 miles 80 kilometres above sea level for purposes of awarding personnel with outer space badges there is no international law defining the edge of space and therefore the limit of national airspace and the us is resisting regulatory movement on this front the line is named after theodore von krmn 18811963 a hungarian american engineer and physicist who was active primarily in aeronautics and astronautics he was the first person to calculate at which altitude the atmosphere becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight and arrived at 836km 519mi himself the reason is that a vehicle at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift to support itself the line is approximately at the turbopause above which atmospheric gasses are not well-mixed the mesopause atmospheric temperature minimum has been measured to vary from 85 to 100km which places the line at or near the bottom of the thermosphere krmns comments in the final chapter of his autobiography krmn addresses the issue of the edge of outer space definition an atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height but becomes progressively thinner with altitude also depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the earth are defined and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably if one were to consider the thermosphere and exosphere part of the atmosphere and not of space one might have to extend the boundary to space to at least 10000km 6200mi above sea level the krmn line thus is an arbitrary definition based on the following considerations an aircraft can only stay aloft by constantly traveling forward relative to the air rather than the ground so that the wings can generate lift the thinner the air the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up the amount of lift provided which must equal the vehicles weight in order to maintain level flight is calculated by the lift equation where lift l generated is directly proportional to the air density all other factors remaining unchanged true airspeed v must increase to compensate for less air density at higher altitudes an orbiting spacecraft only stays in the sky if the centrifugal component of its movement around the earth is enough to balance the downward pull of gravity if it goes slower the pull of gravity gradually makes its altitude decrease the required speed is called orbital velocity and it varies with the height of the orbit for the international space station or a space shuttle in low earth orbit the orbital velocity is about 27000km per hour 17000 miles per hour for an airplane flying higher and higher the increasingly thin air provides less and less lift requiring increasingly higher speed to create enough lift to hold the airplane up it eventually reaches an altitude where it must fly so fast to generate lift that it reaches orbital velocity the krmn line is the altitude where the speed necessary to aerodynamically support the airplanes full weight equals orbital velocity assuming wing loading of a typical airplane in practice supporting full weight wouldnt be necessary to maintain altitude because the curvature of the earth adds centrifugal lift as the airplane reaches orbital speed however the krmn line definition ignores this effect because orbital velocity is implicitly sufficient to maintain any altitude regardless of atmospheric density the krmn line is therefore the highest altitude at which orbital speed provides sufficient aerodynamic lift to fly in a straight line that doesnt follow the curvature of the earths surface above 100 kilometers the air density is about 12200000 the density on the surface at the krmn line the air density is such that where although the calculated altitude was not exactly 100 km krmn proposed that 100 km be the designated boundary to space because the round number is more memorable and the calculated altitude varies minutely as certain parameters are varied an international committee recommended the 100 km line to the fai and upon adoption it became widely accepted as the boundary to space for many purposes however there is still no international legal definition of the demarcation between a countrys air space and outer space another hurdle to strictly defining the boundary to space is the dynamic nature of earths atmosphere for example at an altitude of 1000km 620mi the atmospheres density can vary by a factor of five depending on the time of day time of year ap magnetic index and recent solar flux the fai uses the krmn line to define the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics aeronautics for fai purposes aerial activity including all air sports within 100 kilometers of earths surface astronautics for fai purposes activity more than 100 kilometers above earths surface interpretations of the definition the expression edge of space is often used by for instance the fai in some of their publications to refer to a region below the conventional 100km boundary to space which is often meant to include substantially lower regions as well thus certain balloon or airplane flights might be described as reaching the edge of space in such statements reaching the edge of space merely refers to going higher than average aeronautical vehicles commonly would in 1963 andrew g haley discussed the krmn line in his book space law and government in a chapter on the limits of national sovereignty he made a survey of major writers views he indicated the inherent imprecision of the line alternatives to the definition the us air force definition of an astronaut is a person who has flown higher than 50 miles 80 kilometres above mean sea level approximately the line between the mesosphere and the thermosphere nasa formerly used the fais 100-kilometer 62mi figure though this was changed in 2005 to eliminate any inconsistency between military personnel and civilians flying in the same vehicle when three veteran nasa x-15 pilots john b mckay william h dana and joseph albert walker were retroactively two posthumously awarded their astronaut wings as they had flown between 90km 56mi and 108km 67mi in the 1960s but at the time had not been recognized as astronauts the latter altitude exceeds the modern international definition of the boundary of space two recent papers jc mcdowell harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics and t gangale jsd university of nebraska-lincoln advocate that the demarcation of space should be at 80km 50mi 260000ft citing as evidence von krmns original notes and calculations which concluded the boundary should be 270000ft plus functional cultural physical technological mathematical and historical factors these findings have prompted the fai to propose holding a joint conference with the international astronautical federation iaf in 2019 to fully explore the issue another definition proposed in international law discussions defines the lower boundary of space as the lowest perigee attainable by an orbiting space vehicle but does not specify an altitude due to atmospheric drag the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150km 93mi whereas an object can maintain an elliptical orbit with perigee as low as about 130km 81mi without propulsion above altitudes of approximately 160km 100mi the sky is completely black see also exosphere
