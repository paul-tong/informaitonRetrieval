in celestial mechanics the lagrangian points lrndin also lagrange points l-points or libration points are the points near two large bodies in orbit where a smaller object will maintain its position relative to the large orbiting bodies at other locations a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies but at the lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies the centripetal force of orbital motion and for certain points the coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies there are five such points labeled l1 to l5 all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies for each given combination of two orbital bodies for instance there are five lagrangian points l1 to l5 for the sun-earth system and in a similar way there are five different langrangian points for the earth-moon system l1 l2 and l3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies l4 and l5 each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies l4 and l5 are stable which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies several planets have trojan satellites near their l4 and l5 points with respect to the sun jupiter has more than a million of these trojans artificial satellites have been placed at l1 and l2 with respect to the sun and earth and with respect to the earth and the moon the lagrangian points have been proposed for uses in space exploration history the three collinear lagrange points l1 l2 l3 were discovered by leonhard euler a few years before joseph-louis lagrange discovered the remaining two in 1772 lagrange published an essay on the three-body problem in the first chapter he considered the general three-body problem from that in the second chapter he demonstrated two special constant-pattern solutions the collinear and the equilateral for any three masses with circular orbits lagrange points the five lagrangian points are labeled and defined as follows l1 point the l1 point lies on the line defined by the two large masses m1 and m2 and between them it is the most intuitively understood of the lagrangian points the one where the gravitational attraction of m2 partially cancels m1s gravitational attraction l2 point the l2 point lies on the line through the two large masses beyond the smaller of the two here the gravitational forces of the two large masses balance the centrifugal effect on a body at l2 l3 point the l3 point lies on the line defined by the two large masses beyond the larger of the two l4 and l5 points the l4 and l5 points lie at the third corners of the two equilateral triangles in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses such that the point lies behind l5 or ahead l4 of the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass the triangular points l4 and l5 are stable equilibria provided that the ratio of m1m2 is greater than 2496 this is the case for the sunearth system the sunjupiter system and by a smaller margin the earthmoon system when a body at these points is perturbed it moves away from the point but the factor opposite of that which is increased or decreased by the perturbation either gravity or angular momentum-induced speed will also increase or decrease bending the objects path into a stable kidney bean-shaped orbit around the point as seen in the corotating frame of reference in contrast to l4 and l5 where stable equilibrium exists the points l1 l2 and l3 are positions of unstable equilibrium any object orbiting at l1 l2 or l3 will tend to fall out of orbit it is therefore rare to find natural objects there and spacecraft inhabiting these areas must employ station keeping in order to maintain their position natural objects at lagrangian points it is common to find objects at or orbiting the l4 and l5 points of natural orbital systems these are commonly called trojans in the 20th century asteroids discovered orbiting at the sunjupiter l4 and l5 points were named after characters from homers iliad asteroids at the l4 point which leads jupiter are referred to as the greek camp whereas those at the l5 point are referred to as the trojan camp other examples of natural objects orbiting at lagrange points the sunearth l4 and l5 points contain interplanetary dust and at least one asteroid 2010 tk7 detected in october 2010 by wide-field infrared survey explorer wise and announced during july 2011 the earthmoon l4 and l5 points contain interplanetary dust in what are called kordylewski clouds although the hiten spacecrafts munich dust counter mdc detected no increase in dust during its passes through these points in 1992 their presence was confirmed in 2018 by a team of hungarian astronomers and physicists stability at these specific points is greatly complicated by solar gravitational influence recent observations suggest that the sunneptune l4 and l5 points known as the neptune trojans may be very thickly populated containing large bodies an order of magnitude more numerous than the jupiter trojans several asteroids also orbit near the sun-jupiter l3 point called the hilda family the saturnian moon tethys has two smaller moons in its l4 and l5 points telesto and calypso the saturnian moon dione also has two lagrangian co-orbitals helene at its l4 point and polydeuces at l5 the moons wander azimuthally about the lagrangian points with polydeuces describing the largest deviations moving up to 32 away from the saturndione l5 point tethys and dione are hundreds of times more massive than their escorts see the moons articles for exact diameter figures masses are not known in several cases and saturn is far more massive still which makes the overall system stable one version of the giant impact hypothesis suggests that an object named theia formed at the sunearth l4 or l5 points and crashed into earth after its orbit destabilized forming the moon mars has four known co-orbital asteroids 5261 eureka 1999 uj7 1998 vf31 and 2007 ns2 all at its lagrangian points earths companion object 3753 cruithne is in a relationship with earth that is somewhat trojan-like but that is different from a true trojan cruithne occupies one of two regular solar orbits one of them slightly smaller and faster than earths and the other slightly larger and slower it periodically alternates between these two orbits due to close encounters with earth when it is in the smaller faster orbit and approaches earth it gains orbital energy from earth and moves up into the larger slower orbit it then falls farther and farther behind earth and eventually earth approaches it from the other direction then cruithne gives up orbital energy to earth and drops back into the smaller orbit thus beginning the cycle anew the cycle has no noticeable impact on the length of the year because earths mass is over 20billion 7010200000000000000210 times more than that of 3753cruithne epimetheus and janus satellites of saturn have a similar relationship though they are of similar masses and so actually exchange orbits with each other periodically janus is roughly 4times more massive but still light enough for its orbit to be altered another similar configuration is known as orbital resonance in which orbiting bodies tend to have periods of a simple integer ratio due to their interaction in a binary star system the roche lobe has its apex located at l1 if a star overflows its roche lobe then it will lose matter to its companion star mathematical details lagrangian points are the constant-pattern solutions of the restricted three-body problem for example given two massive bodies in orbits around their common barycenter there are five positions in space where a third body of comparatively negligible mass could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies as seen in a rotating reference frame that matches the angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined providing the centripetal force at the lagrangian points allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary with respect to the first two l1 the location of l1 is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force where r is the distance of the l1 point from the smaller object r is the distance between the two main objects and m1 and m2 are the masses of the large and small object respectively solving this for r involves solving a quintic function but if the mass of the smaller object m2 is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m1 then l1 and l2 are at approximately equal distances r from the smaller object equal to the radius of the hill sphere given by this distance can be described as being such that the orbital period corresponding to a circular orbit with this distance as radius around m2 in the absence of m1 is that of m2 around m1 divided by 3 173 l2 the location of l2 is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force with parameters defined as for the l1 case again if the mass of the smaller object m2 is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m1 then l2 is at approximately the radius of the hill sphere given by l3 the location of l3 is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force with parameters defined as for the l1 and l2 cases except that r now indicates how much closer l3 is to the more massive object than the smaller object if the mass of the smaller object m2 is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m1 then l4 and l5 the reason these points are in balance is that at l4 and l5 the distances to the two masses are equal accordingly the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies are in the same ratio as the masses of the two bodies and so the resultant force acts through the barycenter of the system additionally the geometry of the triangle ensures that the resultant acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same ratio as for the two massive bodies the barycenter being both the center of mass and center of rotation of the three-body system this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the lagrange point in orbital equilibrium with the other two larger bodies of system indeed the third body need not have negligible mass the general triangular configuration was discovered by lagrange in work on the three-body problem radial acceleration the radial acceleration a of an object in orbit at a point along the line passing through both bodies is given by where r is the distance from the large body m1 and sgnx is the sign function of x the terms in this function represent respectively force from m1 force from m2 and centrifugal force the points l3 l1 l2 occur where the acceleration is zero see chart at right stability although the l1 l2 and l3 points are nominally unstable there are unstable periodic orbits called halo orbits around these points in a three-body system a full n-body dynamical system such as the solar system does not contain these periodic orbits but does contain quasi-periodic ie bounded but not precisely repeating orbits following lissajous-curve trajectories these quasi-periodic lissajous orbits are what most of lagrangian-point space missions have used until now although they are not perfectly stable a modest effort of station keeping keeps a spacecraft in a desired lissajous orbit for a long time also for sunearth-l1 missions it is preferable for the spacecraft to be in a large-amplitude 100000200000km or 62000124000mi lissajous orbit around l1 than to stay at l1 because the line between sun and earth has increased solar interference on earthspacecraft communications similarly a large-amplitude lissajous orbit around l2 keeps a probe out of earths shadow and therefore ensures continuous illumination of its solar panels the l4 and l5 points are stable provided that the mass of the primary body eg the earth is at least 25 times the mass of the secondary body eg the moon the earth is over 81 times the mass of the moon the moon is 123 of the mass of the earth although the l4 and l5 points are found at the top of a hill as in the effective potential contour plot above they are nonetheless stable the reason for the stability is a second-order effect as a body moves away from the exact lagrange position coriolis acceleration which depends on the velocity of an orbiting object and cannot be modeled as a contour map curves the trajectory into a path around rather than away from the point solar system values this table lists sample values of l1 l2 and l3 within the solar system calculations assume the two bodies orbit in a perfect circle with separation equal to the semimajor axis and no other bodies are nearby distances are measured from the larger bodys center of mass with l3 showing a negative location the percentage columns show how the distances compare to the semimajor axis eg for the moon l1 is located 7008326400000000000326400km from earths center which is 849 of the earth-moon distance or 151 in front of the moon l2 is located 7008448900000000000448900km from earths center which is 1168 of the earth-moon distance or 168 beyond the moon and l3 is located 2991618300000000000381700km from earths center which is 993 of the earth-moon distance or 07084 in front of the moons negative position spaceflight applications sunearth sunearth l1 is suited for making observations of the sunearth system objects here are never shadowed by earth or the moon and if observing earth always view the sunlit hemisphere the first mission of this type was the 1978 international sun earth explorer 3 isee-3 mission used as an interplanetary early warning storm monitor for solar disturbances since june 2015 dscovr has orbited the l1 point conversely it is also useful for space-based solar telescopes because it provides an uninterrupted view of the sun and any space weather including the solar wind and coronal mass ejections reaches l1 a few hours before earth solar telescopes currently located around l1 include the solar and heliospheric observatory and advanced composition explorer sunearth l2 is a good spot for space-based observatories because an object around l2 will maintain the same relative position with respect to the sun and earth shielding and calibration are much simpler it is however slightly beyond the reach of earths umbra so solar radiation is not completely blocked at l2 real spacecraft generally orbit around l2 avoiding partial eclipses of the sun to maintain a constant temperature from locations near l2 the sun earth and moon are relatively close together in the sky this means that a large sunshade with the telescope on the dark-side can allow the telescope to cool passively to around 50 k this is especially helpful for infrared astronomy and observations of the cosmic microwave background the james webb space telescope is due to be positioned at l2 sunearth l3 was a popular place to put a counter-earth in pulp science fiction and comic books once space-based observation became possible via satellites and probes it was shown to hold no such object the sunearth l3 is unstable and could not contain a natural object large or small for very long this is because the gravitational forces of the other planets are stronger than that of earth venus for example comes within 03au of this l3 every 20months a spacecraft orbiting near sunearth l3 would be able to closely monitor the evolution of active sunspot regions before they rotate into a geoeffective position so that a 7-day early warning could be issued by the noaa space weather prediction center moreover a satellite near sunearth l3 would provide very important observations not only for earth forecasts but also for deep space support mars predictions and for manned mission to near-earth asteroids in 2010 spacecraft transfer trajectories to sunearth l3 were studied and several designs were considered missions to lagrangian points generally orbit the points rather than occupy them directly another interesting and useful property of the collinear lagrangian points and their associated lissajous orbits is that they serve as gateways to control the chaotic trajectories of the interplanetary transport network earthmoon earthmoon l1 allows comparatively easy access to lunar and earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and this has as an advantage to position a half-way manned space station intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the moon and back earthmoon l2 has been used for a communications satellite covering the moons far side for example queqiao launched in may 2018 and would be an ideal location for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture sunvenus scientists at the b612 foundation are planning to use venuss l3 point to position their planned sentinel telescope which aims to look back towards earths orbit and compile a catalogue of near-earth asteroids sunmars in 2017 nasa proposed the idea of positioning a magnetic dipole shield at the sun-mars l1 point for use as an artificial magnetosphere for mars the idea is that this would protect the planets atmosphere from the suns radiation and solar winds lagrangian spacecraft and missions spacecraft at sunearth l1 international sun earth explorer 3 isee-3 began its mission at the sunearth l1 before leaving to intercept a comet in 1982 the sunearth l1 is also the point to which the reboot isee-3 mission was attempting to return the craft as the first phase of a recovery mission as of september 25 2014 all efforts have failed and contact was lost solar and heliospheric observatory soho is stationed in a halo orbit at l1 and the advanced composition explorer ace in a lissajous orbit wind is also at l1 deep space climate observatory dscovr launched on 11 february 2015 began orbiting l1 on 8 june 2015 to study the solar wind and its effects on earth dscovr is unofficially known as goresat because it carries a camera always oriented to earth and capturing full-frame photos of the planet similar to the blue marble this concept was proposed by then-vice president of the united states al gore in 1998 and was a centerpiece in his film an inconvenient truth lisa pathfinder lpf was launched on 3 december 2015 and arrived at l1 on 22 january 2016 where among other experiments it tested the technology needed by elisa to detect gravitational waves lisa pathfinder used an instrument consisting of two small gold alloy cubes spacecraft at sunearth l2 spacecraft at the sunearth l2 point are in a lissajous orbit until decommissioned when they are sent into a heliocentric graveyard orbit 1 october 2001 october 2010 wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe november 2003 april 2004 wind then it returned to earth orbit
