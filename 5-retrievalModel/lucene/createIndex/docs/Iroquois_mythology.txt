much of the mythology of the iroquois a confederacy of originally five later six nations of native americans has been preserved including creation stories and some folktales recorded in wampum as recitations written down later the spellings of names differed as transliteration varies and spellings even in european languages were not entirely regularized different versions of some stories exist reflecting different localities and different times it is possible that the written versions were influenced by christianity each village had its own storyteller who was responsible for learning all the stories by heart no stories were ever told during the summer months violations would be punished by the jo-ga-oh and if the violator ignored the warning he would suffer greater evils creation this version of the creation story is taken from converse the earth was a thought in the mind of the ruler of a great island floating above the clouds this ruler was called by various names among them ha-wen-ni-yu meaning he who governs or the ruler the island is a place of calm where all needs are provided and there is no pain or death on this island grew a great apple tree where the inhabitants held council the ruler said let us make a new place where another people can grow under our council tree is a great sea of clouds which calls out for light he ordered the council tree to be uprooted and he looked down into the depths he had ata-en-sic sky woman look down he heard the voice of the sea calling he told ata-en-sic who was pregnant to bring it life he wrapped her in light and dropped her down through the hole all the birds and animals who lived in the great cloud sea were panicked the duck asked where can it rest only the earth can hold it replied the beaverthe oeh-dah from the bottom of our great seai will get some the beaver dove down but never came up then the duck tried but its dead body floated to the surface many of the other birds and animals tried and failed finally the muskrat returned with some earth in his paws its heavy he said who can support it the turtle volunteered and the earth was placed on top of his shell when the earth was ready the birds flew up and carried ata-en-sic on their wings to the turtles back this is how hah-nu-nah the turtle came to be the earth bearer when he moves the sea gets rough and the earth shakes the do-yo-da-no once brought to the surface the oeh-dah grew and became an island ata-en-sic heard two voices under her heart and knew her time had come one voice was calm and quiet but the other was loud and angry these were the do-yo-da-no the twins the good twin hah-gweh-di-yu or teharonhiakwako was born in the normal way the evil twin h-qweh-da-t-gh or sawiskera forced his way out from under his mothers arm killing her after the death of sky woman the island was shrouded in gloom hah-gweh-di-yu shaped the sky and created the sun from his mothers face saying you shall rule here where your face will shine forever h-qweh-da-t-gh however set the great darkness in the west to drive down the sun hah-gweh-di-yu then took the moon and stars from his mothers breast and placed them his sisters to guard the night sky

disappeared h-no and his two nameless assistants caught her in a blanket and brought her back to his cave one of the assistants taken with her beauty married her later h-no rescued her village from a huge serpent which was devastating it with disease he lured the serpent to a spot on buffalo creek where he struck it with a thunderbolt fatally wounded the serpent tried to escape to the safety of lake erie but died before he could get away his body floated downstream and stuck at the head of niagara falls stretching nearly across the river and arching backward the dammed up water broke the

sent one of his monsters to devastate the fields and the other sisters ran away h-qweh-da-t-gh held o-na-tah captive in darkness under the earth until a searching ray of sunlight found her and guided

his history of the dividing line betwixt north carolina and virginia 1728 recorded a tradition of a former religious leader which had been current among the tuscarora tribe they were an iroquoian-speaking tribe historically settled in north carolina that because of warfare migrated to join the rest of the iroquois confederacy in new york in this account many centuries before their tribe had become so dishonest that no mans property nor wife was considered inviolate however their god being unwilling to root them out for their crimes did them the honour to send a messenger from heaven to instruct them and set them a perfect example of integrity and kind behavior towards one another but this holy person with all his eloquence and sanctity of life was able to make very little reformation amongst them some few old men did listen a little to his wholesome advice but all the young fellows were quite incorrigible they not only neglected his precepts but derided and evil entreated his person at last taking upon him to reprove some young rakes of the conechta clan very sharply for their impiety they were so provokd at the freedom of his rebukes that they tied him to a tree and shot him with arrows through the heart but their god took instant vengeance on all who had a hand in that monstrous act by lightning from heaven has ever since visited their nation with a continued train of calamities nor will he ever leave off punishing and wasting their people till he shall have blotted every living soul of them out of the world the three brothers who followed the
