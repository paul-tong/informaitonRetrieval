bepicolombo is a joint mission of the european space agency esa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa to the planet mercury the mission comprises two satellites launched together the mercury planetary orbiter mpo and mio mercury magnetospheric orbiter mmo the mission will perform a comprehensive study of mercury including characterization of its magnetic field magnetosphere and both interior and surface structure it was launched on an ariane 5 rocket on 20 october 2018 at 0145 utc with an arrival at mercury planned for december 2025 after a flyby of earth two flybys of venus and six flybys of mercury the mission was approved in november 2009 after years in proposal and planning as part of the european space agencys horizon 2000 programme it is the last mission of the programme to be launched mission bepicolombo is named after giuseppe bepi colombo 19201984 a scientist mathematician and engineer at the university of padua italy who first implemented the interplanetary gravity-assist manoeuvre during the 1974 mariner 10 mission a technique now commonly used by planetary probes the mission involves three components which will separate into independent spacecraft upon arrival at mercury mercury transfer module mtm for propulsion built by esa mercury planetary orbiter mpo built by esa mercury magnetospheric orbiter mmo or mio built by jaxa during launch and cruise phase these three components are joined together to form the mercury cruise system mcs the prime contractor for esa is airbus defence and space esa is responsible for the overall mission the design development assembly and test of the propulsion and mpo modules and the launch the two orbiters were successfully launched together on 20 october 2018 on ariane flight va245 the spacecraft will have a seven-year interplanetary cruise to mercury using solar-electric propulsion ion thrusters and gravity assists from earth venus and eventual gravity capture at mercury esas cebreros 35-metre ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases arriving in mercury orbit on 5 december 2025 the mio and mpo satellites will separate and observe mercury in collaboration for one year with a possible one-year extension the orbiters are equipped with scientific instruments provided by various european countries and japan the mission will characterize the solid and liquid iron core 4 of the planets radius and determine the size of each the mission will also complete gravitational and magnetic field mappings russia provided gamma ray and neutron spectrometers to verify the existence of water ice in polar craters that are permanently in shadow from the suns rays mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time but it has a tenuous surface-bounded exosphere containing hydrogen helium oxygen sodium calcium potassium and other trace elements its exosphere is not stable as atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources the mission will study the exosphere composition and dynamics including generation and escape objectives the main objectives of the mission are study the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star study mercurys form interior structure geology composition and craters investigate mercurys exosphere composition and dynamics including generation and escape study mercurys magnetised envelope magnetosphere - structure and dynamics investigate the origin of mercurys magnetic field verify einsteins theory of general relativity by measuring the parameters gamma and beta of the parameterized post-newtonian formalism with high accuracy design the stacked spacecraft will take seven years to position itself to enter mercury orbit during this time it will use solar-electric propulsion and nine gravity assists flying past the earth and moon in april 2020 venus in 2020 and 2021 and six mercury flybys between 2021 and 2025 the stacked spacecraft left earth with a hyperbolic excess velocity of 3475kms 2159mis initially the craft is placed in an orbit similar to that of the earth after both the spacecraft and the earth completed one and a half orbits it returns to earth to perform a gravity-assist manoeuvre and is deflected towards venus two consecutive venus flybys reduce the perihelion nearly to mercury distance with almost no need for thrust a sequence of six mercury flybys will lower the relative velocity to 176kms 109mis after the fourth mercury flyby the craft will be in an orbit similar to that of mercury and will remain in the general vicinity of mercury see video four final thrust arcs reduce the relative velocity to the point where mercury will weakly capture the spacecraft on 5 december 2025 into polar orbit only a small manoeuvre is needed to bring the craft into an orbit around mercury with an apocentre of 178000km the orbiters then separate and will adjust their orbits using chemical thrusters schedule as of 2018 the planned mission schedule is history the bepicolombo mission proposal was approved in 2000 by the esa with a science payload proposal request issued in 2004 in 2007 astrium was selected as the prime contractor and the soyuz-fregat launcher was dropped in favor of ariane 5 as the estimated mass increased the initial target launch of july 2014 was postponed several times mostly because of delays on the development of the solar electric propulsion the total cost of the mission is estimated at us2 billion components mercury transfer module the mercury transfer module mtm is located at the base of the stack its role is to carry the two science orbiters to mercury and to support them during the cruise the mtm is equipped with a solar electric propulsion system as the main spacecraft propulsion its four qinetiqt6 ion thrusters operate singly or in pair for a maximum combined thrust of 290mn making it the most powerful ion engine ever operated in space the mtm supplies electrical power for the two hibernating orbiters as well as for its solar electric propulsion system thanks to two 14-meter-long solar panels depending on the probes distance to the sun the generated power will range between 7 and 14kw each t6 requiring between 25 and 45kw according to the desired thrust level the solar electric propulsion system has typically very high specific impulse and low thrust this leads to a flight profile with months-long continuous low-thrust braking phases interrupted by planetary gravity assists to gradually reduce the velocity of the spacecraft moments before mercury orbit insertion the mtm will be jettisoned from the spacecraft stack after separation from the mtm the mpo will provide mio all necessary power and data resources until mio is delivered to its mission orbit separation of mio from mpo will be accomplished by spin-ejection mercury planetary orbiter the mercury planetary orbiter mpo will have a mass of 1150kg 2540lb and will use a single-sided solar array capable of providing up to 1000watts and featuring optical solar reflectors to keep its temperature below 200c 392f the solar array requires continuous rotation keeping the sun at a low incidence angle in order to generate adequate power while at the same time limiting the temperature the mpo will carry a payload of 11 instruments comprising cameras spectrometers ir uv x-ray -ray neutron a radiometer a laser altimeter a magnetometer particle analysers a ka-band transponder and an accelerometer the payload components are mounted on the nadir side of the spacecraft to achieve low detector temperatures apart from the mertis and phebus spectrometers located directly at the main radiator to provide a better field of view a high-temperature-resistant 10m 33ft diameter high-gain antenna is mounted on a short boom on the zenith side of the spacecraft communications will be on the x and ka band with an average bit rate of 50kbits and a total data volume of 1550gbityear esas cebreros 35-metre ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases science payload the
