theodore von krmn hungarian szlskislaki krmn tdor sllkilki karman todor 11 may 1881 6 may 1963 was a hungarian-american mathematician aerospace engineer and physicist who was active primarily in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics he is responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization he is regarded as the outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the twentieth century early life krmn was born into a jewish family in budapest austria-hungary as krmn tdor the son of helen kohn or konn hungarian kohn ilka and mr krmn one of his ancestors was rabbi judah loew ben bezalel he studied engineering at the citys royal joseph technical university known today as budapest university of technology and economics after graduating in 1902 he moved to the german empire and joined ludwig prandtl at the university of gttingen where he received his doctorate in 1908 he taught at gttingen for four years in 1912 he accepted a position as director of the aeronautical institute at rwth aachen university one of the leading german universities his time at rwth aachen was interrupted by service in the austro-hungarian army from 1915 to 1918 during which time he designed the petrczy-krmn-urovec an early helicopter after the war he returned to aachen with his mother and sister josephine de karman some of his students took an interest in gliding and saw the competitions of the rhn-rossitten gesellschaft as an opportunity to advance in aeronautics krmn engaged wolfgang klemperer to design a competitive glider josephine encouraged theodore to expand his science beyond national boundaries they organized the first international conference in mechanics held in september 1922 in innsbruck subsequent conferences were organized as the international union of theoretical and applied mechanics krmn left his post at rwth aachen in 1930 emigration and jpl apprehensive about developments in europe in 1930 krmn accepted the directorship of the guggenheim aeronautical laboratory at the california institute of technology galcit the directorship included provision for a research assistant and he selected frank wattendorf an american who had been studying for three years in aachen another student ernest edwin sechler took up the problem of making reliable airframes for aircraft and with krmns support developed an understanding of aeroelasticity in 1936 krmn engaged the legal services of andrew g haley to form the aerojet corporation with his graduate student frank malina and their experimental rocketry collaborator jack parsons to manufacture jato rocket motors he later became a naturalized citizen of the united states german activity during world war ii increased us military interest in rocket research during the early part of 1943 the experimental engineering division of the united states army air forces material command forwarded to krmn reports from british intelligence sources describing german rockets capable of travelling more than 100 miles 160km in a letter dated 2 august 1943 krmn provided the army with his analysis of and comments on the german program in 1944 he and others affiliated with galcit founded the jet propulsion laboratory jpl which is now a federally funded research and development center managed and operated by caltech under a contract from nasa in 1946 he became the first chairman of the scientific advisory group which studied aeronautical technologies for the united states army air forces he also helped found agard the nato aerodynamics research oversight group 1951 the international council of the aeronautical sciences 1956 the international academy of astronautics 1960 and the von karman institute for fluid dynamics in brussels 1956 he eventually became an important figure in supersonic motion noting in a seminal paper that aeronautical engineers were pounding hard on the closed door leading into the field of supersonic motion last years in june 1944 krmn underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in new york city the surgery caused two hernias and krmns recovery was slow early in september while still in new york he met us army air forces commanding general henry h arnold on a runway at laguardia airport and arnold then proposed that krmn should move to washington dc to lead the scientific advisory group and become a long-range planning consultant to the military krmn returned to pasadena around mid-september was appointed to the sag position on october 23 1944 and left caltech in december 1944 at the age of 81 krmn was the recipient of the first national medal of science bestowed in a white house ceremony by president john f kennedy he was recognized for his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics for his distinguished counsel to the armed services and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering krmn never married he died on a trip to aachen germany in 1963 and his body was returned to the united states to be entombed in the beth olam mausoleum at what is now the hollywood forever cemetery he has sometimes been described as one of the martians krmns fame was in the use of mathematical tools to study fluid flow and the interpretation of those results to guide practical designs he was instrumental in recognizing the importance of the swept-back wings that are ubiquitous in modern jet aircraft selected contributions specific contributions include theories of non-elastic buckling unsteady wakes in circum-cylinder flow stability of laminar flow turbulence airfoils in steady and unsteady flow boundary layers and supersonic aerodynamics he made additional contributions in other fields including elasticity vibration heat transfer and crystallography his name also appears in a number of concepts for example

pioneer in aviation and pathfinder in space little brown p376 isbn978-0316907538 autobiography four years after krmn died his autobiography the wind and beyond was published by lee edson with little brown and company seven major academic journals then followed with book reviews by noted authors as the book was non-technical written for the general reader thomas p hughes cited that as problematic given the technical context of krmns work hughes conceded that krmn exhibited a genius for finding the simplifying assumptions that made possible the mathematical analysis while acknowledging krmns gifts as an applied mathematician and teacher stanley corrsin also points out that the autobiography is marriage between a man and his ego in the later part of his life krmn was a planner of global symposia and societies and a consultant to the upper echelons of the pentagon corps on creativity krmn wrote the finest creative thought comes not out of organized teams but out of the quiet of ones own world in his review i b holley noted penetrating insights into the creative process its ingredients nurture and exploitation according to holley krmn was given to convivial drinking and the company of beautiful women an enthusiastic review by j kestin advised readers to buy and study the book and prize it as a reference on the other hand charles ssskind faults krmn for his contempt for the conventional gaminarie ssskind expected the book to show some reaction to wernher von brauns coming to america and some clarification of the hsue-shen tsien affair rather than lapses into generalities ssskind also tags krmn as a militarist a forthright engineer who is quite unabashed about his lifelong association with military authorities in whatever country he happened to reside at the time sydney goldstein who also wrote the royal society memoir for krmn reviewed the autobiography and remembered an eminent engineer and scientist warm-hearted and witty much traveled well-known by many devoted to international collaboration who in his own words as a scientist found the military the most comfortable group to deal with honors and legacy each year since 1960 the american society of civil engineers has awarded to an individual the theodore von karman medal in recognition of distinguished achievement in engineering mechanics established in 1968 the theodore von krmn prize has been awarded by the society for industrial and applied mathematics to recognize outstanding application of mathematics in mechanics or engineering in 1968 krmn was inducted into the international air space hall of fame in 2005 krmn was named as an honorary fellow of the arnold engineering development center aedc fellows of the aedc are recognized as people who have made exceptionally distinguished contributions to the centers flight testing mission craters on mars and the moon are named in his honor the boundary between the atmosphere and space is named the krmn line in irvine ca there is a five-mile street that runs through the heart of irvines business center named after him in 1977 rwth aachen university named its newly constructed lecture hall complex krmn-auditorium in memory of krmns outstanding research contributions at the universitys aeronautical institute an auditorium at jpl is named after krmn as is a series of monthly lectures held there since 2007 an auditorium at afrl is named after arnold and krmn university of southern california professor shirley thomas after nearly two decades of petitioning was able to create a postage stamp in his honor in 1963 president kennedy awarded krmn the national medal of science dr von karman it is a great pleasure for me to select you as the first recipient of the national medal of science i know of no one else who more completely represents all of the areas with which this award is appropriately concernedscience engineering and education in 1957 krmn became the first recipient of the ludwig-prandtl-ring from deutsche gesellschaft fr luft- und raumfahrt german society for aeronautics and astronautics for outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering in 1956 krmn founded a research institute in sint-genesius-rode belgium which is now named after him the von karman institute for fluid dynamics in 1948 krmn was awarded the franklin medal the american mathematical society selected krmn as its josiah willard gibbs lecturer for 1939 the international von krmn wings award banquet is an annual affair the only still airworthy lisunov li-2 plane reg
