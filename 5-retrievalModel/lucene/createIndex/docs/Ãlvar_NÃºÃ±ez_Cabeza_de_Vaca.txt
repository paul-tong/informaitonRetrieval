of cow was said to be associated with a maternal ancestor martn alhaja he had shown the spanish king a secret mountain pass marked by a cows skull enabling the king to win the battle of las navas de tolosa against the muslim moors in 1212 some sources indicate that after his parents died when he was young the boy lvar was taken in by relatives most likely his aunt and uncle or his paternal grandfather pedro de vera evidence suggests that he probably had a moderately comfortable early life he was appointed chamberlain for the house of a noble family in his teen years then participated in the conquest of the canary islands where he was appointed a governor in 1511 he enlisted in the spanish army serving in italy with distinction spain and navarre he received several medals of honor and became more of a political figure in spain in 1527 nez joined the florida expedition of conquistador pnfilo de narvez during which he served as treasurer and marshal narvez expedition and early native american relations in 1527 pnfilo de narvez was sent by spains king charles v to explore the unknown territory which the spanish called la florida including not only present-day florida but a large poorly-defined section of what today is the southeastern united states cabeza de vaca was attached to this expedition as the expeditions treasurer records indicate that he also had a military role as one of the chief officers on the narvez expedition noted as sheriff or marshal on june 17 1527 the fleet of five ships set sail towards the province of pnuco which was on the western border of florida when they stopped in hispaniola for supplies narvez lost approximately 150 of his men who chose to stay on the island rather than continue with the expedition the expedition continued to cuba where cabeza de vaca took two ships to recruit more men and buy supplies their fleet was battered by a hurricane resulting in the destruction of both ships and loss of most of cabeza de vacas men narvez arrived days later to pick up the survivors by february 1528 the remaining ships and men resumed their expedition reaching florida in april they anchored near what is now known as the jungle prada site in st petersburg claiming this land as a possession of the spanish crown after communicating with the native americans the spanish heard rumours that a city named apalachen was full of food and gold against the advice of cabeza de vaca narvez decided to split up his men some 300 were to go on foot to apalachen and the other would sail to pnuco apalachen had no gold but had only corn but the explorers were told a village known as aute about 5 or 9 days away was rich they pushed on through the swamps harassed by the native americans a few spanish men were killed and more wounded when they arrived in aute they found that the inhabitants had burned down the village and left but the fields had not been harvested so at least the spanish scavenged food there after several months of fighting native inhabitants through wilderness and swamp the party decided to abandon the interior and try to reach pnuco slaughtering and eating their remaining horses they gathered the stirrups spurs horseshoes and other metal items they fashioned a bellows from deer hide to make a fire hot enough to forge tools and nails they used these in making five primitive boats to use to get to mexico cabeza de vaca commanded one of these vessels each of which held 50 men depleted of food and water the men followed the coast westward but when they reached the mouth of the mississippi river the powerful current swept them out into the gulf where the five rafts were separated by a hurricane some lives were lost forever including that of narvez two crafts with about 40 survivors each including cabeza de vaca wrecked on or near galveston island now part of texas out of the 80 or so survivors only 15 lived past that winter the explorers called the island malhado ill fate in spanish or the island of doom they tried to repair the rafts using what remained of their own clothes as oakum to plug holes but they lost the rafts to a large wave as the number of survivors dwindled rapidly they were enslaved for a few years by various american indian tribes of the upper gulf coast because cabeza de vaca survived and prospered from time to time some scholars argue that he was not enslaved but using a figure of speech he and other noblemen were accustomed to better living their encounters with harsh conditions and weather and being required to work like native women must have seemed like slavery the tribes to which cabeza de vaca was enslaved included the hans and the capoques and tribes later called the karankawa and coahuiltecan after escaping only four men cabeza de vaca andrs dorantes de carranza alonso del castillo maldonado and an enslaved moroccan berber named esteban later called estevanico survived to reach mexico city traveling mostly with this small group cabeza de vaca explored what is now the us state of texas as well as the northeastern mexican states of tamaulipas nuevo len and coahuila and possibly smaller portions of new mexico and arizona he traveled on foot through the then-colonized territories of texas and the coast he continued through coahuila and nueva vizcaya then down the gulf of california coast to what is now sinaloa mexico over a period of roughly eight years throughout those years cabeza de vaca and the other men adapted to the lives of the indigenous people they stayed with whom he later described as roots people the fish and blackberry people or the fig people depending on their principal foods during his wanderings passing from tribe to tribe cabeza de vaca later reported that he developed sympathies for the indigenous peoples he became a trader and a healer which gave him some freedom to travel among the tribes as a healer cabeza de vaca used blowing like the native americans to heal but claimed that god and the christian cross led to his success his healing of the sick gained him a reputation as a faith healer his group attracted numerous native followers who regarded them as children of the sun endowed with the power to heal and destroy as cabeza de vaca grew healthier he decided that he would make his way to pnuco supporting himself through trading he finally decided to try to reach the spanish colony in mexico many natives were said to accompany the explorers on their journey across what is now known as the american southwest and northern mexico after finally reaching the colonized lands of new spain where he first encountered fellow spaniards near modern-day culiacn cabeza de vaca and the three other men reached mexico city from there he sailed back to europe in 1537 numerous researchers have tried to trace his route across the southwest as he did not begin writing his chronicle until back in spain he had to rely on memory he did not have the instruments clock and astrolabe to determine his location he had to rely on dead reckoning and was uncertain of his route aware that his recollection has numerous errors in chronology and geography historians have worked to put together pieces of the puzzle to discern his paths return to america in 1540 cabeza de vaca was appointed adelantado of the ro de la plata in south america the colony comprised parts of what is now argentina paraguay and uruguay cabeza de vaca was assigned to find a usable route from this colony to the colony in peru on the other side of the andes mountains on the pacific coast en route he disembarked from his fleet at santa catarina island in modern brazil with an indigenous force plus 250 musketeers and 26 horses he followed native trails discovered by aleixo garcia overland to the districts spanish capital asuncin far inland on the great paraguay river cabeza de vaca is thought to have been the first european to see the iguau falls in march 1542 cabeza de vaca met with domingo martnez de irala and relieved him of his position as governor the government of asuncin pledged loyalty to cabeza de vaca and irala was assigned to explore a possible route to peru once irala returned and reported cabeza de vaca planned his own expedition he hoped to reach los reyes a base that irala set up and push forward into the jungle in search of a route to the gold and silver mines of peru the expedition did not go well and cabeza de vaca returned to asuncin during his absence irala had stirred up resistance to cabeza de vacas rule and capitalized on political rivalries scholars widely agree that cabeza de vaca had an unusually sympathetic attitude towards the native americans for his time the elite settlers in modern argentina known as encomenderos generally did not agree with his enlightened conduct toward the natives they wanted to use them for labor because he lost elite support and buenos aires was failing as a settlement not attracting enough residents martnez de irala arrested cabeza de vaca in 1544 for poor administration the former explorer was returned to spain in 1545 for trial although eventually exonerated cabeza de vaca never returned to south america he wrote an extensive report on the ro de la plata colony in south america strongly criticizing the conduct of martnez de irala the report was bound with his earlier la relacin and published under the title comentarios commentary he died poor in seville around the year 1560 la relacin of lvar nez cabeza de vaca la relacin of lvar nez cabeza de vaca is the account of his experiences with the narvaez expedition and after being wrecked on galveston island in november 1528 cabeza de vaca and his last three men struggled to survive they wandered along the texas coast as prisoners of the han and capoque american indians for two years while cabeza de vaca observed the people picking up their ways of life and customs they traveled through the american southwest and ultimately reached mexico city nearly eight years after being wrecked on the island in 1537 cabeza de vaca returned to spain where he wrote his narratives of the narvaez expedition these narratives were collected and published in 1542 in spain they are now known as the relation of lvar nez cabeza de vaca the narrative of cabeza de vaca is the first european book devoted completely to north america his detailed account describes the lives of numerous tribes of american indians of the time cabeza de vaca showed compassion and respect for native peoples which together with the great detail he recorded distinguishes his narrative from others of the period role of observer cabeza de vaca reported on the customs and ways of american indian life aware of his status as an early european explorer he spent eight years with various peoples including the capoque han avavare and arbadao he describes details of the culture of the malhado people the capoque and han american indians such as their treatment of offspring their wedding rites and their main sources of food cabeza de vaca and his three fellow survivors at times served as slaves to the american indians to survive through his observations cabeza de vaca provides insights into 16th-century american indian life near the present-day mexico-texas border for many peoples the accounts of cabeza de vaca and hernando de soto are the only written records of their existence by the time of the next european contact many had vanished possibly from diseases carried by cabeza de vaca and his companions ambassador for christ one of cabeza de vacas greatest achievements of his journey was that he played an important role as an ambassador to bring peace throughout the land as the party of travellers passed from one tribe to the next warring tribes would immediately make peace and become friendly so that the natives could receive the party and give them gifts cabeza notes in his personal account of his journey that in this way we left the whole country in peace cabeza saw these events as part of his mission and purpose in america acknowledging in his account that he believed that god was guiding us to where we could serve him cabezas greatest challenge as an ambassador came when he attempted to bring peace between the conquering spanish army and the natives as cabeza approached spanish settlement he and his companions were very grieved to see the destruction of the native villages and enslavement of the natives the fertile land lay uncultivated and the natives were nearly starving hiding in the forest for fear of the spanish army cabeza then encountered diego de alcaraz commander of a slavery expedition of about 20 horsemen and attempted to negotiate peace between them and the natives however as soon as they departed diego went back on his word and plundered cabezas entourage of natives that he had sent back home not long after this cabeza encountered the chief alcalde spanish captain of the province named melchor diaz melchor diaz ordered cabeza to bring the natives back from the forests so that they would re-cultivate the land cabeza and melchor invited the natives to convert to christianity and the natives did so willingly cabeza instructed them to build a large wooden cross in each village which would cause members of the spanish army to pass through the village and not attack it soon afterward the diego de alcaraz expedition returned and explained to melchor that they were shocked at how on their return journey not only did they find the land repopulated but the natives coming to greet them with crosses in hand and also gave them provisions melchor then ordered diego that no harm be done to them personal report cabeza de vaca wrote this narrative to charles v to transmit what i saw and heard in the nine years i wandered lost and miserable over many remote lands he wanted to convey not merely a report of positions and distances flora and fauna but of the customs of the numerous indigenous people i talked with and dwelt among as well as any other matters i could hear of or observe he took care to present facts as a full account of what he observed the relation is the only account of many details concerning the indigenous people whom he encountered the accuracy of his account has been validated by later reports of others as well as by the oral traditions of descendants of some of the tribes cabezas account also served as a petition to the king of spain to both establish a permanent christian mission and eventually establish the native tribes as a nation under the governance of spain in his reflection cabeza writes to the king of spain may god in his infinite mercy grant that in the days of your majesty and under your power and sway these people become willingly and sincerely subjects of the true lord who created and redeemed them we believe they will be and that your majesty is destined to bring it about as it will not be at all difficult cabeza
