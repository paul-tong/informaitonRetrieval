henrietta swan leavitt lvt july 4 1868 december 12 1921 was an american astronomer a graduate of radcliffe college she worked at the harvard college observatory as a computer tasked with examining photographic plates in order to measure and catalog the brightness of stars this work led her to discover the relation between the luminosity and the period of cepheid variables though she received little recognition in her lifetime leavitts discovery provided astronomers with the first standard candle with which to measure the distance to faraway galaxies after her death edwin hubble used leavitts luminosityperiod relation together with the galactic spectral shifts first measured by vesto slipher at lowell observatory in order to establish that the universe is expanding see hubbles law life early years and education henrietta swan leavitt was born in lancaster massachusetts the daughter of congregational church minister george roswell leavitt and his wife henrietta swan kendrick she was a descendant of deacon john leavitt an english puritan tailor who settled in the massachusetts bay colony in the early seventeenth century in the early massachusetts records the family name was spelled levett leavitt attended oberlin college before transferring to harvard universitys society for the collegiate instruction of women later known as radcliffe college receiving a bachelors degree in 1892 at oberlin and harvard leavitt studied a broad curriculum that included classical greek fine arts philosophy analytic geometry and calculus it wasnt until her fourth year of college that leavitt took a course in astronomy in which she earned an a leavitt also began working as one of the women human computers at the harvard college observatory hired by its director edward charles pickering to measure and catalog the brightness of stars as they appeared in the observatorys photographic plate collection in the early 1900s women were not allowed to operate telescopes in 1893 leavitt obtained credits toward a graduate degree in astronomy for her work at the harvard college observatory but she never completed that degree leavitt left the observatory to make two trips to europe and complete a stint as an art assistant at beloit college in wisconsin at this time she contracted an illness that caused her increasingly to lose her hearing astronomical career leavitt returned to the harvard college observatory in 1903 because leavitt had independent means pickering initially did not have to pay her later she received 030 an hour for her work being paid only 1050 per week she was reportedly hard-working serious-minded little given to frivolous pursuits and selflessly devoted to her family her church and her career one of the women that leavitt worked with in the harvard observatory was annie jump cannon who shared the experience of being deaf pickering assigned leavitt to the study of variable stars of the small and large magellanic clouds as recorded on photographic plates taken with the bruce astrograph of the boyden station of the harvard observatory in arequipa peru she identified 1777 variable stars in 1908 she published her results in the annals of the astronomical observatory of harvard college noting that the brighter variables had the longer period in another paper published in 1912 leavitt looked carefully at the relation between the periods and the brightness of a sample of 25 of the cepheids variables in the small magellanic cloud this paper was communicated and signed by edward pickering but the first sentence indicates that it was prepared by miss leavitt leavitt made a graph of magnitude versus logarithm of period and determined that in her own words a straight line can be readily drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the cepheid variables and their periods she then used the simplifying assumption that all of the cepheids within the small magellanic cloud were at approximately the same distance so that their intrinsic brightness could be deduced from their apparent brightness as registered in the photographic plates up to a scale factor since the distance to the magellanic clouds were as yet unknown she expressed the hope that parallaxes to some cepheids would be measured which eventually happened thereby allowing her period-luminosity scale to be calibrated this reasoning allowed leavitt to establish that the logarithm of the period is linearly related to the logarithm of the stars average intrinsic optical luminosity which is the amount of power radiated by the star in the visible spectrum leavitt also developed and continued to refine the harvard standard for photographic measurements a logarithmic scale that orders stars by brightness over 17 magnitudes she initially analyzed 299 plates from 13 telescopes to construct her scale which was accepted by the international committee of photographic magnitudes in 1913 leavitt was a member of phi beta kappa the american association of university women the american astronomical and astrophysical society the american association for the advancement of science and an honorary member of the american association of variable star observers in 1921 when harlow shapley took over as director of the observatory leavitt was made head of stellar photometry by the end of that year she had succumbed to cancer and was buried in the leavitt family plot at cambridge cemetery in cambridge massachusetts illness and death leavitts scientific work at harvard was frequently interrupted by illness and family obligations her early death at the age of 53 was seen as a tragedy by her colleagues for reasons that went beyond her scientific achievements her colleague solon i bailey wrote in her obituary that she had the happy faculty of appreciating all that was worthy and lovable in others and was possessed of a nature so full of sunshine that to her all of life became beautiful and full of meaning sitting at the top of a gentle hill writes george johnson in his biography of leavitt the spot is marked by a tall hexagonal monument on top of which sits a globe cradled on a draped marble pedestal her uncle erasmus darwin leavitt and his family also are buried there along with other leavitts a plaque memorializing henrietta and her two siblings mira and roswell is mounted on one side of the monument nearby are the graves of henry and william james there is no epitaph at the gravesite memorializing henrietta leavitts achievements in astronomy scientific impact according to science writer jeremy bernstein variable stars had been of interest for years but when she was studying those plates i doubt pickering thought she would make a significant discoveryone that would eventually change astronomy the periodluminosity relationship for cepheids now known as leavitts law made the stars the first standard candle in astronomy allowing scientists to compute the distances to galaxies too remote for stellar parallax observations to be useful one year after leavitt reported her results ejnar hertzsprung determined the distance of several cepheids in the milky way and that with this calibration the distance to any cepheid could be accurately determined cepheids were soon detected in other galaxies such as andromeda notably by edwin hubble in 192324 and they became an important part of the evidence that spiral nebulae are independent galaxies located far outside of our own milky way thus leavitts discovery would forever change our picture of the universe as it prompted harlow shapley to move our sun from the center of the galaxy in the great debate and edwin hubble to move our galaxy from the center of the universe leavitts discovery of a way to accurately measure distances on an inter-galactic scale paved the way for modern astronomys understanding of the structure and scale of the universe the accomplishments of edwin hubble the american astronomer who established that the universe is expanding also were made possible by leavitts groundbreaking research hubble often said that leavitt deserved the nobel prize for her work mathematician gsta mittag-leffler a member of the swedish academy of sciences tried to nominate her for that prize in 1924 only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier the nobel prize is not awarded posthumously posthumous honors the asteroid 5383 leavitt and the crater leavitt on the moon are named after her to honor deaf men and women who have worked as astronomers one of asas-sn telescopes located in the mcdonald observatory in texas is named in her honor books and plays lauren gunderson wrote a play silent sky which followed leavitts journey from her acceptance at harvard to her death george johnson wrote a biography miss leavitts stars which showcases the triumphs of womens progress in science through the
