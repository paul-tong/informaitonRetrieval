the crown of castile was a medieval state in the iberian peninsula that formed in 1230 as a result of the third and definitive union of the crowns and some decades later the parliaments of the kingdoms of castile and len upon the accession of the then castilian king ferdinand iii to the vacant leonese throne it continued to exist as a separate entity after the personal union in 1469 of the crowns of castile and aragon with the marriage of the catholic monarchs up to the promulgation of the nueva planta decrees by philip v in 1715 the indies islands and mainland of the ocean sea were also a part of the crown of castile when transformed from lordships to kingdoms of the heirs of castile in 1506 with the treaty of villaffila and upon the death of ferdinand the catholic the title of king of castile remained in use by the habsburg rulers during the 16th and 17th centuries charles i was king of aragon majorca valencia and sicily and count of barcelona roussillon and cerdagne as well as king of castile and len 15161556 in the early 18th century philip of bourbon won the war of the spanish succession and imposed unification policies over the crown of aragon supporters of their enemies this unified the crown of aragon and the crown of castile into the kingdom of spain even though the nueva planta decrees did not formally abolish the crown of castile the country of castile and aragon was called spain by both contemporaries and historians king of castile also remains part of the full title of felipe vi of spain the current king of spain according to the spanish constitution of 1978 in the sense of titles not of states history preceding events two kingdoms len and castile the kingdom of len arose out of the kingdom of asturias the kingdom of castile appeared initially as a county of the kingdom of len from the second half of the 10th century to the first half of the 11th century it changed hands between len and the kingdom of navarre in the 11th century it became a kingdom in its own right the two kingdoms had been united twice previously from 1037 until 1065 under ferdinand i of len upon his death his kingdoms passed to his sons len to alfonso vi castile to sancho ii and galicia to garca from 1072 until 1157 under alfonso vi died 1109 urraca died 1126 and alfonso vii from 1111 until 1126 galicia was separate from the union under alfonso vii in 1157 the kingdoms were divided between alfonsos sons with ferdinand ii receiving len and sancho iii castile crown of castile from the rule of ferdinand iii until the ascension of charles i union of the two kingdoms under ferdinand iii ferdinand iii received the kingdom of castile from his mother queen berengaria of castile granddaughter of sancho iii in 1217 and the kingdom of len from his father alfonso ix of len son of ferdinand ii in 1230 from then on the two kingdoms were united under the name of the kingdom of len and castile or simply as the crown of castile ferdinand iii later conquered the guadalquivir valley while his son alfonso x conquered the kingdom of murcia from al-andalus further extending the area of the crown of castile given this the kings of the crown of castile traditionally styled themselves king of castile len toledo galicia murcia jan crdoba seville and lord of biscay and molina among other possessions they later gained the heir to the throne has been titled prince of asturias since the 14th century union of the cortes and the legal code almost immediately after the union of the two kingdoms under ferdinand iii the parliaments of castile and len were united it was divided into three estates which corresponded with the nobility the church and the cities and included representation from castile len galicia toledo navarre and the basque provinces initially the number of cities represented in the cortes varied over the next century until john i permanently set those that would be allowed to send representatives procuradores burgos toledo len sevilla crdoba murcia jan zamora segovia vila salamanca cuenca toro valladolid soria madrid and guadalajara with granada added after its conquest in 1492 under alfonso x most sessions of the cortes of both kingdoms were held jointly the cortes of 1258 in valladolid comprised representatives of castile extremadura and len de castiella e de estremadura e de tierra de len and those of seville in 1261 of castile len and all other kingdoms de castiella e de len e de todos los otros nuestros regnos subsequent cortes were celebrated separately for example in 1301 that of castile in burgos and that of len in zamora but the representatives demanded that the parliaments be reunited from then on although the individual kingdoms and cities initially retained their individual historical rights-including the old fuero of castile viejo fuero de castilla and the different fueros of the municipal councils of castile len extremadura and andaluca-a unified legal code for the entire new kingdom was created in the siete partidas c 1265 the ordenamiento de alcal 1248 and the leyes de toro 1505 these laws continued to be in force until 1889 when a new spanish civil code the cdigo civil espaol was enacted spanish languages and universities in the 13th century there were many languages spoken in the kingdoms of len and castile among them castilian leonese basque and galician-portuguese but as the century progressed castilian gained increasing prominence as the language of culture and communication- one example of this is the cantar de mio cid in the last years of the reign of ferdinand iii castilian began to be used for some important documents such as the visigothic code the basis of the legal code for christians living in muslim cordova but it was during the reign of alfonso x that it became the official language henceforth all public documents were written in castilian likewise all translations of arabic legal and government documents were made into castilian instead of latin some scholars think that the substitution of castilian for latin was due to the strength of the new language whereas others consider that it was due to the influence of hebrew-speaking intellectuals who were hostile towards latin the language of the christian church in 1492 under the catholic monarchs the first edition of the grammar of the castilian language by antonio de nebrija was published castilian was eventually carried to the americas in the 16th century by the conquistadors because of castilians importance in the land ruled by the spanish crown the language is also known as spanish furthermore in the 13th century many universities were founded where instruction was in castilian such as the leonese university of salamanca the castilian estudio general of palencia and the university of valladolid which were among the first universities in europe ascension of the trastmara dynasty on the death of alfonso xi a dynastic conflict started between his sons the infantes peter pedro and henry count of trastmara which became entangled in the hundred years war between england and france alfonso xi had married maria of portugal with whom he had his heir the infante peter however the king also had many illegitimate children with eleanor of guzman among them the above-mentioned henry who disputed peters right to the throne once the latter became king in the resulting struggle in which both brothers claimed to be king pedro allied himself with edward prince of wales the black prince in 1367 the black prince defeated henry iis allies at the battle of njera restoring pedros control of the kingdom the black prince seeing that the king would not reimburse his expenses left castile henry who had fled to france took advantage of the opportunity and recommenced the fight henry finally was victorious in 1369 in the battle of montiel in which he had peter killed in 1371 the brother of the black prince john of gaunt 1st duke of lancaster married constance peters daughter in 1386 he claimed the crown of castile in the name of his wife the legitimate heir according to the cortes de seville of 1361 he arrived in a corua with an army and took the city he then moved on to occupy santiago de compostela pontevedra and vigo he asked john i henry iis son to give up the throne in favor of constance john declined but proposed that his son the infante henry marry john of gaunts daughter catherine the proposal was accepted and the title prince of asturias was created for henry and catherine this ended the dynastic conflict strengthened the house of trastmaras position and created peace between england and castile relations with the crown of aragon during the 14th century during the reign of henry iii royal power was restored overshadowing the much powerful castilian nobility in his later years henry delegated some of his power to his brother ferdinand i of antequera who would be regent along with his wife catherine of lancaster during the childhood of his son john ii after the compromise of caspe in 1412 ferdinand left castile to become king of aragon upon the death of his mother john ii at the age of 14 took to the throne and married his cousin maria of aragon the young king entrusted his government to regent lvaro de luna the most influential person in court and allied with the lesser nobility the cities the clergy and the jews this brought together the mutual dislikes of the king shared by the greater castilian nobility and the aragonese infantes sons of ferdinand i of antequera who sought to control the castilian crown this eventually led to war in 1429 and 1430 between the two kingdoms lvaro de luna won the war and expelled the aragonese infantes from castile second conflict of succession henry iv unsuccessfully tried to re-establish the peace with the nobility that his father john ii had shattered when his second wife joan of portugal gave birth to infanta joanna it was claimed that she was the result of an affair of the queen with beltrn de la cueva one of the kings chief ministers the king besieged by riots and the demands of the nobles had to sign a treaty in which he named as his successor his half-brother alfonso leaving infanta joanna out of the line of succession after the death of alfonso in an accident henry iv signed the treaty of the bulls of guisando with his half-sister isabella i in which he named her heiress in return for her marrying a prince chosen by him catholic monarchs union with the crown of aragon in october 1469 isabella i and ferdinand ii heir to the throne of aragon married in secret in the palacio de los vivero in castilian valladolid the consequence was a dynastic union of the crown of castile and the crown of aragon in 1479 when ferdinand ascended to the aragonese throne this union however was not effective until the reign of his grandson charles i holy roman emperor charles v ferdinand and isabella were related and had married without papal approval although isabella wanted to marry ferdinand she refused to proceed with the marriage until she received a papal dispensation consequently ferdinands father forged a papal dispensation for the two to marry isabella believed that the dispensation was authentic and the marriage went ahead a genuine papal dispensation arrived afterwards later pope alexander vi bestowed upon them the title of los reyes catlicos the catholic monarchs henry iv half brother of isabella considered the marriage of ferdinand and isabella as breaking the treaty of tratado de los toros de guisando under which isabella would ascend to the castilian throne on his death only if her suitor was approved by him henry wanted to ally castile with portugal or france rather than aragon he therefore decided to name his daughter infanta joanna as heiress to the throne rather than isabella i when he died in 1474 the war of the castilian succession broke out over who would ascend to the throne it lasted until 1479 when isabella and her supporters came out victorious after isabellas victory in the civil war and ferdinands ascension to the aragonese throne the two crowns were united under the same monarchs however this was a personal union and both kingdoms remained administratively separate to some extent each maintaining largely its own laws both parliaments remained separate the only common institution would be the inquisition despite their titles of monarchs of castile leon aragon and sicily ferdinand and isabella reigned over their respective territories although they also took decisions together its central position larger territorial area three times greater than that of aragon and larger population 43million as opposed to the 1 million in aragon led to castile becoming the dominating partner in the union as a result of the reconquista reconquest the castilian aristocracy had become very powerful the monarchs needed to assert their authority over the nobility and the clergy with this end in mind they founded a law enforcement body the consejo de la hermandad more commonly known as the santa hermandad the holy brotherhood which was staffed and funded by the municipalities they also took further measures against the nobility destroying feudal castles prohibiting private wars and reducing the power of the adelantados a governor-like military office in regions recently conquered the monarchy incorporated military orders under the consejo de las rdenes in 1495 reinforced royal judicial power over the feudal one and transformed the audiencias into the supreme judicial bodies the crown also sought to better control the cities and so in 1480 in the cortes of toledo it created the corregidores representatives of the crown which supervised the city councils in religion they reformed religious orders and sought unity of the various sections of the church they pressured jews to convert to catholicism in some cases persecuted by the inquisition finally in 1492 the monarchs decided that those who would not convert would be expelled it is estimated that between 50000 and 70000 people were expelled from castile from 1502 onwards they began to convert the muslim population between 1478 and 1497 the monarchs forces conquered the three canary islands of gran canaria la palma and tenerife on 2 january 1492 the monarchs entered granadas alhambra marking the completion and end of the reconquista also in 1492 the christopher columbus maritime expedition claimed the newly found lands in the americas for the crown of castile and began the new world conquests in 1497 castile conquered melilla on the north coast of north africa after castiles conquest of the kingdom of granada its politics turned towards the mediterranean and castile militarily helped aragon in its problems with france culminating in the reconquest of naples for the crown of aragon in 1504 later that same year isabella died on november 26 period of regency joanna i upon isabella is death 1504 the crown passed to her daughter joanna who was married to philip of austria nicknamed philip the handsome but isabella knew of her daughters possible mental health incapacities and so nicknamed juana la loca or joanna the mad and named ferdinand as regent in the case that joanna didnt want to or couldnt fulfil her duties in the salamanca agreement of 1505 it was decided that the government would be shared by philip i ferdinand v and joanna however poor relations between phillip who was supported by the castilian nobility and ferdinand resulted in ferdinand renouncing his regents powers in castile in order to avoid an armed conflict through the concordia de villaffila of 1506 ferdinand returned to aragon and phillip was recognized as king of castile with joanna a co-monarch in the treaty of villaffila in 1506 king ferdinand the catholic renounced not only the government of castile in favour of his son-in-law philip i of castile but also the lordship of the indies withholding a half of the income of the kingdoms of the indies joanna of castile and philip immediately added to their titles the kingdoms of indies islands and mainland of the ocean sea phillip died and ferdinand returned in 1507 once again to be regent for joanna her isolated confinement-imprisonment in the santa clara convent at tordesillas to last over fifty years until death began with her fathers orders in 1510 in 1512 a joint castilian-aragonese force invaded navarre and most of the kingdom of navarre south of the pyrenees was annexed to castile crown of castile within habsburg spain charles i charles i received the crown of castile the crown of aragon and the empire through a combination of dynastic marriages and premature deaths when his father philip i died in 1506 he became sovereign of the netherlands upon the death of ferdinand ii of aragon his grandfather in 1516 he gained the rule of aragon and castile with the americas in co-regency title with his mother queen joanna he maintained her confinement-imprisonment so she was queen of aragon and of castile in title only upon the death of maximilian his paternal grandfather in 1519 charles was elected holy roman emperor as a consequence of which he is better-known as charles v holy roman emperor charles i was not well received in castile this was partly because he was a foreign-born king born in ghent and even before his arrival in castile he had granted important positions to flemish citizens and had used castilian money to fund his court the castilian nobility and the cities were on the verge of an uprising to defend their rights many castilians favoured the kings younger brother ferdinand who grew up in castile and in fact the council of castile opposed the idea of charles as king of castile in 1518 the castilian parliament in valladolid named the wallonian jean de sauvage as its president this caused angry protests in the parliament which rejected the presence of foreigners in its deliberations despite threats the parliament led by juan de zumel representing burgos resisted and forced the king to respect the laws of castile remove all foreigners from important governmental posts and learn to speak castilian after taking his oath charles received a subsidy of 600000 ducats charles was conscious of the fact that he had options to become emperor and needed to impose his authority over castile to gain access to its riches for his imperial goals the riches from the americas came through castile which was one of the more dynamic rich and advanced territories in europe in the 16th century it started to realise that it could become immersed within an empire this added to the broken promise of charles only increased hostility towards the king in 1520 in toledo parliament rejected a further subsidy for the king parliament in santiago de compostela reached the same decision finally when parliament was held in a corua many members were bribed and others denied entry with the result that the subsidy was approved those members who voted in favour were attacked by the castilian people and their houses were burned parliament was not the only opposition which charles would come up against when he left castile in 1520 the castilian war of the communities broke out los comuneros were defeated one year later 1521 after their defeat parliament was reduced to a merely consultative body imperial policies of philip ii philip ii continued the politics of charles i but unlike his father he made castile the core of the spanish empire centralising all administration in madrid the other spanish regions maintained certain degree of autonomy being governed by a viceroy in fact since the reign of charles i the financial burden of the empire had fallen mainly on castile but under philip ii the cost quadrupled during his reign as well as increasing existing taxes he created some new ones among them the excusado in 1567 that same year philip ordered the proclamation of the la pragmtica an act whereby all moriscos had to abandon all moorish traditions and become true catholics this edict limited religious linguistic and cultural freedom of the morisco population and provoked the morisco revolt 15681571 which was put down by john of austria castile entered a phase of recession in 1575 spain as a whole followed which provoked the suspension of wages the third of his reign in 1590 the cortes approved the millones a new tax on food this exhausted castilian cities and hindered the economy in 1596 pay was once again suspended later habsburgs in the previous kingdoms positions in national institutions were filled by educated gentlemen philip iis administrators would normally come from either the university of alcal or the university of salamanca after philip iii the nobility once again asserted their right to govern the country in order to show that there was a new order ruling there was a cleansing of the blood of spain religious persecution led philip to declare the expulsion of the moriscos in 1609 faced with the collapse of the exchequer in order to maintain the hegemony of philip ivs spanish empire the count-duke of olivares the kings favourite valido from 1621 to 1643 tried to introduce a series of reforms among these was the unin de armas the creation of a new army of 140000 reservists every territory within the kingdom contributed citizens proportionally in order to maintain the force his aims of union did not work and the spanish crown continued as a confederation of kingdoms luis mndez de haro took over from olivares as favourite philip iv between 1659 and 1665 this was in order to alleviate interior conflicts sparked off by his predecessor revolts in portugal catalonia and andalusia and achieve peace in europe upon the death of philip iv in 1665 and with the incapacity of charles ii to govern spain suffered an economic slowdown and battles for power between the different favourites the death of charles ii in 1700 without descendants provoked the war of the spanish succession after the war all the territories were unified as a single country under the crown
