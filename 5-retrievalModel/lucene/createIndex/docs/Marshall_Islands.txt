one of the malayo-polynesian languages and english almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion with three-quarters of the country either following the united church of christ congregational in the marshall islands ucccmi or the assemblies of god history evidence suggests that around 3000 years ago successive waves of human migrants from southeast asia spread across the western pacific populating its many small islands the marshall islands were settled by micronesians in the 2nd millennium bc little is known of the islands early history early settlers traveled between the islands by canoe using traditional stick charts the spanish explorer alonso de salazar landed there in 1526 and the archipelago came to be known as los pintados the painted ones possibly referring to the autochthonous people first found there las hermanas the sisters and los jardines the gardens within the spanish empire first falling within the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of new spain to then be administered directly by madrid through the captaincy general of the philippines upon the independence of latin america and the dissolution of new spain starting in 1821 they were only formally possessed by spain for much of their colonial history and were generally considered part of the carolines present-day federated state of micronesia palau and the us territories of marianas and guam as well as the marshall islands themselves or alternatively the nuevas filipinas new philippines the islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short-lived religious missions documented in 1668 and 1731 during the 16th and 17th centuries they were largely ignored by european powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the iberian empires portugal and castilian spain in 1529 1750 and 1777 the archipelago corresponding to the present-day country was independently named by krusenstern after british explorer john marshall who visited them together with thomas gilbert in 1788 en route from botany bay to canton two ships of the first fleet and started establishing german and british trading posts not formally contested by spain the marshall islands were formally claimed by spain in 1874 through its capital in the east indies manila marking the start of several strategic moves by the second reich during the 1870s and 80s to annex them claiming them to be by chance unoccupied this policy would culminate in a tense naval episode in 1885 which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of spains naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the german side following papal mediation and german compensation of 45 million spain reached an agreement with germany in 1885 the 1885 hispano-german protocol of rome this accord established a protectorate and set up trading stations on the islands of jaluit jol and ebon to carry out the flourishing copra dried coconut meat trade marshallese iroij
