luna 9 -9 internal designation ye-6 no13 was an unmanned space mission of the soviet unions luna programme on 3 february 1966 the luna 9 spacecraft became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the moon spacecraft the lander had a mass of 99 kilograms 218lb it used a landing bag to survive the impact speed of 22 kilometres per hour 61ms 14mph it was a hermetically sealed container with radio equipment a program timing device heat control systems scientific apparatus power sources and a television system launch and translunar coast luna 9 was launched by a molniya-m rocket serial number 103-32 flying from site 316 at the baikonur cosmodrome in the kazakh soviet socialist republic liftoff took place at 114137 utc on 31 january 1966 the first three stages of the four-stage carrier rocket injected the payload and fourth stage into low earth orbit at an altitude of 168 by 219 kilometres 104 by 136mi and 518 degrees inclination the fourth stage a blok-l then fired to raise the orbits perigee to a new apogee approximately 500000 kilometres 310000mi before deploying luna 9 into a highly elliptical geocentric orbit the spacecraft then spun itself up to 067 rpm using nitrogen jets on 1 february at 1929 ut a mid-course correction took place involving a 48-second burn and resulting in a delta-v of 712 metres per second 234fts descent and landing at an altitude of 8300 kilometres 5200mi from the moon the spacecraft was oriented for the firing of its retrorockets and its spin was stopped in preparation for landing from this moment the orientation of the spacecraft was supported by measurements of directions to the sun and the earth using an opto-mechanical system at 74885 kilometres 46531mi above the lunar surface the radar altimeter triggered the jettison of the side modules the inflation of the air bags and the firing of the retro rockets approximately at 250 metres 820ft from the surface the main retrorocket was turned off by the integrator of an acceleration having reached the planned velocity of the braking manoeuver the four outrigger engines were used to slow the craft approximately 5 metres 16ft above the lunar surface a contact sensor touched the ground triggering the engines to be shut down and the landing capsule to be ejected the craft landed at 22 kilometres per hour 61ms 14mph the spacecraft bounced several times before coming to rest in oceanus procellarum west of reiner and marius craters at approximately 708 n 6437 w on 3 february 1966 at 184530 ut the spacecraft was developed in the design bureau then known as okb-1 under chief designer sergei korolev who had died before the launch the first 11 luna missions were unsuccessful for a variety of reasons at that time the project was transferred to lavochkin design bureau since okb-1 was busy with a manned expedition to the moon luna 9 was the twelfth attempt at a soft-landing by the soviet union it was also the first successful deep space probe built by the lavochkin design bureau which ultimately would design and build almost all soviet later russian lunar and interplanetary spacecraft all operations prior to landing occurred without fault and the 58-centimetre 23in spheroid als capsule landed on the moon at 184530 ut on 3 february 1966 west of the craters reiner and marius in the ocean of storms at 78 north latitude and 6422 west longitude approximately five minutes after touchdown luna 9 began transmitting data to earth but it was seven hours after the sun had climbed to 7 elevation before the probe began sending the first of nine images including five panoramas of the surface of the moon surface operations approximately 250 seconds after landing in the oceanus procellarum four petals which covered the top half of the spacecraft opened outward for increased stability the television camera system began a photographic survey of the lunar environment seven radio sessions with a total of 8 hours and 5 minutes were transmitted as well as three series of tv pictures after assembly the photographs gave a panoramic view of the immediate lunar surface comprising views of nearby rocks and of the horizon 14 kilometres 087mi away the pictures from luna 9 were not released immediately by the soviet authorities but scientists at jodrell bank observatory in england which was monitoring the craft noticed that the signal format used was identical to the internationally agreed radiofax system used by newspapers for transmitting pictures the daily express rushed a suitable receiver to the observatory and the pictures from luna 9 were decoded and published worldwide the bbc speculated that the spacecrafts designers deliberately fitted the probe with equipment conforming to the standard to enable reception of the pictures by jodrell bank the radiation detector the only scientific instrument on board measured a dosage of 30 millirads 03 milligrays per day the mission also determined that a spacecraft would not sink into the lunar dust that the ground could support a lander last contact with the spacecraft was at 2255 utc on 6 february 1966 sources spaceflight portal zarya - luna 9 chronology animation of
