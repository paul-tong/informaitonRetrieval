thomas digges dz c 1546 24 august 1595 was an english mathematician and astronomer he was the first to expound the copernican system in english but discarded the notion of a fixed shell of immoveable stars to postulate infinitely many stars at varying distances he was also first to postulate the dark night sky paradox life thomas digges born about 1546 was the son of leonard digges c 1515 c 1559 the mathematician and surveyor and bridget wilford the daughter of thomas wilford esquire of hartridge in cranbrook kent by his first wife elizabeth culpeper the daughter of walter culpeper esquire

second husband was john weston after the death of his father digges grew up under the guardianship of john dee a typical renaissance natural philosopher in 1583 lord burghley appointed digges with john chamber and henry savile to sit on a commission to consider whether england should adopt the gregorian calendar as proposed by dee digges served as a member of parliament for wallingford and also had a military career as a muster-master general to the english forces from 1586 to 1594 during the war with the spanish netherlands digges died on 24 august 1595 his last will in which he

by tycho brahe and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the moon this contradicted aristotles view of the universe according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars in 1576 he published a new edition of his fathers perpetual almanac a prognostication everlasting the text written by leonard digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged but thomas added new material in several appendices the most important of these was a perfit description of the caelestiall orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the pythagoreans latelye revived by copernicus and by geometricall demonstrations approved contrary to the ptolemaic cosmology of the original book by his father the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known copernican heliocentric model of the universe this was the first publication of that model in english and a milestone in the popularisation of science for the most part the appendix was a loose translation into english of chapters from copernicus book de revolutionibus orbium coelestium thomas digges went further than copernicus however by proposing that the universe is infinite containing infinitely many stars and may have been the first person to do so according to harrison copernicus had said little or nothing about what lay beyond the sphere of fixed stars diggess original contribution to cosmology consisted of dismantling the starry sphere and scattering the stars throughout endless space by grafting endless space onto the copernican system and scattering the stars throughout this endless space digges pioneered the idea of an unlimited universe filled with the mingling rays of countless stars an illustration of the copernican universe can be seen at right the outer inscription on the map reads after spelling adjustments from elizabethan to modern english this orb of stars fixed infinitely up extends itself in altitude spherically and therefore immovable the palace of felicity garnished with perpetual shining glorious lights innumerable far excelling our sun both in quantity and quality the very court of celestial angels devoid of grief and replenished with perfect endless joy the habitacle for the elect sources and further reading edwards david 2004 st leger sir warham 15251597 oxford dictionary of national biography online ed oxford
