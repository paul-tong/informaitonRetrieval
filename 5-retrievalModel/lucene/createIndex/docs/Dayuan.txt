dayuan ta-yuan old chinese reconstructed pronunciation dhats wan middle chinese reconstructed pronunciation according to edwin g pulleyblank daj uan chinese pinyin dyun wadegiles ta-yuan literally great ionians was a country in ferghana valley in central asia described in the chinese historical works of records of the grand historian and the book of han it is mentioned in the accounts of the famous chinese explorer zhang qian in 130 bce and the numerous embassies that followed him into central asia the country of dayuan is generally accepted as relating to the ferghana valley and its greek city alexandria eschate modern khujand tajikistan these chinese accounts describe the dayuan as urbanized dwellers with caucasian features living in walled cities and having customs identical to those of the greco-bactrians a hellenistic kingdom that was ruling bactria at that time in todays northern afghanistan the dayuan are also described as manufacturers and great lovers of wine the dayuan were the descendants of the greek colonists that were settled by alexander the great in ferghana in 329 bce see alexandria eschate and prospered within the hellenistic realm of the seleucids and greco-bactrians until they were isolated by the migrations of the yuezhi around 160 bce it appears that the name yuan was simply a transliteration of sanskrit yavana or pali yona used throughout antiquity in asia to designate greeks ionians so that dayuan would mean great ionians the interaction between the dayuan and the chinese is historically crucial since it represents one of the first major contacts between an urbanized western civilization and the chinese civilization opening the way to the formation of the silk road that was to link the east and the west in material and cultural exchange from the 1st century bce to the 15th century hellenistic rule 329160 bce the region of ferghana was conquered by alexander the great in 329 bce and became his most advanced base in central asia he founded the fortified city of alexandria eschate lit alexandria the furthest in the southwestern part of the ferghana valley on the southern bank of the river syr darya ancient jaxartes at the location of the modern city of khujand also called khozdent formerly leninabad in the state of tajikistan alexander built a 6 kilometer long brick wall around the city and as similarly in the cases of the other cities he founded had a garrison of his retired veterans and wounded settle there the whole of bactria transoxiana and the area of ferghana remained under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire until 250 bce the region then wrested independence under the leadership of its greek governors diodotus of bactria to become the greco-bactrian kingdom greco-bactrian kingdom 250160 bce the greco-bactrians held their territory and according to the greek historian strabo even went beyond alexandria eschate and extended their empire as far as the seres and the phryni strabo xixii there are indications that they may have led expeditions as far as kashgar in xinjiang leading to the first known contacts between china and the west around 200 bc various statuettes and representations of greek soldiers have been found north of the tien shan and are today on display in the museum of urumqi boardman around 160 bc the area of ferghana seems to have been invaded by saka tribes called the sai-wang by the chinese the sai-wang originally settled in the ili valley in the general area of lake issyk kul were retreating southward after having been dislodged by yuezhi who themselves were fleeing from the xiongnu the yuezhi attacked the king of the sai sai-wang who moved a considerable distance to the south and the yuezhi then occupied his lands the sakas occupied the greek territory of dayuan benefiting from the fact that the greco-bactrians were fully occupied with conflicts in india against the indo-greeks and could hardly defend their northern provinces according to w w tarn the remaining of the sai-wang tribes apparently seized the greek province of ferghana it was easy at this time to occupy ferghana eucratides had just overthrown the euthydemid dynasty he himself was with his army in india and in 159 he met his death heliocles preoccupied first with the recovery of bactria and then with the invasion of india must have let this outlying province go saka rule 160 bce onward when the chinese envoy zhang qian described dayuan around 128 bce he mentioned besides the flourishing urban civilization warriors shooting arrows on horseback a probable description of saka nomad warriors dayuan had probably by then become a kingdom of nomadic people exacting tribute from the local urbanized hellenistic population also in 106101 bce during their conflict with china the country of dayuan is said to have been an ally with the neighbouring tribes of kangju probably sodgia the chinese also record the name of the king of dayuan as mu-kua a saka name rendered in greek as mauakes or maues another scythian ruler by the name of maues was later a ruler of the indo-scythian kingdom in northern india during the 1st century bce yuezhi migration according to the han chronicles in 132bce the yuezhi were driven out of the ili river valley by the wusun they fled south from the ili river area by-passed the urban civilization of the dayuan in ferghana and re-settled north of the oxus in bactria definitively cutting dayuan from contact with the greco-bactrian kingdom the yuezhi would further expand southward into bactria proper around 125 bce and then going on to form the kushan empire in the 1st century ce interaction with china 130 bce onward the dayuan remained a healthy and powerful civilization which had numerous contacts and exchanges with china from 130 bce zhang qians report around 130 bce at the time of zhang qians embassy to central asia the dayuan were described as inhabitants of a region corresponding to the ferghana far to the west of the chinese empire the capital of the kingdom of dayuan is the city of guishan khujand distant from changan 12550 li shiji123 calls the capital ershi the kingdom contains 60000 families comprising a population of 300000 with 60000 trained troops a viceroy and a national assistant prince the seat of the governor general lies to the east at a distance of 4031 li to their south-west were the territories of the yuezhi with the greco-bactrians further south still beyond the oxus the great yueh-chih is situated about 2000 or 3000 li west of dayuan they dwell north of the river kuei oxus to the south of them there is daxia bactrians to the west anxis parthians to the north kangju sogdians the shiji then explains that the yuezhi originally inhabited the hexi corridor before they were defeated by the xiongnu under mao-tun and later his son in 176 bce forcing them to go beyond the territory of the dayuan and resettle in the west by the banks of the oxus between the territory of the dayuan and bactria to the south urbanized city-dwellers the customs of the dayuan are said by zhang qian to be identical to those of the bactrians in the south who actually formed the greco-bactrian kingdom at that time their customs the bactrians are the same as those of dayuan the people have fixed abodes and live in walled cities and regular houses like the people of dayuan they have no great kings or heads but everywhere in their walled cities and settlements they have installed small kings they are described as town-dwellers as opposed to other populations such as the yuezhi the wusun or the xiongnu who were nomads they have walled cities and houses the large and small cities belonging to them fully seventy in number contain an aggregate population of several hundreds of thousandsthere are more than seventy other cities in the country appearance and culture the shiji comments on the caucasian-like appearance and the culture of the people around dayuan although the states from dayuan west to anxi speak rather different languages their customs are generally similar and their languages mutually intelligible the men all have deep-set eyes and profuse beards and whiskers they are skillful at commerce and will haggle over a fraction of a cent women are held in great respect and the men make decisions on the advice of their women they were great manufacturers and lovers of wine round about dayuan they make wine from grapes wealthy people store up as much as 10000 stones and over in their cellars and keep it for several tens of years without spoiling the people are fond of wine according to the shiji grapes and alfalfa were introduced to china from dayuan following zhang qians embassy the regions around dayuan make wine out of grapes the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as 10000 or more piculs stored away it can be kept for as long as twenty or thirty years without spoiling the people love their wine and the horses love their alfalfa the han envoys brought back grape and alfalfa seeds to china and the emperor for the first time tried growing these plants in areas of rich soil later when the han acquired large numbers of the heavenly horses and the envoys from foreign states began to arrive with their retinues the lands on all sides of the emperors summer palaces and pleasure towers were planted with grapes and alfalfa for as far as the eye could see the shiji also claims that metal casting was introduced to the dayuan region by han deserters the casting of coins and vessels was formerly unknown later however when some of the chinese soldiers attached to the han embassies ran away and surrendered to the people of the area they taught them how to cast metal and manufacture weapons relations with china following the reports of zhang qian who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the yuezhi against the xiongnu in vain the chinese emperor wudi became interested in developing commercial relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of ferghana bactria and parthia the son of heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus ferghana dayuan and the possessions of bactria and parthia are large countries full of rare things with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the chinese people but with weak armies and placing great value on the rich produce of china shiji 123 the chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies around ten every year to these countries and as far as seleucid syria thus more embassies were dispatched to an-si parthia an-tsai the aorsi or alans li-kan syria under the seleucids tiau-chi chaldea and shon-tu india as a rule rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year and at the least five or six shiji 123 the chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses heavenly horses in the possession of the dayuan which were of capital importance to fight the nomad xiongnu the refusal of the dayuan to offer them enough horses along with a series of conflicts and mutual disrespect resulted in the death of the chinese ambassador and the confiscation of the gold sent as payment for the horses enraged and thinking dayuan weak the chinese emperor in 104 bce sent out li guangli the brother of his favorite concubine he was given 6000 horsemen and 30000 young men of bad reputation rounded up from the provinces general li lost many men along the way in petty fights with local rulers after a severe defeat at a place called yucheng li concluded that he was not strong enough to take the enemy capital and therefore returned to dunhuang about 102 bc emperor wudi responded by giving li guangli a much larger army along with a huge number of oxen donkeys and camels to carry supplies with this force he had no difficulty reaching ershi the dayuan capital after a 40-day siege the chinese had broken through the outer wall and cut off the water supply the nobles of ershi killed their king and sent his head to li guangli offering the chinese all the horses they wanted li accepted the offer appointed one of the nobles to be the new king and withdrew with the horses on his return journey all the petty states accepted chinese sovereignty he reached the jade gate about 100 bc with 10000 men and 1000 horses contacts with the west were re-established following the peace treaty with the yuan ambassadors were once again sent to the west caravans were sent to bactria an era of east-west trade and cultural exchange the silk road essentially came into being from the 1st century bce following the efforts of china to consolidate a road to the western world both through direct settlements in the area of the tarim basin and diplomatic relations with the countries of the dayuan parthians and bactrians further west intense trade followed soon confirmed by the roman craze for chinese silk supplied by the parthians from the 1st century bc to the point that the senate issued in vain several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk on economic and moral grounds this is attested by at least three significant authors strabo 64 63 bcec 24 ce seneca
