charles douard guillaume 15 february 1861 fleurier switzerland 13 may 1938 svres france was a swiss physicist who received the nobel prize in physics in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys in 1919 he gave the fifth guthrie lecture at the institute of physics in london with the title the anomaly of the nickel-steels guillaume is known for his discovery of nickel-steel alloys he named invar and elinvar invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature such as the marine chronometer elinvar is also non-magnetic which is a secondary useful property for antimagnetic watches guillaume is also known for the earliest estimation of the radiation of the stars in his 1896 paper la temprature de lespace the temperature of space this is the first known reference to the concept that would later be known as the cosmic microwave background as the son of a swiss horologist guillaume took an interest in marine chronometers for use as the compensation balance he developed a slight variation of the invar alloy which had a negative quadratic coefficient of expansion the purpose of doing this was to eliminate the middle temperature error of the balance wheel guillaume was head of the international bureau of weights and measures he worked with kristian birkeland serving at the observatoire de parissection de meudon he conducted several experiments with thermostatic measurements at the observatory he was the first to determine accurately the temperature of space guillaume was married in 1888 to am taufflieb with whom he had three children publications guillaume charles-edouard 1896 la temprature de lespace the temperature of space la nature 24 archived from the original on 2012-07-16 guillaume charles-edouard 1886 tudes thermomtriques studies on thermometry guillaume charles-edouard 1889 trait de thermomtrie treatise on thermometry guillaume charles-edouard 1894 units et talons units and standards guillaume charles douard 1896 les rayons x x-rays guillaume charles douard 1898 recherches sur le nickel et ses alliages investigations on nickel and its alloys guillaume charles douard 1899 la vie de la matire the life of matter guillaume charles douard 1902 la convention du mtre et le bureau international des poids et mesures metrical convention and the international bureau of weights and measures guillaume charles douard 1904 les applications des aciers au nickel applications of nickel-steels guillaume charles douard 1907 des tats de la matire states of matter guillaume charles douard 1913 1907 les rcents progrs du systme mtrique recent progress in the metric system guillaume charles douard initiation la mcanique introduction to mechanics notes nobel lectures physics 1901-1921 charles-edouard guillaume biography elsevier publishing company amsterdam lanlgov history pioneers in the development of the plasma universe rupert thomas gould the marine chronometer its history and development holland press 1960 robert w cahn 2005 an unusual nobel prize notes and records 592 works by or about charles douard guillaume at internet archive nobelprizeorg biography charles douard guillaume
