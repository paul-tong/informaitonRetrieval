christopher columbus kraft jr born february 28 1924 is an american aerospace engineer and retired nasa engineer and manager who was instrumental in establishing the agencys mission control operation following his graduation from virginia tech in 1944 kraft was hired by the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca the predecessor organization to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa he worked for over a decade in aeronautical research before being asked in 1958 to join the space task group a small team entrusted with the responsibility of putting americas first man in space assigned to the flight operations division kraft became nasas first flight director he was on duty during such historic missions as americas first manned spaceflight first manned orbital flight and first spacewalk at the beginning of the apollo program kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning in 1972 he became director of the manned spacecraft center later johnson space center following in the footsteps of his mentor robert r gilruth he held the position until his 1982 retirement from nasa during his retirement kraft has consulted for numerous companies including ibm and rockwell international and he published an autobiography entitled flight my life in mission control more than any other person kraft was responsible for shaping the organization and culture of nasas mission control as his protg glynn lunney commented the control center today is a reflection of chris kraft in 2011 the mission control center building was named after him when kraft received the national space trophy from the rotary club in 1999 the organization described him as a driving force in the us human space flight program from its beginnings to the space shuttle era a man whose accomplishments have become legendary early life and education born in phoebus virginia on february 28 1924 kraft was named after his father christopher columbus kraft who was born in new york city in 1892 near the newly renamed columbus circle krafts father the son of bavarian immigrants had found his name an embarrassment but passed it along to his son nonetheless in later years kraftas well as other commentatorswould consider it peculiarly appropriate kraft commented in his autobiography that with the choice of his name some of my lifes direction was settled from the start as a boy kraft played in an american legion drum-and-bugle corps and became the state champion bugler he was also a keen baseball player and continued to play baseball in college one year he had a batting average of 340 in 1942 kraft began his studies at virginia tech and became a member of the corps of cadets during his freshman year he attempted to enlist in the military as a us navy cadet but was rejected because of a burned right hand that he had suffered at age three because of wartime demands virginia tech was operating on a twelve-month schedule and kraft finished his degree in only two years he graduated in december 1944 with a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering naca career on graduation kraft accepted a job with the chance vought aircraft company in connecticut he had also sent an application to the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca a government agency whose langley research center was located in hampton virginia kraft considered it to be too close to home but applied as insurance on arrival at chance vought he was told that he could not be hired without his birth certificate which he had not brought with him annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company he decided to accept the offer from naca instead in the 1940s naca was a research and development organization devoted to cutting-edge aeronautical research at the langley research center advanced wind tunnels were used to test new aircraft designs and studies were taking place on new concepts such as the x-1 rocket plane kraft was assigned to the flight research division where gilruth was then head of research his work with naca included the development of an early example of gust alleviation system for an aircraft flying in turbulent air this involved correcting for variations in the atmosphere by automatically deflecting the control surfaces he also discovered that wingtip vortices and not prop-wash are responsible for most of the turbulence in the air that trails flying aircraft this finding was forgotten and later rediscovered independently although he enjoyed his work kraft found it increasingly stressful especially since he did not consider himself to be a strong theoretician in 1956 he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started thinking about a change of career flight director flight operations in 1957 the russian flight of sputnik 1 prompted the united states to accelerate its fledgling space program on july 29 1958 president dwight d eisenhower signed the national aeronautics and space act which established nasa and subsumed naca within this newly created organization langley research center became a part of nasa as did langley employees such as kraft even before nasa began its official existence in october kraft was invited by gilruth to become a part of a new group that was working on the problems of putting a man into orbit without much hesitation he accepted the offer when the space task group was officially formed on november 5 kraft became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to project mercury americas man-in-space program as a member of the space task group kraft was assigned to the flight operations division which made plans and arrangements for the operation of the mercury spacecraft during flight and for the control and monitoring of missions from the ground kraft became the assistant to chuck mathews the head of the division and was given the responsibility of putting together a mission plan given mathews casual analysis of the problem it almost sounded simple chris you come up with a basic mission plan you know the bottom-line stuff on how we fly a man from a launch pad into space and back again it would be good if you kept him alive however when kraft began to plan nasas flight operations no human being had yet flown in space in fact the task before him was vast requiring attention to flight plans timelines procedures mission rules spacecraft tracking telemetry ground support telecommunications networks and contingency management one of krafts most important contributions to manned spaceflight would be his origination of the concept of a mission control center many of the engineers in project mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft where the role for ground support was minimal however kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much particularly during the fast-moving launch phase the mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers i saw a team of highly skilled engineers each one an expert on a different piece of the mercury capsule wed have a flow of accurate telemetry data so the experts could monitor their systems see and even predict problems and pass along instructions to the astronaut these concepts shaped the mercury control center which was located at cape canaveral in florida another important concept pioneered by kraft was the idea of the flight director the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission as mathews later recalled kraft came to him one day saying there needs to be someone in charge of the flights while theyre actually going on and i want to be that person in this informal way the position of flight director was born a pivotal experience for kraft was the flight of mercury-atlas 5 which sent a chimpanzee named enos on the first american orbital spaceflight carrying a live passenger coverage of these early missions that carried non-human passengers could often be tongue-in-cheek a time magazine article on the flight for example was titled meditative chimponaut yet kraft viewed them as important tests for the men and procedures of mission control and as rehearsals for the manned missions that would follow originally the flight of mercury-atlas 5 had been intended to last for three orbits however the failure of one of the hydrogen peroxide jets controlling the spacecrafts attitude forced kraft to make the decision to bring the capsule back to earth after two orbits after the flight astronaut john glenn stated that he believed a human passenger would have been able to bring the capsule under control without the need for an early re-entry thus in the words of time magazine affirming the superiority of astronauts over chimponauts yet for kraft the flight of enos represented proof of the importance of real-time decision-making in mission control it also gave him his first experience of the responsibility that he as flight director would have for the life of another whether human or chimpanzee mercury kraft served as flight director during all six of the manned mercury missions only during the final flightmercury-atlas 9 which lasted for over a daydid he share responsibility with his deputy john hodge mercury-atlas 6 the flight of john glenn proved to be a testing experience both for mission control and for kraft one book on the history of the apollo program calls it the single event that decisively shaped flight operations the mission the first orbital flight by an american unfolded normally until glenn began his second orbit at that point krafts systems controller don arabian reported that telemetry was showing a segment 51 indicator this suggested that the capsules landing bag which was meant to deploy upon splashdown in order to provide a cushion might have deployed early kraft believed that the segment 51 indicator was due to faulty instrumentation rather than to an actual early deployment however if he was wrong it would mean that the capsules heat shield which fitted on top of the landing bag was now loose a loose heat shield could cause the capsule to burn up during re-entry on consulting with his flight controllers kraft became convinced that the indication was false and that no action was needed however his superiors including mercury capsule designer max faget felt differently they overruled kraft telling him to instruct glenn to leave the capsules retrorocket package on during re-entry the reasoning was that the package which was strapped over the heatshield would hold the heatshield in place if it was loose kraft however felt that this was an unacceptable risk i was aghast he remembered if any of three retrorockets had solid fuel remaining an explosion could rip everything apart yet he agreed to follow the plan advocated by faget and by walt williams his superior in the flight operations division the retrorockets would be kept on glenn landed safely but an inspection of his capsule revealed that one of the landing bag switches had been faulty kraft was right the heat shield had not been loose after all the lessons that he drew from this experience were clear my flight controllers and i were a lot closer to the systems and to events than anyone in top management from now on i swore theyd pay hell before they overruled any decision i made his assistant on the mission gene kranz considered glenns flight the turning point in krafts evolution as a flight director before the flight of mercury-atlas 7 kraft had objected to the choice of scott carpenter as the astronaut for the mission telling walt williams that carpenters lack of engineering skills might put the mission or his own life in danger the mission suffered from problems including an unusually high rate of fuel usage a malfunctioning horizon indicator a delayed retrofire for re-entry and a splashdown that was 250 nautical miles 460km downrange from the target area throughout the mission kraft found himself frustrated by the vagueness of carpenters communications with mission control and what he perceived as carpenters inattention to his duties part of the problem he recalled was that carpenter either didnt understand or was ignoring my instructions while some of these problems were due to mechanical failures and responsibility for some of the others is still being debated kraft did not hesitate to assign blame to carpenter and continued to speak out about the mission for decades afterwards his autobiography written in 2001 reopened the issue the chapter that dealt with the flight of mercury-atlas 7 was titled the man malfunctioned in a letter to the new york times carpenter called the book vindictive and skewed and offered a different assessment of the reasons for krafts frustration in space things happen so fast that only the pilot knows what to do and even ground control cant help maybe thats why he is still fuming after all these years at the end of the mercury program kraft was invited to attend a ceremony in the white house rose garden where he received the nasa outstanding leadership medal it was awarded by president john f kennedy and nasa administrator james webb none of us have many days in our lives like that one kraft remembered gemini during the gemini program krafts role changed again he was now the head of mission operations in charge of a team of flight directors although still also serving as a flight director himself due to the greater length of gemini missions mission control was now manned on a three-shift basis clearly with flight control facing a learning curve space historian david harland has said these arrangements were an experiment in their own right yet kraft proved to be remarkably successful at passing on responsibility to his fellow flight directorsarguably too successful as gene kranz found during his first shift handover on gemini 4 as kranz recalled he just said youre in charge and walked out the gemini program represented a string of firsts for nasathe first flight with two astronauts the first rendezvous in space the first spacewalkand kraft was on duty during many of these historic events americas first spacewalk happened during the gemini 4 mission kraft at his console found that he had to force himself to concentrate on his work distracted by ed whites mesmerizing descriptions of the earth below he could easily understand the euphoria that white felt at the spectacle yet he also was mindful of the discipline required to keep the flight safe white delayed his return to the capsule and a communication problem prevented capsule communicator gus grissom from getting the crew to hear the order to terminate the spacewalk when contact was finally re-established kraft expressed his frustration on his ground loop to grissom the flight director says get back in after gemini 7 kraft stepped back from his work at mission control allowing other flight directors to take charge of the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the apollo program he served on two review boards at north american aviation the contractor responsible for the apollo capsule yet kraft still felt pangs at not being at the center of the action particularly after the emergency re-entry of gemini 8 both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions but as kraft confessed to robert gilruth he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot apollo 1 fire with the beginning of the apollo program kraft expected to return to his role in mission control he would have been lead flight director on the first manned apollo mission later known as apollo 1 which was scheduled to launch in early 1967 however on january 27 1967 the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad at the time of the fire kraft was in mission control but under the circumstances there was little he could do he was asked by betty grissom the widow of astronaut gus grissom to be one of the pallbearers at grissoms funeral at arlington national cemetery public profile during the sixties kraft was a household name in america he appeared on the cover of the august 27 1965 issue of time magazine in which he was profiled as the conductor in a command post in his interview with time kraft compared himself with namesake christopher columbus displaying what the magazine described as an almost angry pride in his work we know a lot more about what we have to do than he did kraft said and we know where were going the article described krafts role in the gemini 5 mission and drew on krafts frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor the conductor cant play all the instruments--he may not even be able to play any one of them but he knows when the first violin should be playing and he knows when the trumpets should be loud or soft and when the drummer should be drumming he mixes all this up and out comes music thats what we do here kraft had originally been surprised at time magazines decision to put him on the cover telling the nasa public affairs officer that theyve got the wrong guy it should be bob gilruth not me however he eventually came to terms with the idea and the portrait that was painted for the cover became one of his prized possessions relations with astronaut corps after john glenns flight kraft had vowed that he would no longer allow his decisions as flight director to be overruled by anyone outside mission control the mission rules whose drafting had been overseen by kraft stated that the flight director may after analysis of the flight choose to take any necessary action required for the successful completion of the mission for kraft the power that the flight director held over every aspect of the mission extended to his control over the actions of the astronauts in his 1965 interview with time magazine he stated the guy on the ground ultimately controls the mission theres no question about that in my mind or in the astronauts minds they are going to do what he says occasionally kraft intervened in order to ensure that his conception of the flight directors authority was maintained by the time that the apollo 7 mission flew he had been promoted to head of the flight operations division thus it was glynn lunney who served as lead flight director and had to deal directly with behavior by the crew that kraft considered insubordinate as kraft commented in his memoirs it was like having a ringside seat at the wally schirra bitch circus mission commander wally schirra annoyed by last-minute changes in the crews schedule and suffering from a bad cold repeatedly refused to accept orders from the ground although schirras actions were successful in the short term kraft decreed in consultation with astronaut chief deke slayton that none of the apollo 7 crew would fly again however schirra had decided before the flight that he would retire after apollo 7 kraft had made a similar pronouncement before in the case of astronaut scott carpenter after carpenters troubled mercury mission kraft wrote i swore an oath that scott carpenter would never again fly in space the result he didnt manager and mentor apollo mission planning after the apollo 1 fire in 1967 kraft had reluctantly concluded that his responsibilities as a manager would keep him from serving as a flight director on the next manned mission apollo 7 and on missions thereafter henceforth his involvement in the apollo program would be at a higher level as the director of flight operations kraft was closely involved in planning the broad outlines of the program he was one of the first nasa managers to become involved in the decision to send apollo 8 on a circumlunar flight due to problems with lunar module development in 1968 nasa faced the possibility of a full apollo test mission being delayed until 1969 as a substitute george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office came up with the idea of assigning a new mission profile to apollo 8 one that could be flown without the lunar module the idea was discussed in early august at a meeting between low kraft gilruth and deke slayton the four of us had become an unofficial committee that got together often in bobs office to discuss problems plans and off-the-wall ideas not much happened in gemini or apollo that didnt either originate with us or with our input lows plan was to fly the mission in december which left little time for the flight operations division to train and prepare after agreeing that the mission was possible in principle kraft went to his mission planners and flight directors in order to determine whether they and their teams could be ready within the tight schedule that was projected my head was abuzz with the things wed have to do remembered kraft but it was one hell of a challenge on august 9 gilruth low kraft and slayton flew to marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama where they briefed nasa managers including wernher von braun and rocco petrone on the planned mission on august 14 they along with the huntsville group traveled to nasa headquarters in washington dc to brief deputy administrator thomas o paine in turn paine recommended the mission to administrator james e webb who gave kraft and his colleagues the authority to begin preparations for the mission in planning for apollo 8 one of the responsibilities kraft faced was ensuring that a fleet would be waiting to recover the crew when they splashed down at the end of the mission this proved an unusual challenge because much of the pacific fleet of the us navy would be on leave over the christmas and new years eve period kraft had to personally meet with admiral john mccain in order to persuade him to make the requisite resources available to nasa apollo missions on christmas eve 1968 apollo 8 went into orbit around the moon only ten years earlier kraft had joined gilruths newly founded space task group now the two men sat together in mission control reflecting on how far they had come around them the room was filled with cheers but kraft and gilruth celebrated more quietly it was glorious pandemonium and through the mist in my own eyes i saw bob gilruth wiping at his and hoping that no one saw him crying i put my hand on his arm and squeezed he lifted my hand from his arm and shook it strongly there were no words from either of us the lumps in our throats held them back kraft again found himself a spectator during the landing of apollo 11 which he viewed from mission control sitting with gilruth and george low he played a more active role in events during the unfolding of the apollo 13 crisis called into mission control by gene kranz almost immediately after the accident kraft chaired the meeting of senior managers which decided the mode that apollo 13 would use to return to earth mentor many apollo engineers later to become top managers themselves considered kraft to have been one of the best managers in the program he personally hand-picked and trained an entire generation of nasa flight directors including john hodge glynn lunney and gene kranz the last of whom referred to kraft simply as the teacher in the words of the space historians murray and cox kraft set the tone for one of the most striking features of flight operations unquestioning trustnot of superiors by subordinates but the other way around the principles that kraft had inculcated continued to have an impact at johnson space center long after he retired as glynn lunney reflected in 1998 he instilled a sense of what was right what was wrong what you had to do how good you had to be and those standards that he kind of inbred into everybody by his own example and by what he did with us continue today the control center today is a reflection of chris kraft kraft could however be a tough taskmaster making it clear that there was no place in the flight operations division for those who failed to live up to his exacting standards to err is human went one of his favorite sayings but to do so more than once is contrary to flight operations directorate policy subordinates who seriously displeased kraft could find themselves deprived of the opportunity to make it up to him kraft possessed the power to end careers at johnson space center as mission controller sy liebergot recalled if he was behind you you had as much leverage as you needed if he was against you you were dead meat center director in 1969 kraft was named deputy director of the manned spacecraft center msc on january 14 1972 he became the director of msc replacing gilruth for whom kraft had worked since his arrival at langley in 1945 space commentator anthony young has described kraft as a superb successor to gilruth second only to him in the history of center directors kraft was eligible to retire in the early 1980s but he chose not to take the option he remained as center director in the status of a reemployed annuitant receiving his government pension but still employed by nasa in 1981 he had been involved in a conflict with the nasa administrator and other top officials over the conduct of the sts-2 mission and over issues relating to nasa organization and management this contributed to making his position at nasa more tenuous in april 1982 kraft made what newspaper reports called a surprise announcement that he intended to step down as center director at the end of the year he denied that his resignation had anything to do with the threatened possibility of johnson space center losing its leading role in space shuttle operations or in the development of nasas space station freedom retirement consultant after his retirement kraft served as a consultant for companies including rockwell international and ibm and as director-at-large of the houston chamber of commerce in 1994 kraft was appointed chairman of the space shuttle management independent review team a panel made up of leading aerospace experts whose remit was to investigate ways in which nasa could make its space shuttle program more cost effective the panels report known as the kraft report was published in february 1995 it recommended that nasas space shuttle operations should be outsourced to a single private contractor and that nasa should consider progression towards the privatization of the space shuttle it also criticized the effect of safety changes made by nasa after the challenger accident saying that they had created a safety environment that is duplicative and expensive fundamental to the report was the idea that the shuttle had become a mature and reliable system about as safe as todays technology will provide the report was controversial even at the time of its publication john pike space policy director for the federation of american scientists commented that the kraft report is a recipe for disaster they are basically saying dismantle the safety and quality assurance mechanisms set in place after the challenger accident nasas aerospace safety advisory panel also took issue with the report saying in may 1995 that the assumption that the space shuttle systems are now mature smacks of a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps nonetheless nasa accepted the recommendations of the report and in november 1995 responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the united space alliance nine years later the kraft report was again criticized this time by the columbia accident investigation board caib as part of its consideration of the organizational and cultural causes of the columbia accident the report it said characterized the space shuttle program in a way that the board judges to be at odds with the realities of the shuttle program according to the caib the kraft report had contributed to the undesirable safety culture within nasa allowing nasa to view the shuttle as an operationalrather than experimentalvehicle and distracting attention from continuing engineering anomalies autobiography in 2001 kraft published his autobiography flight my life in mission control it dealt with his life up until the end of the apollo program only briefly mentioning his time as center director in the epilogue the book was generally well-reviewed in a the new york times review space writer henry s f cooper jr called it a highly readable memoir while the kirkus review summed it up as a snappy highly detailed account of 20th century americas most dramatic technological achievement reviewers almost unanimously commented on the outspokenness of krafts storytelling and his readiness to personally criticize those with whom he had disagreed cooper noted that kraft pulls no punches about some of his colleagues shortcomings and kliatt magazine said that he isnt afraid to name names personal life since 1950 kraft has been married to betty anne kraft formerly turnbull whom he met in high school they have two children gordon and kristi-anne in his autobiography kraft recognizes the sacrifices that his family made as a result of his work for nasa saying that i was more of a remote authority figure to gordon and kristi-anne than a typical american father kraft is an episcopalian serving as a lay reader at his local church during the sixties the kraft family was deeply involved in church activities betty anne taught sunday school and served on the altar guild gordon was an acolyte and kristi-anne sang in the choir in addition to his duties as a lay reader kraft spent some time teaching a class in adult bible study as he recounts however i lacked the fundamentalist verve and drove people away when i tried too hard to relate the early church to more modern interpretations it was hard not to be modern when i spent my working days sending men into space kraft has been an avid golfer ever since he was introduced to the game in the 1940s by his friend and nasa colleague sig sjoberg he cited the good golfing as a reason for staying in houston after his retirement awards and honors kraft has received numerous awards and honors for his work these include the nasa outstanding leadership medal four nasa distinguished service medals the distinguished citizen award given to him by the city of hampton virginia in 1966 the john j montgomery award in 1963 and the goddard memorial trophy awarded by the national space club in 1979 in 1999 kraft received the national space trophy from the rotary national award for space achievement foundation which described him as a driving force in the us human space flight program from its beginnings to the space shuttle era a man whose accomplishments have become legendary in 2006 nasa gave kraft the ambassador of exploration award which carried with it a sample of lunar material brought back by apollo 11 kraft in turn presented the award to his alma mater virginia tech for display in its college of engineering in 2011 the johnson space center renamed its mission control center the christopher c kraft jr mission control center in his honor kraft elementary school located in hampton virginia near krafts hometown was named for him it was announced that kraft would be inducted into the national aviation hall of fame on october 1 2016 in films kraft was portrayed by stephen root in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon he has been interviewed in numerous documentaries about the space program including apollo 13 to the edge and back pbs failure is not an option history channel when we left earth discovery channel live from the moon spacecraft films and
