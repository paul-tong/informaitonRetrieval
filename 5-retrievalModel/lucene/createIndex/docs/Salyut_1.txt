salyut 1 dos-1 russian -1 english translation salute 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low earth orbit by the soviet union on april 19 1971 the salyut program followed this with five more successful launches out of seven more stations the final module of the program zvezda dos-8 became the core of the russian segment of the international space station and remains in orbit background salyut 1 originated as a modification of the military almaz space station program then in development after the landing of apollo 11 on the moon in july 1969 the soviets began shifting the primary emphasis of their manned space program to orbiting space stations with a possible lunar landing later in the 1970s if the n-1 booster became flight-worthy it did not one other motivation for the space station program was a desire to one-up the us skylab program then in development the basic structure of salyut 1 was adapted from the almaz with a few modifications and would form the basis of all soviet space stations through mir civilian soviet space stations were internally referred to as dos the russian acronym for long-duration orbital station although publicly the salyut name was used for the first six dos stations mir was internally known as dos-7 several military experiments were nonetheless carried on salyut 1 including the od-4 optical visual ranger the orion ultraviolet instrument for characterizing rocket exhaust plumes and the highly classified svinets radiometer construction and operational history construction of salyut 1 began in early 1970 and after nearly a year it was shipped to the baikonur cosmodrome some remaining assembly work had yet to be done and this was completed at the launch center the salyut programme was managed by kerim kerimov chairman of the state commission for soyuz missions launch was planned for april 12 1971 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of yuri gagarins flight on vostok 1 but technical problems delayed it until the 19th the first crew launched later in the soyuz 10 mission but they ran into troubles while docking and were unable to enter the station the soyuz 10 mission was aborted and the crew returned safely to earth a replacement crew launched in soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 days this was the first time in the history of spaceflight that a space station had been manned and a new record time was set in space this success was however short-lived when the crew was killed during re-entry as a pressure-equalization valve in the soyuz 11 re-entry capsule had opened prematurely causing the crew to asphyxiate after this accident all missions were suspended while the soyuz spacecraft was redesigned the station was intentionally destroyed by de-orbiting after six months in orbit because it ran out of fuel before a redesigned soyuz spacecraft could be launched to it structure at launch the announced purpose of salyut was to test the elements of the systems of a space station and to conduct scientific research and experiments the craft was described as being 20m 66ft in length 4m 13ft in maximum diameter and 99m 3500cuft in interior space with an on-orbit dry mass of 18425kg 40620lb of its several compartments three were pressurized 100m total and two could be entered by the crew transfer compartment the transfer compartment was equipped with the only docking port of salyut 1 which allowed one soyuz 7k-oks spacecraft to dock it was the first use of the soviet probe and drogue type docking system that allowed internal crew transfer a system that is in use today the docking cone had a 2m 66ft front diameter and a 3m 98ft aft diameter main compartment the second and main compartment was about 4m 13ft in diameter televised views showed enough space for eight big chairs seven at work consoles several control panels and 20 portholes some obstructed by instruments auxiliary compartments the third pressurized compartment contained the control and communications equipment the power supply the life support system and other auxiliary equipment the fourth and final unpressurized compartment was about 2m in diameter and contained the engine installations and associated control equipment salyut had buffer chemical batteries reserve supplies of oxygen and water and regeneration systems externally mounted were two double sets of solar cell panels that extended like wings from the smaller compartments at each end the heat regulation systems radiators and orientation and control devices salyut 1 was modified from one of the almaz airframes the unpressurized service module was the modified service module of a soyuz craft orion 1 space observatory the astrophysical orion 1 space observatory designed by grigor gurzadyan of byurakan observatory in armenia was installed in salyut 1 ultraviolet spectrograms of stars were obtained with the help of a mirror telescope of the mersenne system and a spectrograph of the wadsworth system using film sensitive to the far ultraviolet the dispersion of the spectrograph was 32mm 32nmmm while the resolution of the spectrograms derived was about 5 at 2600 05nm at 260nm slitless spectrograms were obtained of the stars vega and beta centauri between 2000 and 3800 200 and 380nm the telescope was operated by crew member viktor patsayev who became the first man to operate a telescope outside the earths atmosphere

missions 1 visiting spacecraft and crews soyuz 10 after taking 24h for rendezvous and approach soyuz 10 soft-docked with salyut at 0147 on april 24 utc and remained for 55h hard-docking was unsuccessful due to technical malfunctions the crew could not enter the station and had to abort the mission soyuz 11 soyuz 11 required 3 h 19 min on june 7 to complete docking the crew transferred to salyut and their mission was announced as checking the design units onboard systems and equipment of the orbital piloted station testing the stations manual and autonomous procedures for orientation and navigation as well as the control systems for maneuvering the space complex in orbit studying earths surface geology geography meteorology and snow and ice cover studying physical characteristics processes and phenomena in the atmosphere and outer space in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and conducting medico-biological studies to determine the feasibility of having cosmonauts in the station perform various tasks and studying the influence of space flight on the human organism on june 29 after 23 days and flying 362 orbits the mission was cut short due to problems aboard the station including an electrical fire the crew transferred back to soyuz 11 and reentered the earths atmosphere the capsule parachuted to a soft landing in kazakhstan but the recovery team opened the hatch to find all three crew members dead in their couches an inquest found that a pressure relief valve had malfunctioned during re-entry leading to a loss of cabin atmosphere the crew were not wearing pressure suits and it was decreed that all further soyuz missions would require the use of them re-entry salyut 1 was moved to a higher orbit in julyaugust 1971 to ensure that it would not be destroyed prematurely through orbital decay in the meantime soyuz capsules were being substantially re-designed to allow pressure suits to be worn during launch docking maneuvers and re-entry the soyuz redesign effort took too long however and by september salyut 1 was running low on attitude control gas it was decided to conclude the stations mission and on october 11 the main engines were fired for a deorbit maneuver after 175 days the worlds first space station burned up over the pacific ocean pravda october 26 1971 reported that 75 of salyut 1s studies were carried out by optical means and 20 by radio-technical means while the remainder involved magnetometrical gravitational or other measurements synoptic readings were taken in both the visible and invisible parts of the
