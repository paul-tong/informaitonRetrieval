atmospheric pressure sometimes also called barometric pressure after the sensor is the pressure within the atmosphere of earth or that of another planet the standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as 101325mbar 101325kpa equivalent to 760mmhg torr 299212incheshg or 14696psi the atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on earth that is the earths atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with si units of pascals 1 pascal 1 newton per square metre 1nm on average a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre cm measured from mean average sea level to the top of earths atmosphere has a mass of about 103 kilogram and exerts a force or weight of about 101 newtons or 237lbf resulting in a pressure at sea level of about 101 ncm or 101knm 101 kilopascals kpa a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1in 645cm would have a mass of about 665kg and a weight of about 654n or 147lbf resulting in a pressure of 101ncm or 147lbfin mechanism atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in composition mean sea-level pressure the mean sea-level pressure mslp is the average atmospheric pressure at mean sea level this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressure the altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment average sea-level pressure is 101325mbar 101325kpa 29921inhg 76000mmhg in aviation weather reports metar qnh is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals 1 hectopascal 1 millibar except in the united states canada and colombia where it is reported in inches of mercury to two decimal places the united states and canada also report sea-level pressure slp which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars however in canadas public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals in the us weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted 10132mbar 10132kpa is transmitted as 132 10000mbar 10000kpa is transmitted as 000 9987mbar is transmitted as 987 etc the highest sea-level pressure on earth occurs in siberia where the siberian high often attains a sea-level pressure above 1050mbar 105kpa 31inhg with record highs close to 1085mbar 1085kpa 320inhg the lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of tropical cyclones and tornadoes with a record low of 870mbar 87kpa 26inhg see atmospheric pressure records surface pressure surface pressure is the atmospheric pressure at a location on earths surface terrain and oceans it is directly proportional to the mass of air over that location for numerical reasons atmospheric models such as general circulation models gcms usually predict the nondimensional logarithm of surface pressure the average value of surface pressure on earth is 985 hpa this is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level the average pressure at mean sea-level msl in the international standard atmosphere isa is 101325 hpa or 1 atmosphere atm or 2992 inches of mercury pressure p mass m and the acceleration due to gravity g are related by p fa mga where a is surface area atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location altitude variation pressure on earth varies with the altitude of the surface so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level pressure varies smoothly from the earths surface to the top of the mesosphere although the pressure changes with the weather nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure the graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15c and a relative humidity of 0 at low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about 12kpa for every 100metres for higher altitudes within the troposphere the following equation the barometric formula relates atmospheric pressure p to altitude h where the constant parameters are as described below local variation atmospheric pressure varies widely on earth and these changes are important in studying weather and climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weather atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal twice-daily cycle caused by global atmospheric tides this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian 24h cycle and semi-circadian 12h cycle records the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth above 750 meters was 10848hpa 3203inhg measured in tosontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001 the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded below 750 meters was at agata in evenk autonomous okrug russia 6653n 9328e elevation 261m 856ft on 31 december 1968 of 10838hpa 32005inhg the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions assuming a standard lapse rate associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations the dead sea the lowest place on earth at 430 metres 1410ft below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065hpa the lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870hpa 0858atm 2569inhg set on 12 october 1979 during typhoon tip in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft measurement based on depth of water one atmosphere 101325kpa or 147psi is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 103m 338ft thus a diver 103m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres 1atm of air plus 1atm of water conversely 103m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditions low pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as wc water column gauge or wg inches water gauge a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14wg which is approximately 104837hpa similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly used boiling point of water pure water boils at 100c 212f at earths standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes or pressure cooking a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorers measurement and maps an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newtons theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of gravity and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter 328 feet this method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making this early application of science gave people insight into how science could easily be put to practical use see also underwater diving
