in epidemiology a risk factor is a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection when evidence is found the term determinant is used as a variable associated with either increased or decreased risk correlation vs causation risk factors or determinants are correlational and not necessarily causal because correlation does not prove causation for example being young cannot be said to cause measles but young people have a higher rate of measles because they are less likely to have developed immunity during a previous epidemic statistical methods are frequently used to assess the strength of an association and to provide causal evidence for example in the study of the link between smoking and lung cancer statistical analysis along with the biological sciences can establish that risk factors are causal some prefer the term risk factor to mean causal determinants of increased rates of disease and for unproven links to be called possible risks associations etc when done thoughtfully and based on research identification of risk factors can be a strategy for medical screening terms of description mainly taken from risk factors for breast cancer risk factors can be described in terms of for example relative risk such as a woman is more than 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer in her 60s than in her 20s fraction of incidences occurring in the group having the property of or being exposed to the risk factor such as 99 of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women increase in incidence in the exposed group such as each daily alcoholic beverage increases the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women hazard ratio such as an increase in both total and invasive breast cancers in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years with a hazard ratio of 124 compared to controls example the following example of a risk factor is described in terms of the relative risk it confers which is evaluated by comparing the risk of those exposed to the potential risk factor to those not exposed lets say that at a wedding 74 people ate the chicken and 22 of them were ill while of the 35 people who had the fish or vegetarian meal only 2 were ill did the chicken make the people ill so the chicken eaters risk 2274 0297 and non-chicken eaters risk 235 0057 those who ate the chicken had a risk over five times as high as those who did not that is a relative risk of more than five this suggests that eating chicken was the cause of the illness but this is not proof general determinants the probability of an outcome usually depends on an interplay between multiple associated variables when performing epidemiological studies to evaluate one or more determinants for a specific outcome the other determinants may act as confounding factors and need to be controlled for eg by stratification the potentially confounding determinants varies with what outcome is studied but the following general confounders are common to most epidemiological associations and are the determinants most commonly controlled for in epidemiological studies age 0 to 15 years for infants 15 to 6 years for young children etc sex or gender male or female ethnicity based on race other less commonly adjusted for possible confounders include social statusincome geographic location genetic predisposition gender identity occupation sexual orientation level of chronic stress diet level of physical exercise alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking other social determinants of health risk marker a risk marker is a variable that is quantitatively associated with a disease or other outcome but direct alteration of the risk marker does not necessarily alter the risk of the outcome for example driving-while-intoxicated dwi history is a risk marker for pilots as epidemiologic studies indicate that pilots with a dwi history are significantly more likely than their counterparts without a dwi history to be involved in aviation crashes history the term risk factor was first coined by former framingham heart study director dr william b kannel in a 1961 article in annals of internal medicine see also protective factor case sp and haines kr 2009 understanding youth offending risk factor research policy and practice cullompton willan httpwwwwillanpublishingcoukcgi-binindexerproduct9781843923411
