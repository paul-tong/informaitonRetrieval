the geomagnetic poles are antipodal points where the axis of a best-fitting dipole intersects the surface of earth this theoretical dipole is equivalent to a powerful bar magnet at the center of earth and comes closer than any other model to accounting for the magnetic field observed at earths surface in contrast the magnetic poles of the actual earth are not antipodal that is the line on which they lie does not pass through earths center owing to motion of fluid in the earths outer core the actual magnetic poles are constantly moving however over thousands of years their direction averages to the earths rotation axis on the order of once every half a million years the poles reverse north switches place with south definition as a first-order approximation the earths magnetic field can be modeled as a simple dipole like a bar magnet tilted about 96 with respect to the earths rotation axis which defines the geographic north and geographic south poles and centered at the earths center the north and south geomagnetic poles are the antipodal points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects the earths surface thus unlike the magnetic poles they always have an equal degree of latitude and supplementary degrees of longitude respectively 2017 lat 805n 805s long 728w 1072e if the earths magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the field lines would be vertical to the surface at the geomagnetic poles and they would coincide with the north and south magnetic poles however the approximation is imperfect and so the magnetic and geomagnetic poles lie some distance apart location like the north magnetic pole the north geomagnetic pole attracts the north pole of a bar magnet and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic south pole it is the center of the open magnetic field lines which connect to the interplanetary magnetic field and provide a direct route for the solar wind to reach the ionosphere as of 2015 it was located at approximately 8022n 7237w 8037n 7262w 8037 -7262 geomagnetic north pole 2015 est on ellesmere island nunavut canada the south geomagnetic pole is the point where the axis of this best-fitting tilted dipole intersects the earths surface in the southern hemisphere as of 2005 it was calculated to be located at 7974s 10822e near the vostok station because the earths actual magnetic field is not an exact dipole the calculated north and south geomagnetic poles do not coincide with the north and south magnetic poles if the earths magnetic fields were exactly dipolar the north pole of a magnetic compass needle would point directly at the north geomagnetic pole in practice it does not because the geomagnetic field that originates in the core has a more complex non-dipolar part and magnetic anomalies in the earths crust also contribute to the local field the locations of geomagnetic poles are calculated by the international geomagnetic reference field a statistical fit to measurements of the earths field by satellites and in geomagnetic observatories the geomagnetic poles are wandering for the same reason the magnetic poles wander movement the geomagnetic poles move over time because the geomagnetic field is produced by motion of the molten iron alloys in the earths outer core see geodynamo over the past 150 years the poles have moved westward at a rate of 005 to 01 per year with little net north or south motion over several thousand years the average location of the geomagnetic poles coincides with the geographical poles paleomagnetists have long relied on the geocentric axial dipole gad hypothesis which states that aside from during geomagnetic reversals the time-averaged position of the geomagnetic poles has always coincided with the geographic poles there is considerable paleomagnetic evidence supporting this hypothesis geomagnetic reversal over the life of the earth the orientation of earths magnetic field has reversed many times with geomagnetic north becoming geomagnetic south and vice versa an event known as a geomagnetic reversal evidence of geomagnetic reversals can be seen at mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates move apart as magma seeps out of the mantle and solidifies to become new ocean floor the magnetic minerals in it are magnetized in the direction of the magnetic field thus starting at the most recently formed ocean floor one can read out the direction of the magnetic field in previous times as one moves farther away to older ocean floor see also dipole model of the earths magnetic field notes mcelhinny michael w mcfadden phillip l 2000 paleomagnetism continents and oceans academic press isbn0-12-483355-1 merrill ronald t 2010 our magnetic earth the science of geomagnetism university of chicago press isbn0-226-52050-1 merrill ronald t mcelhinny michael w mcfadden phillip l 1996 the magnetic field of the earth paleomagnetism the core and the deep mantle academic press isbn978-0-12-491246-5 noaageomagnetic-related web resources
