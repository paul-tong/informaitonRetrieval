apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the moon commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin both american landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july 20 1969 at 2017 utc armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on july 21 at 025615 utc aldrin joined him 19 minutes later they spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft and collected 475 pounds 215kg of lunar material to bring back to earth command module pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the moons surface armstrong and aldrin spent 215 hours on the lunar surface before rejoining columbia in lunar orbit apollo 11 was launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island florida on july 16 at 1332 utc and was the fifth crewed mission of nasas apollo program the apollo spacecraft had three parts a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to earth a service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a lunar module lm that had two stages a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit after being sent to the moon by the saturn vs third stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquillity the astronauts used eagles ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to earth they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july 24 after more than eight days in space armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to a worldwide audience he described the event as one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind apollo 11 effectively ended the space race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by president john f kennedy before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth background in the late 1950s and early 1960s the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october 4 1957 the soviet union launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances and challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president dwight d eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and initiating project mercury which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit but on april 12 1961 soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the earth it was another body blow to american pride nearly a month later on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american in space completing a 15-minute suborbital journey after being recovered from the atlantic ocean he received a congratulatory telephone call from eisenhowers successor john f kennedy kennedy believed that it was in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations and that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable that the soviet union was more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning since the soviet union had better booster rockets he required a challenge that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality something spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such a project on may 25 1961 he addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and declared i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish we propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft we propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters much larger than any now being developed until certain which is superior we propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations-explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight but in a very real sense it will not be one man going to the moon-if we make this judgment affirmatively it will be an entire nation for all of us must work to put him there the effort to land a man on the moon already had a name project apollo an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous a space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up on july 11 1962 james webb announced the decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous this resulted in a much smaller launch vehicle and in the apollo spacecraft being composed of three major parts a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to earth a service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a lunar module lm that had two stages a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit this choice of mode meant that the spacecraft could be launched by a single saturn v rocket that was then under development technologies and technics required for apollo were developed by project gemini project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo 1 fire on january 27 1967 in which three astronauts died and the subsequent investigation in october 1968 apollo 7 evaluated the command module in earth orbit and in december apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit in march 1969 apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in earth orbit and in may apollo 10 conducted a dress rehearsal in lunar orbit by july 1969 all was in readiness for apollo 11 to take the final step onto the moon the soviet union competed with the us in the space race but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the n1 launcher which was comparable to the saturn v the soviets tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of unmanned probes on july 13 three days before apollo 11s launch the soviet union launched luna 15 which reached lunar orbit before apollo 11 during descent a malfunction caused luna 15 to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the moons surface to begin their voyage home the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories radio telescope in england recorded transmissions from luna 15 during its descent and these were released in july 2009 for the 40th anniversary of apollo 11 personnel prime crew the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong command module pilot cmp jim lovell and lunar module pilot lmp buzz aldrin on the backup crew for apollo 9 was officially announced on november 20 1967 lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini 12 due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm apollo 8 and apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews and armstrongs crew became the backup for apollo 8 based on the normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was then expected to command apollo 11 there would be one change michael collins the cmp on the apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae requiring surgery lovell took his place on the apollo 8 crew and when collins recovered he joined armstrongs crew as cmp in the meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo 8 apollo 11 was the second american mission where all the crewmembers had prior spaceflight experience the first being apollo 10 the next was sts-26 in 1988 slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission eventually apollo 13 the apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie that characterized that of apollo 12 instead they forged an amiable working relationship armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof but collins who considered himself a loner confessed to rebuffing aldrins attempts to create a more personal relationship aldrin and collins described the crew as amiable strangers armstrong did not agree with the assessment and said all the crews i was on worked very well together backup crew the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander william anders as cmp and haise as lmp anders had flown with lovell on apollo 8 in early 1969 he accepted a job with the national aeronautics and space council effective august 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut at that time ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo 11 was delayed past its intended july launch date at which point anders would be unavailable lovell haise and mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of apollo 13 support crew during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes they developed procedures especially those for emergency situations so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them for apollo 11 the support crew consisted of ken mattingly ronald evans and bill pogue capsule communicators the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo 11 the capcoms were charles duke ronald evans bruce mccandless ii james lovell william anders ken mattingly fred haise don l lind owen k garriott and harrison schmitt flight directors the four shift flight directors for this mission were clifford e charlesworth green team launch and extravehicular activity eva gerald d griffin gold team gene kranz white team lunar landing glynn lunney black team lunar ascent preparations insignia the apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by collins who wanted a symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states at lovells suggestion he chose the bald eagle the national bird of the united states as the symbol tom wilson a simulator instructor suggested that they put an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission collins added a lunar background with the earth in the distance the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left aldrin armstrong and collins decided that the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colours and decided on a blue and gold border armstrong was concerned that eleven would not be understood by non-english speakers so they went with apollo 11 and they decided not to put their names on the patch so it would be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing an illustrator at the msc did the artwork which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval the design was rejected bob gilruth the director of the msc felt that the talons of the eagle looked too warlike after some discussion the olive branch was moved to the talons when the eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971 the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side the design was also used for the smaller susan b anthony dollar unveiled in 1979 call signs after the crew of apollo 10 named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george m low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the manned spacecraft center msc to suggest the apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning the lm was named eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia at scheers suggestion the cm was named columbia after columbiad the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft also from florida in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon it also referenced columbia a historical name of the united states in collins 1976 book he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus mementos the astronaut had personal preference kits ppks small bags containing personal items of significance that they wanted to take with them on the mission five 05-pound 023kg ppks were carried on apollo 11 three one for each astronaut were stowed on columbia before launch and two on eagle neil armstrongs lm ppk contained a piece of wood from the wright brothers 1903 wright flyers left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to deke slayton by the widows of the apollo 1 crew this pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to slayton afterwards but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals the widows gave the pin to slayton armstrong took it with him on apollo 11 site selection nasas apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february 8 1968 these were the result of two years worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five unmanned probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program the best earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution project apollo required the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar scientific value was not a consideration areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed as no such site was found five sites were considered sites 1 and 2 were in the sea of tranquility mare tranquilitatis site 3 was in the central bay sinus medii and sites 4 and 5 were in the ocean of storms oceanus procellarum the final site selection was based on seven criteria the site needed to be smooth with relatively few craters with approach paths free of large hills tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings reachable with a minimum amount of propellant allowing for delays in the launch countdown providing the apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory one that would allow it to coast around the moon and safely return to earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the moon with good visibility during the landing approach meaning that the sun would be between 7 and 20 degrees behind the lm and a general slope of less than 2 degrees in the landing area the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive limiting the launch date to one day per month a landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience the apollo site selection board selected site 2 with sites 3 and 5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed in may 1969 apollo 10s lunar module flew to within 15 kilometers 93mi of site 2 and reported that it was acceptable first step decision during the first press conference after the apollo 11 crew was announced the first question a reporter asked was which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface slayton told the reporter that it had not been decided and armstrong added that it was not based on individual desire one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the command module pilot which matched what had been done in previous missions the commander had never performed the spacewalk reporters wrote in early 1969 that aldrin would be the first to walk on the moon and associate administrator george mueller told reporters he would be the first as well aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first to step on the moon because armstrong was a civilian which made aldrin livid aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander the decision was announced in a press conference on april 14 1969 for decades aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar modules hatch location because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult the crew tried a simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring slayton told armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first if he agreed armstrong said yes thats the way to do it the media accused armstrong of exercising his commanders prerogative to exit the spacecraft first chris kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between gilruth slayton low and himself to make sure aldrin would not be the first to walk on the moon they argued that the first person to walk on the moon should be like charles lindbergh a calm and quiet person they made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft pre-launch the ascent stage of lunar module lm-5 arrived at the kennedy space center on january 8 1969 followed by the descent stage four days later and command and service module cm-107 on january 23 there were several differences between lm-5 and apollo 10s lm-4 lm-5 had a vhf radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their eva on the lunar surface a lighter ascent engine more thermal protection on the landing gear and a package of scientific experiments known as the early apollo scientific experiments package easep the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch the command and service modules were mated on january 29 and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april 14 the s-ivb third stage of saturn v as-506 had arrived on january 18 followed by the s-ii second stage on february 6 s-ic first stage on february 20 and the saturn v instrument unit on february 27 at 1230 on may 20 the 5443-tonne 5357-long-ton 6000-short-ton assembly departed the vehicle assembly building atop the crawler-transporter bound for launch pad 39a part of launch complex 39 while apollo 10 was still on its way to the moon a countdown test commenced on june 26 and concluded on july 2 the launch complex was floodlit on the night of july 15 when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area in the early hours of the morning the fuel tanks of the s-ii and s-ivb stages were filled with liquid hydrogen fueling was completed by three hours before launch launch operations were partly automated with 43 programs written in the atoll programming language slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400 and they showered shaved and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen at 0630 they headed out to launch complex 39 haise entered columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time along with a technician he helped armstrong into the left hand couch at 0654 five minutes later collins joined him taking up his position on the right hand couch finally aldrin entered taking the center couch haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch the closeout crew sealed the hatch and the cabin was purged and pressurized the closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time the countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room mission launch and flight to lunar orbit an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army general william westmoreland four cabinet members 19 state governors 40 mayors 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen vice president spiro agnew viewed the launch with the former president lyndon b johnson and his wife lady bird johnson around 3500 media representatives were present about two-thirds were from the united states the rest came from 55 other countries the launch was televised live in 33 countries with an estimated 25 million viewers in the united states alone millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts president richard nixon viewed the launch from his office in the white house with his nasa liaison officer apollo astronaut frank borman saturn v as-506 launched apollo 11 on july 16 1969 at 133200 utc 93200 edt it entered earth orbit at an altitude of 1004 nautical miles 1859km by 989 nautical miles 1832km twelve minutes later after one and a half orbits the s-ivb third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the trans-lunar injection tli burn at 162213 utc about 30 minutes later with collins in the left seat and at the controls the transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating columbia from the spent s-ivb stage turning around and docking with eagle still attached to the stage after the lm was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon this was done to avoid colliding with the spacecraft the earth or the moon a slingshot effect from passing around the moon threw it into an orbit around the sun on july 19 at 172150 utc apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquillity about 12 miles 19km southwest of the crater sabine d the site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger 8 and surveyor 5 landers and the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or eva challenges it lay about 25 kilometers 16mi southeast of the surveyor 5 landing site and 68 kilometers 42mi southwest of ranger 8s crash site lunar descent at 125200 utc on july 20 aldrin and armstrong entered eagle and began the final preparations for lunar descent at 174400 eagle separated from columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployed armstrong exclaimed the eagle has wings as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early and reported that they were long they would land miles west of their target point eagle was traveling too fast the problem could have been masconsconcentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel or it could have been the result of eagles pirouette maneuver five minutes into the descent burn and 6000 feet 1800m above the surface of the moon the lm guidance computer lgc distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms inside mission control center computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them margaret hamilton the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled to blame the computer for the apollo 11 problems is like blaming the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department actually the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions a complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software the softwares action in this case was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones the computer rather than almost forcing an abort prevented an abort if the computer hadnt recognized this problem and taken recovery action i doubt if apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was during the mission the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time software engineer don eyles concluded in a 2005 guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first unmanned lm in apollo 5 having the rendezvous radar on so that it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort should have been irrelevant to the computer but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up the extra spurious cycle stealing as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter caused the computer alarms landing when armstrong again looked outside he saw that the computers landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-foot 91m diameter crater later determined to be west crater so he took semi-automatic control armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it but could not since their horizontal velocity was too fast throughout the descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting eagle now 107 feet 33m above the surface armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it as he got closer now 250 feet 76m above the surface he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it he cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground they were now 100 feet 30m from the surface with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining lunar dust kicked up by the lms engines began to obfuscate his ability to determine the spacecrafts motion some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecrafts speed a few moments before the landing a light informed aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch 170cm probes hanging from eagles footpads had touched the surface and he said contact light armstrong was supposed to immediately shutdown the engines as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make them explode but forgot three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong shutdown the engines aldrin immediately said okay engine stop aca out of detent armstrong acknowledged out of detent auto aldrin continued mode control both auto descent engine command override off engine arm off 413 is in aca was the attitude control assembly the lms control stick output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system rcs jets to fire out of detent meant that the stick had moved away from its centered position it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car lgc address 413 contained the variable that indicated that the lm had landed eagle landed at 201740 utc on sunday july 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left apollo 11 landed with less fuel than subsequent missions and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning this was later found to be the result of greater propellant slosh than expected uncovering a fuel sensor on subsequent missions extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this armstrong acknowledged aldrins completion of the post landing checklist with engine arm is off before responding to the capcom charles duke with the words houston tranquility base here the eagle has landed armstrongs unrehearsed change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control roger twan tranquility we copy you on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue were breathing again thanks a lot two and a half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin radioed to earth this is the lm pilot id like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in whoever and wherever they may be to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way he then took communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair who had objected to the apollo 8 crew reading from the book of genesis demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space as such aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church dean woodruff webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july 20 the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period but they chose to begin the preparations for the eva early thinking that they would be unable to sleep lunar surface operations preparations for the eva began at 2343 these took longer than expected three and a half hours instead of two during training on earth everything required had been neatly laid out in advance but on the moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well such as checklists food packets and tools once armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside eagle was depressurized the hatch was opened at 023933 armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system plss some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress at 0251 armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface the remote control unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet climbing down the nine-rung ladder armstrong pulled a d-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagles side and activate the tv camera apollo 11 used slow-scan television tv incompatible with broadcast tv so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor significantly reducing the quality of the picture the signal was received at goldstone in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station near canberra in australia minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on earth copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at nasa while still on the ladder armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the lm descent stage bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon the inscription read here men from the planet earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 ad we came in peace for all mankind after describing the surface dust as very fine-grained and almost like a powder at 025615 six and a half hours after landing armstrong stepped off eagles footpad and declared thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind armstrong intended to say thats one small step for a man but the word a is not audible in the transmission and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast when later asked about his quote armstrong said he believed he said for a man and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the a in square brackets one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for a together another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth partly because of storms near parkes observatory more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the a may have been spoken but obscured by static about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm twelve minutes after the sample was collected he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep then mounted it on a tripod the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva still photography was accomplished with a hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on armstrongs apolloskylab a7l space suit aldrin joined armstrong on the surface he described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity one-sixth of earths was even perhaps easier than the simulations its absolutely no trouble to walk around aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including two-footed kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backward but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagles shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit but the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing a flag of the united states on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera aldrin remembered of all the jobs i had to do on the moon the one i wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising but the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches 5cm into the hard lunar surface aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers but he gave a crisp west point salute before aldrin could take a photo of armstrong with the flag president richard nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo 11 convinced nixon to keep his words brief nixon hello neil and buzz im talking to you by telephone from the oval room at the white house and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made i just cant tell you how proud we all are of what youve done for every american this has to be the proudest day of our lives and for people all over the world i am sure they too join with americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of mans world and as you talk to us from the sea of tranquillity it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquillity to earth for one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people on this earth are truly one one in their pride in what you have done and one in our prayers that you will return safely to earth armstrong thank you mr president its a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the united states but men of peace of all nations and with interest and curiosity and men with a vision for the future its an honor for us to be able to participate here today they deployed the easep which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment then armstrong walked 196 feet 60m from the lm to snap photos at the rim of little west crater while aldrin collected two core samples he used the geologists hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo 11 but was unable to penetrate more than 6 inches 15cm deep the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes aldrin shoveled 6 kilograms 13lb of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly two types of rocks were found in the geological samples basalt and breccia three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins all have subsequently been found on earth mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension in a 2010 interview armstrong explained that nasa limited the first moonwalks time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon lunar ascent aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 2155 kilograms 475lb of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor lec this proved to be an inefficient tool and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the lm by hand armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped onto the ladders third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment the hatch was closed again at 0501 they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep nixons speech writer william safire had prepared in event of moon disaster for the president to read on television in the event the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon the contingency plan originated in a memo from safire to nixons white house chief of staff h r haldeman in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster according to the plan mission control would close down communications with the lm and a clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes first world war poem the soldier while moving inside the cabin aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon there was a concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch had this not worked the lm circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine after more than 212 hours on the lunar surface in addition to the scientific instruments the astronauts left behind an apollo 1 mission patch and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk the disk carries the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world the disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasas past and present top management after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight two and a half hours later at 175400 utc they lifted off in eagles ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some 25 feet 8m from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple the ascent stage of the lm separated i was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over subsequent apollo missions usually planted the american flags further from the lm to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust columbia in lunar orbit during his day flying solo around the moon collins never felt lonely although it has been said not since adam has any human known such solitude collins felt very much a part of the mission in his autobiography he wrote this venture has been structured for three men and i consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two in the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness but rather awareness anticipation satisfaction confidence almost exultation one of collins first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground to give collins an idea where to look mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site he tried in vain to find the module on his first orbits on the back side of the moon collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for armstrong and aldrin to return just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit mission control informed collins that there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant if it became too cold parts of columbia might freeze mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure 17 instead collins flicked the switch on the offending system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again and carried on with normal housekeeping chores while keeping an eye on the temperature when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again he was able to report that the problem had been resolved for the next couple of orbits he described his time on the back side of the moon as relaxing after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia collins was prepared for certain contingencies in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle return eagle rendezvoused with columbia at 2124 utc on july 21 and the two docked at 2135 eagles ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 2341 just before the apollo 12 flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon later nasa reports mentioned that eagles orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface on july 23 the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented the saturn v rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery every piece of which worked flawlessly we have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly all this is possible only through the blood sweat and tears of a number of people all you see is the three of us but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others and to all of those i would like to say thank you very much aldrin added this has been far more than three men on a mission to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown personally in reflecting on the events of the past several days a verse from psalms comes to mind when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him armstrong concluded the responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort next with the american people who have through their will indicated their desire next with four administrations and their congresses for implementing that will and then with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft the saturn the columbia the eagle and the little emu the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface we would like to give special thanks to all those americans who built the spacecraft who did the construction design the tests and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft to those people tonight we give a special thank you and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight god bless you good night from apollo 11 on the return to earth a bearing at the guam tracking station failed potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his ten-year-old son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease greg was later thanked by armstrong splashdown and quarantine the aircraft carrier usshornet under the command of captain carl j seiberlich was selected as the primary recovery ship prs for apollo 11 on june 5 replacing its sister ship the lph ussprinceton which had recovered apollo 10 on may 26 hornet was then at her home port of long beach california on reaching pearl harbor on july 5 hornet embarked the sikorsky sh-3 sea king helicopters of hs-4 a unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft specialized divers of udt detachment apollo a 35-man nasa recovery team and about 120 media representatives to make room most of hornets air wing was left behind in long beach special recovery equipment was also loaded including a boilerplate command module used for training on july 12 with apollo 11 still on the launch pad hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific in the vicinity of 1036n 17224e 10600n 172400e 10600 172400 a presidential party consisting of nixon borman secretary of state william p rogers and national security advisor henry kissinger flew to johnston atoll on air force one then to the command ship ussarlington in marine one after a night on board they would fly to hornet in marine one for a few hours of ceremonies on arrival aboard hornet the party was greeted by the commander-in-chief pacific command cincpac admiral john s mccain jr and nasa administrator thomas o paine who flew to hornet from pago pago in one of hornets carrier onboard delivery aircraft weather satellites were not yet common but us air force captain hank brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images he realized that a storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area poor visibility was a serious threat to the mission if the helicopters could not locate columbia the spacecraft its crew and its priceless cargo of moon rocks might be lost brandli alerted navy captain willard s houston jr the commander of the fleet weather center at pearl harbor who had the required security clearance on their recommendation rear admiral donald c davis the commander of manned spaceflight recovery forces pacific advised nasa to change the recovery area this was done a new one was designated 215 nautical miles 398km northeast of the original this altered the flight plan a different sequence of computer programs was used one never before attempted in a conventional entry p64 was followed by p67 for a skip-out re-entry p65 and p66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip in this case because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out p66 was not invoked and instead p65 led directly to p67 the crew were also warned that they would not be in a full-lift heads-down attitude when they entered p67 the first programs acceleration subjected the astronauts to 65 standard gravities 64ms the second to 60 standard gravities 59ms before dawn on july 24 hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman e-1 tracers two of the e-1s were designated as air boss while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment the third carried photographic equipment and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon at 1644 utc 0544 local time columbias drogue parachutes were deployed this was observed by the helicopters seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully 2660km 1440nmi east of wake island 380km 210nmi south of johnston atoll and 24km 13nmi from hornet at 1319n 1699w 13317n 169150w 13317 -169150 during splashdown columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction the divers then passed biological isolation garments bigs to the astronauts and assisted them into the life raft the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote but nasa took precautions at the recovery site the astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk after touchdown on hornet at 1753 utc the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay where the astronauts walked the 30 feet 91m to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin the earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo 12 and apollo 14 before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth he told them as a result of what youve done the world has never been closer together before after nixon departed hornet was brought alongside the 5-short-ton 45t columbia which was lifted aboard by the ships crane placed on a dolly and moved next to the mqf it was then attached to the mqf with a flexible tunnel allowing the lunar samples film data tapes and other items to be removed hornet returned to pearl harbor where the mqf was loaded onto a lockheed c-141 starlifter and airlifted to the manned spacecraft center the astronauts arrived at the lunar receiving laboratory at 1000 utc on july 28 columbia was taken to ford island for deactivation and its pyrotechnics made safe it was then taken to hickham air force base from whence it was flown to houston in a douglas c-133 cargomaster reaching the lunar receiving laboratory on july 30 in accordance with the extra-terrestrial exposure law a set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july 16 to codify its quarantine protocol the astronauts continued in quarantine after three weeks in confinement first in the apollo spacecraft then in their trailer on hornet and finally in the lunar receiving laboratory the astronauts were given a clean bill of health on august 10 1969 the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts on those who had joined them in quarantine nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki and on columbia itself loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study celebrations on august 13 the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago with an estimated six million attendees on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress 44 governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on september 16 1969 they presented two us flags one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate that had been carried to the surface of the moon with them the flag of american samoa on apollo 11 is on display at the jean p haydon museum in pago pago the capital of american samoa this celebration was the beginning of a 38-day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries the crew toured from september 29 to november 5 many nations honored the first human moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins legacy cultural significance humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedys goal set eight years earlier in mission control during the apollo 11 landing kennedys speech flashed on the screen followed by the words task accomplished july 1969 the success of apollo 11 demonstrated the united states technological superiority over other nations with the success of apollo 11 america had won the space race new phrases permeated into the english language if they can send a man to the moon why cant they became a common saying following apollo 11 armstrongs famous words on the lunar surface also spun off countless parodies while most celebrated the accomplishment disenfranchised americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in america evidenced by protesters outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo 11 launched this is not to say that they were not awed by it ralph abernathy leading a protest march was so captivated by the spectacle of the apollo 11 launch that he forgot what he was going to say racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on earth a poem by gil scott-heron called whitey on the moon illustrated the racial inequality in the united states that was highlighted by the space race the poem starts with a rat done bit my sister nell with whitey on the moon her face and arms began to swell and whiteys on the moon i cant pay no doctor bill but whiteys on the moon ten years from now ill be paying still while whiteys on the moon twenty percent of the worlds population watched humans walk on the moon for the first time while apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world the follow-on apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation one possible explanation was the shift in complexity landing someone on the moon was an easy goal to understand lunar geology was too abstract for the average person another is that kennedys goal of landing humans on the moon had already been accomplished a well-defined objective helped project apollo accomplish its goal but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions while most americans were proud of their nations achievements in space exploration only once during the late 1960s did the gallup poll indicate that a majority of americans favored doing more in space as opposed to doing less by 1973 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration the space race had ended and cold war tensions were easing as the us and soviet union entered the era of dtente this was also a time when inflation was rising which put pressure on the government to reduce spending what saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great drastic cuts warned caspar weinberger the deputy director of the office of management and budget might send a signal that our best years are behind us after the apollo 11 mission officials from the soviet union said that landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically the soviets publicly denied there was a race to the moon and indicated that they were not making an attempt mstislav keldysh said in july 1969 that we are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems it was revealed in 1989 that the soviets had tried to send people to the moon but were unable to due to technological difficulties the publics reaction in the soviet union was mixed the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction a portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it spacecraft the command module columbia went on a tour of the united states visiting 49 state capitals the district of columbia and anchorage alaska in 1971 it was transferred to the smithsonian institution and was displayed at the national air and space museum nasm in washington dc it was in the central milestones of flight exhibition hall in front of the jefferson drive entrance sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the wright flyer spirit of st louis bell x-1 north american x-15 and friendship 7 columbia was moved in 2017 to the nasm mary baker engen restoration hangar at the steven f udvar-hazy center in chantilly virginia to be readied for a four-city tour titled destination moon the apollo 11 mission this included space center houston from october 14 2017 to march 18 2018 the saint louis science center from april 14 to september 3 2018 the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh from september 29 2018 to february 18 2019 and the seattle museum of flight from march 16 to september 2 2019 for 40 years armstrongs and aldrins space suits were displayed in the museums apollo to the moon exhibit until it closed for good on december 3 2018 to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022 a special display of armstrongs suit is planned for the 50th anniversary of apollo 11 in july 2019 the quarantine trailer the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the smithsonians steven f udvar-hazy center annex near washington dulles international airport in chantilly virginia where they are on display along with a test lunar module the descent stage of the lm eagle remains on the moon in 2009 the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules scientific instruments and foot trails made by the astronauts the remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface after being abandoned and impacting the moon the location is uncertain because eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time in march 2012 a team of specialists financed by amazon founder jeff bezos located the f-1 engines from the s-ic stage that launched apollo 11 into space they were found on the atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning his team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface in july 2013 a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the atlantic which nasa confirmed was from apollo 11 the s-ivb third stage which performed apollo 11s trans-lunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of earth moon rocks the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas for safekeeping there is also a smaller collection stored at white sands test facility near las cruces new mexico most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture they are handled only indirectly using special tools over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year in november 1969 nixon asked nasa to make up about 250 presentation apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations the fifty states of the united states and its possessions and the united nations each display included moon dust from apollo 11 the rice-sized particles were four small pieces of moon soil weighing about 50mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a united states half dollar coin this acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust the apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by nixon in 1970 the passive seismic experiment ran until the command uplink failed on august 25 1969 the downlink failed on december 14 1969 as of 2018 the lunar laser ranging experiment remains operational 40th anniversary events on july 15 2009 lifecom released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by life photographer ralph morse prior to the apollo 11 launch from july 16 to 24 2009 nasa streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments in july 2010 air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in mission control during the apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time the john f kennedy presidential library and museum set up an adobe flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of apollo 11 from launch to landing on the moon on july 20 2009 armstrong aldrin and collins met with us president barack obama at the white house we expect that there is as we speak another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next armstrong collins and aldrin obama said we want to make sure that nasa is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey on august 7 2009 an act of congress awarded the three astronauts a congressional gold medal the highest civilian award in the united states the bill was sponsored by florida senator bill nelson and florida representative alan grayson a group of british scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the moon landing it was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today the apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date nothing since apollo has come close to the excitement that was generated by those astronauts armstrong aldrin and the 10 others who followed them 50th anniversary events on june 10 2015 united states congressman bill posey introduced resolution hr 2726 to the 114th session of the united states house of representatives directing the united states
