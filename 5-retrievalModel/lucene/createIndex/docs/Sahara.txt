the sahara uk shr shr arabic a-ar al-kubr the great desert is a desert located on the african continent it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third largest desert overall after antarctica and the arctic its area of 9200000 square kilometres 3600000sqmi is comparable to the area of china or the united states the name sahara is derived from a dialectal arabic word for desert ara sara the desert comprises much of north africa excluding the fertile region on the mediterranean sea coast the atlas mountains of the maghreb and the nile valley in egypt and sudan it stretches from the red sea in the east and the mediterranean in the north to the atlantic ocean in the west where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains to the south it is bounded by the sahel a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the niger river valley and the sudan region of sub-saharan africa the sahara can be divided into several regions including the western sahara the central ahaggar mountains the tibesti mountains the ar mountains the tnr desert and the libyan desert for several hundred thousand years the sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 41000 year cycle caused by the precession of the earths axis as it rotates around the sun which changes the location of the north african monsoon the area is next expected to become green in about 15000 years 17000 ad there is a suggestion that the last time that the sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to overgrazing by the cattle of the local population geography the sahara covers large parts of algeria chad egypt libya mali mauritania niger western sahara sudan and tunisia it covers 9million square kilometres 3500000sqmi amounting to 31 of africa if all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than 250mm were included the sahara would be 11million square kilometres 4200000sqmi it is one of three distinct physiographic provinces of the african massive physiographic division the sahara is mainly rocky hamada stone plateaus ergs sand seas large areas covered with sand dunes form only a minor part but many of the sand dunes are over 180 metres 590ft high wind or rare rainfall shape the desert features sand dunes dune fields sand seas stone plateaus gravel plains reg dry valleys wadi dry lakes oued and salt flats shatt or chott unusual landforms include the richat structure in mauritania several deeply dissected mountains many volcanic rise from the desert including the ar mountains ahaggar mountains saharan atlas tibesti mountains adrar des iforas and the red sea hills the highest peak in the sahara is emi koussi a shield volcano in the tibesti range of northern chad the central sahara is hyperarid with sparse vegetation the northern and southern reaches of the desert along with the highlands have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub with trees and taller shrubs in wadis where moisture collects in the central hyperarid region there are many subdivisions of the great desert tanezrouft the tnr the libyan desert the eastern desert the nubian desert and others these extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years to the north the sahara skirts the mediterranean sea in egypt and portions of libya but in cyrenaica and the maghreb the sahara borders the mediterranean forest woodland and scrub eco-regions of northern africa all of which have a mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters according to the botanical criteria of frank white and geographer robert capot-rey the northern limit of the sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto a grass typical of the mediterranean climate portion of the maghreb and iberia the northern limit also corresponds to the 100mm 39in isohyet of annual precipitation to the south the sahara is bounded by the sahel a belt of dry tropical savanna with a summer rainy season that extends across africa from east to west the southern limit of the sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of cornulaca monacantha a drought-tolerant member of the chenopodiaceae or northern limit of cenchrus biflorus a grass typical of the sahel according to climatic criteria the southern limit of the sahara corresponds to the 150mm 59in isohyet of annual precipitation this is a long-term average since precipitation varies annually important cities located in the sahara include nouakchott the capital of mauritania tamanrasset ouargla bchar hassi messaoud ghardaa and el oued in algeria timbuktu in mali agadez in niger ghat in libya and faya-largeau in chad climate the sahara is the worlds largest low-latitude hot desert it is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from upper levels of the troposphere tends to sink towards the ground this steady descending airflow causes a warming and a drying effect in the upper troposphere the sinking air prevents evaporating water from rising and therefore prevents adiabatic cooling which makes cloud formation extremely difficult to nearly impossible the permanent dissolution of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation the stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning thus making rainfall virtually non-existent as a consequence the weather tends to be sunny dry and stable with a minimal chance of rainfall subsiding diverging dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers the subtropical ridge is the predominant factor that explains the hot desert climate kppen climate classification bwh of this vast region the descending airflow is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the great desert in the libyan desert this is the sunniest driest and the most nearly rainless place on the planet rivaling the atacama desert lying in chile and peru the rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the sahara rather than the western the prevailing air mass lying above the sahara is the continental tropical ct air mass which is hot and dry hot dry air masses primarily form over the north-african desert from the heating of the vast continental land area and it affects the whole desert during most of the year because of this extreme heating process a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime the sahara high represents the eastern continental extension of the azores high centered over the north atlantic ocean the subsidence of the sahara high nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods the effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent also to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself the desert is made even drier by its geographical configuration and location indeed the extreme aridity of the sahara is not only explained by the subtropical high pressure the atlas mountains of algeria morocco and tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert these major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding mediterranean climates the primary source of rain in the sahara is the intertropical convergence zone a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief short and irregular rainy season to the sahel and southern sahara rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation the harsh climate of the sahara is characterized by extremely low unreliable highly erratic rainfall extremely high sunshine duration values high temperatures year-round negligible rates of relative humidity a significant diurnal temperature variation and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide temperature the sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the sahara most of the desert has more than 3600 hours of bright sunshine per year over 82 of daylight hours and a wide area in the eastern part has over 4000 hours of bright sunshine per year over 91 of daylight hours the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value a value of 4300 hours 98 of the time would be recorded in upper egypt aswan luxor and in the nubian desert wadi halfa the annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2800 kwhm year in the great desert the sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production the high position of the sun the extremely low relative humidity and the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the great desert the hottest large region in the world and the hottest place on earth during summer in some spots the average high temperature exceeds 38 to 40c or 1004 to 1040f during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high altitudes the worlds highest officially recorded average daily high temperature was 47c or 1166f in a remote desert town in the algerian desert called bou bernous at an elevation of 378 metres 1240ft above sea level and only death valley california rivals it other hot spots in algeria such as adrar timimoun in salah ouallene aoulef reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 metres 660 and 1310ft above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46c or 1148f during the hottest months of the year salah well known in algeria for its extreme heat has average high temperatures of 438c or 1108f 464c or 1155f 455c or 1139f and 419c or 1074f in june july august and september respectively there are even hotter spots in the sahara but they are located in extremely remote areas especially in the azalai lying in northern mali the major part of the desert experiences around three to five months when the average high strictly exceeds 40c or 104f while in the southern central part of the desert there are up to six or seven months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40c or 104f some examples of this are bilma niger and faya-largeau chad the annual average daily temperature exceeds 20c or 68f everywhere and can approach 30c or 86f in the hottest regions year-round however most of the desert has a value in excess of 25c or 77f sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme during daytime the sand temperature is extremely high it can easily reach 80c or 176f or more a sand temperature of 835c 1823f has been recorded in port sudan ground temperatures of 72c or 1616f have been recorded in the adrar of mauritania and a value of 75c 167f has been measured in borkou northern chad due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity the desert usually has high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights however it is a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the sahara the average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 and 20c or 234 and 360f the lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10c or 18f while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest mainly in the southern sahara still it is true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below especially in high-elevation areas the frequency of subfreezing winter nights in the sahara is strongly influenced by the north atlantic oscillation nao with warmer winter temperatures during negative nao events and cooler winters with more frosts when the nao is positive this is because the weaker clockwise flow around the eastern side of the subtropical anticyclone during negative nao winters although too dry to produce more than negligible precipitation does reduce the flow of dry cold air from higher latitudes of eurasia into the sahara significantly precipitation the average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part the thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea along the polar front although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres 4in to 250 millimetres 10in for example biskra algeria and ouarzazate morocco are found in this zone the southern fringe of the desert along the border with the sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the intertropical convergence zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres 4in to 250 millimetres 10in for example timbuktu mali and agadez niger are found in this zone the vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 millimetre 004in in fact most of the sahara receives less than 20 millimetres 08in of the 9000000 square kilometres 3500000sqmi of desert land in the sahara an area of about 2800000 square kilometres 1100000sqmi about 31 of the total area receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 millimetres 04in or less while some 1500000 square kilometres 580000sqmi about 17 of the total area receives an average of 5 millimetres 02in or less the annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1000000 square kilometres 390000sqmi in the eastern sahara comprising deserts of libya egypt and sudan tazirbu kufra dakhla kharga farafra siwa asyut sohag luxor aswan abu simbel wadi halfa where the long-term mean approximates 05 millimetres 002in per year rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the sahara as it may vary considerably year by year in full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high roughly ranging from 2500 millimetres 100in per year to more than 6000 millimetres 240in per year in the whole desert nowhere else on earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the sahara region however at least two instances of snowfall have been recorded in sahara in february 1979 and december 2016 both in the town of ain sefra desertification and prehistoric climate the climate of the sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years believed to be caused by long-term changes in the north african climate cycle that alters the path of the north african monsoon usually southward the cycle is caused by a 41000-year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22 and 245 at present 2000 ad we are in a dry period but it is expected that the sahara will become green again in 15000 years 17000 ad when the north african monsoon is at its strongest annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the sahara region increase resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the green sahara for a relatively weak north african monsoon the opposite is true with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the sahara climate cycle known as the desert sahara the idea that changes in insolation solar heating caused by long-term changes in the earths orbit are a controlling factor for the long-term variations in the strength of monsoon patterns across the globe was first suggested by rudolf spitaler in the late nineteenth century the hypothesis was later formally proposed and tested by the meteorologist john kutzbach in 1981 kutzbachs ideas about the impacts of insolation on global monsoonal patterns have become widely accepted today as the underlying driver of long term monsoonal cycles kutzbach never formally named his hypothesis and as such it is referred to here as the orbital monsoon hypothesis as suggested by ruddiman in 2001 during the last glacial period the sahara was much larger than it is today extending south beyond its current boundaries the end of the glacial period brought more rain to the sahara from about 8000 bce to 6000 bce perhaps because of low pressure areas over the collapsing ice sheets to the north once the ice sheets were gone the northern sahara dried out in the southern sahara the drying trend was initially counteracted by the monsoon which brought rain further north than it does today by around 4200 bce however the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today leading to the gradual desertification of the sahara the sahara is now as dry as it was about 13000 years ago the sahara pump theory describes this cycle during periods of a wet or green sahara the sahara becomes a savanna grassland and various flora and fauna become more common following inter-pluvial arid periods the sahara area then reverts to desert conditions and the flora and fauna are forced to retreat northwards to the atlas mountains southwards into west africa or eastwards into the nile valley this separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates forcing them to adapt possibly giving rise to allopatric speciation it is also proposed that humans accelerated the drying out period from 60002500 bce by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland evidence for cycles the growth of speleothems which requires rainwater was detected in hol-zakh ashalim even-sid maale-ha-meyshar ktora cracks nagev tzavoa cave and elsewhere and has allowing tracking of prehistoric rainfall the red sea coastal route was extremely arid before 140 and after 115 kya slightly wetter conditions appear at 9087 kya but it still was just one tenth the rainfall around 125 kya in the southern negev desert speleothems did not grow between 185140 kya mis 6 11090 mis 5452 nor after 85 kya nor during most of the interglacial period mis 51 the glacial period and holocene this suggests that the southern negev was arid to hyper-arid in these periods during the last glacial maximum lgm the sahara desert was more extensive than it is now with the extent of the tropical forests being greatly reduced and the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the hadley cell this is a climate cell which causes rising tropical air of the inter-tropical convergence zone itcz to bring rain to the tropics while dry descending air at about 20 degrees north flows back to the equator and brings desert conditions to this region it is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust and these dust levels are found as expected in marine cores from the north tropical atlantic but around 12500 bce the amount of dust in the cores in the bllingallerd phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the sahara indicating a dansgaard-oeschger do event a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate the moister saharan conditions had begun about 12500 bce with the extension of the itcz northward in the northern hemisphere summer bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the sahara which apart from a short dry spell associated with the younger dryas peaked during the holocene thermal maximum climatic phase at 4000 bce when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past analysis of nile river deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the blue nile suggesting higher rainfall also in the ethiopian highlands this was caused principally by a stronger monsoonal circulation throughout the sub-tropical regions affecting india arabia and the sahara lake victoria only recently became the source of the white nile and dried out almost completely around 15 kya the sudden subsequent movement of the itcz southwards with a heinrich event a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming linked to changes with the el nio-southern oscillation cycle led to a rapid drying out of the saharan and arabian regions which quickly became desert this is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the nile floods between 2700 and 2100 bce ecoregions the sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions with their variations in temperature rainfall elevation and soil these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals the atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool canary current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens succulents and shrubs it covers an area of 39900 square kilometers 15400sqmi in the south of morocco and mauritania the north saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert next to the mediterranean forests woodlands and scrub ecoregions of the northern maghreb and cyrenaica winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid sahara proper to the south it covers 1675300 square kilometers 646840sqmi in algeria egypt libya mauritania morocco and tunisia the sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic vegetation is rare and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes erg chech raoui stone plateaus hamadas gravel plains reg dry valleys wadis and salt flats it covers 4639900 square kilometres 1791500sqmi of algeria chad egypt libya mali mauritania niger and sudan the south saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid sahara and the sahel savannas to the south movements of the equatorial intertropical convergence zone itcz bring summer rains during july and august which average 100 to 200mm 4 to 8in but vary greatly from year to year these rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses this ecoregion covers 1101700 square kilometres 425400sqmi in algeria chad mali mauritania and sudan in the west saharan montane xeric woodlands several volcanic highlands provide a cooler moister environment that supports saharo-mediterranean woodlands and shrublands the ecoregion covers 258100 square kilometres 99650sqmi mostly in the tassili najjer of algeria with smaller enclaves in the ar of niger the dhar adrar of mauritania and the adrar des iforas of mali and algeria the tibesti-jebel uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion consists of the tibesti and jebel uweinat highlands higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of date palm acacias myrtle oleander tamarix and several rare and endemic plants the ecoregion covers 82200 square kilometres 31700sqmi in the tibesti of chad and libya and jebel uweinat on the border of egypt libya and sudan the saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic salt-adapted plant communities the saharan halophytics cover 54000 square kilometres 21000sqmi including the qattara and siwa depressions in northern egypt the tunisian salt lakes of central tunisia chott melghir in algeria and smaller areas of algeria mauritania and the southern part of morocco the tanezrouft is one of the harshest regions on earth as well as one of the hottest and driest parts of the sahara with no vegetation and very little life it is along the borders of algeria niger and mali west of the hoggar mountains flora and fauna the flora of the sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert floristically the sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received the northern mediterranean central and southern zones there are two transitional zones the mediterranean-sahara transition and the sahel transition zone the saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of vascular plants approximately a quarter of these are endemic about half of these species are common to the flora of the arabian deserts the central sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area plants such as acacia trees palms succulents spiny shrubs and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover several species of fox live in the sahara including the fennec fox pale fox and rppells fox the addax a large white antelope can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking the dorcas gazelle is a north african gazelle that can also go for a long time without water other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle the saharan cheetah northwest african cheetah lives in algeria togo niger mali benin and burkina faso there remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs which are very cautious fleeing any human presence the cheetah avoids the sun from april to october seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias they are unusually pale the other cheetah subspecies northeast african cheetah lives in chad sudan and the eastern region of niger however it is currently extinct in the wild in egypt and libya there are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild other animals include the monitor lizards hyrax sand vipers and small populations of african wild dog in perhaps only 14 countries and red-necked ostrich other animals exist in the sahara birds in particular such as african silverbill and black-faced firefinch among others there are also small desert crocodiles in mauritania and the ennedi plateau of chad the deathstalker scorpion can be 10cm 39in long its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous however a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult the saharan silver ant is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat and the threat of predators the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day dromedary camels and goats are the domesticated animals most commonly found in the sahara because of its qualities of endurance and speed the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water oases or where water comes close to the surface here the local pressure on natural resources can be intense the remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation in recent years development projects have started in the deserts of algeria and tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers these schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization researchers from hacettepe university ycekutlu n et al 2011 have reported that saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat history people lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago since the end of the last glacial period the sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today over 30000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles survive with half found in the tassili najjer in southeast algeria fossils of dinosaurs including afrovenator jobaria and ouranosaurus have also been found here the modern sahara though is not lush in vegetation except in the nile valley at a few oases and in the northern highlands where mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow it was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 bce after shifts in the earths axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation which led to the abrupt desertification of north africa about 5400 years ago however this theory has recently been called into dispute when samples taken from several seven-million-year-old sand deposits led scientists to reconsider the timeline for desertification kiffians the kiffian culture is a prehistoric industry or domain that existed between 10000 and 8000 years ago in the sahara during the neolithic subpluvial human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as gobero located in niger in the tnr desert the site is known as the largest and earliest grave of stone age people in the sahara desert the kiffians were skilled hunters bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the holocene wet phase a period when the sahara was verdant and wet the kiffian people were tall standing over six feet in height craniometric analysis indicates that this early holocene population was closely related to the late pleistocene iberomaurusians and early holocene capsians of the maghreb as well as mid-holocene mechta groups traces of the kiffian culture do not exist after 8000 years ago as the sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years after this time the tenerian culture colonized the area tenerians gobero was discovered in 2000 during an archaeological expedition led by paul sereno which sought dinosaur remains two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site the early holocene kiffian culture and the middle holocene tenerian culture the kiffians were a prehistoric people who preceded the tenerians and vanished approximately 8000 years ago when the desert became very dry the desiccation lasted until around 4600 bce when the earliest artefacts associated with the tenerians have been dated to some 200 skeletons have been discovered at gobero the tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier kiffians craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct the kiffian skulls are akin to those of the late pleistocene iberomaurusians early holocene capsians and mid-holocene mechta groups whereas the tenerian crania are more like those of mediterranean groups graves show that the tenerians observed spiritual traditions as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo tusks and clay pots the most interesting find is a triple burial dated to 5300 years ago of an adult female and two children estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old hugging each other pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers the three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma they did not die violently and they have been buried so elaborately unlikely if they had died of a plague the cause of their deaths is a mystery tashwinat mummy uan muhuggiag appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium bce to about 2700 bce although not necessarily continuously the most noteworthy find at uan muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately 2 12 years old the child was in a fetal position then embalmed then placed in a sack made of antelope skin which was insulated by a layer of leaves the boys organs were removed as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing an ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient egypt in 19581959 an archaeological expedition led by antonio ascenzi conducted anthropological radiological histological and chemical analyses on the uan muhuggiag mummy the specimen was determined to be that of a 30-month old child of uncertain sex who possessed negroid features a long incision on the specimens abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation one other individual an adult was found at uan muhuggiag buried in a crouched position however the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation the body was estimated to date from about 7500 bp nubians during the neolithic era before the onset of desertification around 9500 bce the central sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert like the wadi el-qaab by the 5th millennium bce the people who inhabited what is now called nubia were full participants in the agricultural revolution living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a cattle cult like those found in sudan and other pastoral societies in africa today megaliths found at nabta playa are overt examples of probably the worlds first known archaeoastronomy devices predating stonehenge by some 2000 years this complexity as observed at nabta playa and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there likely formed the basis for the structure of both the neolithic society at nabta and the old kingdom of egypt egyptians by 6000 bce predynastic egyptians in the southwestern corner of egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium bce centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture cattle goats pigs and sheep metal objects replaced prior ones of stone tanning of animal skins pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also there are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the al fayyum in the 6th millennium bce with food activities centering on fishing hunting and food-gathering stone arrowheads knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found burial items included pottery jewelry farming and hunting equipment and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit burial in desert environments appears to enhance egyptian preservation rites and the dead were buried facing due west by 3400 bce the sahara was as dry as it is today due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the earths orbit as a result of this aridification it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods the only major exception being the nile valley the nile however was impassable at several cataracts making trade and contact by boat difficult phoenicians the people of phoenicia who flourished from 1200800 bce created a confederation of kingdoms across the entire sahara to egypt they generally settled along the mediterranean coast as well as the sahara among the people of ancient libya who were the ancestors of people who speak berber languages in north africa and the sahara today including the tuareg of the central sahara the phoenician alphabet seems to have been adopted by the ancient libyans of north africa and tifinagh is still used today by berber-speaking tuareg camel herders of the central sahara sometime between 633 bce and 530 bce hanno the navigator either established or reinforced phoenician colonies in western sahara but all ancient remains have vanished with virtually no trace greeks by 500 bce greeks arrived in the desert greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert establishing trading colonies along the red sea the carthaginians explored the atlantic coast of the desert but the turbulence of the waters and the lack of markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern morocco centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east it remained outside the control of these states raids from the nomadic berber people of the desert were of constant concern to those living on the edge of the desert urban civilization an urban civilization the garamantes arose around 500 bce in the heart of the sahara in a valley that is now called the wadi al-ajal in fezzan libya the garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields the garamantes grew populous and strong conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves who were put to work extending the tunnels the ancient greeks and the romans knew of the garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads however they traded with them and a roman bath has been found in the garamantes capital of garama archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the garamantes territory the garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains berbers the berber people occupied and still occupy with arabs much of the sahara the garamantes berbers built a prosperous empire in the heart of the desert the tuareg nomads continue to inhabit and move across wide sahara surfaces to the present day islamic and arabic expansion the byzantine empire ruled the northern shores of the sahara from the

include present-day algeria chad mali then french sudan including timbuktu mauritania morocco 1912 niger and tunisia 1881 by the beginning of the 20th century the trans-saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means such as airplanes rather than across the desert the french colonial empire was the dominant presence in the sahara it

postworld war ii era several mines and communities have developed to utilize the deserts natural resources these include large deposits of oil and natural gas in algeria and libya and large deposits of phosphates in morocco and western sahara a number of trans-african highways have been proposed across the sahara including the cairodakar highway along the atlantic coast the trans-sahara highway from algiers on the mediterranean to kano in nigeria the tripoli cape town highway from tripoli in libya to ndjamena in chad and the cairo cape town highway which follows the nile each of these

unlike neighboring west africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the sahara the french language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with tuareg and berber leaders and culture the legacy of the french colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the third and fourth republics which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in arabic which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the french government who according to keenan documented a space of intercultural mediation contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region see also arid lands information
