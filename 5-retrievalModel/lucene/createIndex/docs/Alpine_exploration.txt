the higher region of the alps were long left to the exclusive attention of the inhabitants of the adjoining valleys even when alpine travellers as distinguished from alpine climbers began to visit these valleys it is reckoned that about 20 glacier passes were certainly known before 1600 about 25 more before 1700 and yet another 20 before 1800 but though the attempt of pa arnod an official of the duchy of aosta in 1689 to re-open the col du ceant may be counted as made by a non-native historical records do not show any further such activities until the last quarter of the 18th century nor did it fare much better with the high peaks though the two earliest recorded ascents were due to non-natives that of the rocciamelone in 1358 having been undertaken in fulfilment of a vow and that of the mont aiguille in 1492 by order of charles viii of france in order to destroy its immense reputation for inaccessibility in 1555 conrad gesner did not climb pilatus proper but only the grassy mound of the gnepfstein the lowest and the most westerly of the seven summits early 19th century the first men who really systematically explored the regions of ice and snow were horace-bndict de saussure 17401799 as regards the pennine alps and the benedictine monk of disentis placidus a spescha 17521833 most of whose ascents were made before 1806 in the valleys at the sources of the rhine in the early 19th century the meyer family of aarau conquered in person the jungfrau 1811 and by deputy the finsteraarhorn 1812 besides opening several glacier passes their energy being entirely confined to the bernese oberland their pioneer work was continued in that district as well as others by a number of swiss pre-eminent among whom were gottlieb samuel studer 18041890 of bern and edouard desor 18111882 of neuchtel the first-known english climber in the alps was colonel mark beaufoy 17641827 who in 1787 made an ascent the fourth of mont blanc a mountain to which his fellow-countrymen long exclusively devoted themselves with a few noteworthy exceptions such as principal jd forbes 18091868 a t malkin 18031888 john ball 18181889 and sir alfred wills 18281912 in the eastern alps the serious exploration began with the first ascent of the groglockner in 1800 initiated by franz-xaver salm-raifferscheid archbishop of gurk around monte rosa the vincent family josef zumstein 17831861 and giovanni gnifetti 18011867 did good work during the half century between 1778 and 1842 while in the eastern alps the archduke john 17821850 prince f j c von schwarzenberg archbishop of salzburg 18091885 valentine stanig 17741847 adolf schaubach 18001850 above all pj thurwieser 17891865 deserve to be recalled as pioneers in the first half of the 19th century late 19th century in the early fifties of the 19th century the taste for mountaineering rapidly developed for several very different reasons a great stimulus was given to it by the foundation of the various alpine clubs each of which drew together the climbers who dwelt in the same country the first was the english alpine club founded in the winter of 18571858 followed in 1862 by the austrian alpine club which in 1873 was fused under the name of the german and austrian alpine club with the german alpine club founded in 1869 in 1863 by the italian and swiss alpine clubs and in 1874 by the french alpine club not to mention numerous minor societies of more local character it was by the members of these clubs and a few others that the minute exploration now all but complete of the high alps was carried out while much has been done in the way of building club huts organizing and training guides c to smooth the way for later comers who would benefit by the detailed information published in the periodicals the
