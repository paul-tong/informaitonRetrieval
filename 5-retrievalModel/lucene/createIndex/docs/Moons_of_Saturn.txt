the moons of saturn are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous titan which is larger than the planet mercury saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own seven saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape yet only two of those titan and rhea are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium particularly notable among saturns moons are titan the second-largest moon in the solar system after jupiters ganymede with a nitrogen-rich earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system and enceladus since its chemical composition is similar to that of comets in particular enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate the presence of liquid water under its south pole region and may have a global ocean below its surface twenty-four of saturns moons are regular satellites they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to saturns equatorial plane they include the seven major satellites four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of saturns f ring two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in saturns rings the relatively large hyperion is locked in a resonance with titan the remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the a ring within g ring and between the major moons mimas and enceladus the regular satellites are traditionally named after titans and titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological saturn the remaining 38 with mean diameters ranging from 4 to 213 km are irregular satellites whose orbits are much farther from saturn have high inclinations and are mixed between prograde and retrograde these moons are probably captured minor planets or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured creating collisional families the irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the inuit norse and gallic groups and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the largest of the irregular moons is phoebe the ninth moon of saturn discovered at the end of the 19th century the rings of saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across each in its own orbit around saturn thus a precise number of saturnian moons cannot be given because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form saturns ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects discovery early observations before the advent of telescopic photography eight moons of saturn were discovered by direct observation using optical telescopes saturns largest moon titan was discovered in 1655 by christiaan huygens using a 57-millimeter 22in objective lens on a refracting telescope of his own design tethys dione rhea and iapetus the sidera lodoicea were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by giovanni domenico cassini mimas and enceladus were discovered in 1789 by william herschel hyperion was discovered in 1848 by wc bond gp bond and william lassell the use of long-exposure photographic plates made possible the discovery of additional moons the first to be discovered in this manner phoebe was found in 1899 by wh pickering in 1966 the tenth satellite of saturn was discovered by audouin dollfus when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox it was later named janus a few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present and that it had an orbit similar to that of janus this object is now known as epimetheus the eleventh moon of saturn it shares the same orbit with janusthe only known example of co-orbitals in the solar system in 1980 three additional saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the voyager probes they are trojan moons of dione helene and tethys telesto and calypso observations by spacecraft the study of the outer planets has since been revolutionized by the use of unmanned space probes the arrival of the voyager spacecraft at saturn in 19801981 resulted in the discovery of three additional moons atlas prometheus and pandora bringing the total to 17 in addition epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from janus in 1990 pan was discovered in archival voyager images the cassini mission which arrived at saturn in the summer of 2004 initially discovered three small inner moons including methone and pallene between mimas and enceladus as well as the second trojan moon of dione polydeuces it also observed three suspected but unconfirmed moons in the f ring in november 2004 cassini scientists announced that the structure of saturns rings indicates the presence of several more moons orbiting within the rings although only one daphnis had been visually confirmed at the time in 2007 anthe was announced in 2008 it was reported that cassini observations of a depletion of energetic electrons in saturns magnetosphere near rhea might be the signature of a tenuous ring system around saturns second largest moon in march 2009 aegaeon a moonlet within the g ring was announced in july of the same year s2009 s 1 the first moonlet within the b ring was observed in april 2014 the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring was reported related image outer moons study of saturns moons has also been aided by advances in telescope instrumentation primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates for the entire 20th century phoebe stood alone among saturns known moons with its highly irregular orbit beginning in 2000 however three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes a survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting saturn at a great distance in eccentric orbits which are highly inclined to both the equator of saturn and the ecliptic they are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by saturns gravitational pull in 2005 astronomers using the mauna kea observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons in 2006 astronomers using the subaru 82m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons in april 2007 tarqeq s2007 s 1 was announced and in may of the same year s2007 s 2 and s2007 s 3 were reported some of the 62 known satellites of saturn are considered lost because they have not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations work has been done to recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards but eight s2007 s 2 s2004 s 13 s2006 s 1 s2007 s 3 s2004 s 17 s2004 s 12 s2004 s 7 and s2006 s 3 still remain lost today naming the modern names for saturnian moons were suggested by john herschel in 1847 he proposed to name them after mythological figures associated with the roman titan of time saturn equated to the greek cronus in particular the then known seven satellites were named after titans titanesses and giantsbrothers and sisters of cronus in 1848 lassell proposed that the eighth satellite of saturn be named hyperion after another titan when in the 20th century the names of titans were exhausted the moons were named after different characters of the greco-roman mythology or giants from other mythologies all the irregular moons except phoebe are named after inuit and gallic gods and after norse ice giants some asteroids share the same names as moons of saturn 55 pandora 106 dione 577 rhea 1809 prometheus 1810 epimetheus and 4450 pan in addition two more asteroids previously shared the names of saturnian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the international astronomical union iau calypso and asteroid 53 kalypso and helene and asteroid 101 helena sizes saturns satellite system is very lopsided one moon titan comprises more than 96 of the mass in orbit around the planet the six other planemo ellipsoidal moons constitute roughly 4 of the mass and the remaining 55 small moons together with the rings comprise only 004 orbital groups although the boundaries may be somewhat vague saturns moons can be divided into ten groups according to their orbital characteristics many of them such as pan and daphnis orbit within saturns ring system and have orbital periods only slightly longer than the planets rotation period the innermost moons and most regular satellites all have mean orbital inclinations ranging from less than a degree to about 15 degrees except iapetus which has an inclination of 757 degrees and small orbital eccentricities on the other hand irregular satellites in the outermost regions of saturns moon system in particular the norse group have orbital radii of millions of kilometers and orbital periods lasting several years the moons of the norse group also orbit in the opposite direction to saturns rotation ring moonlets during late july 2009 a moonlet s2009 s 1 was discovered in the b ring 480km from the outer edge of the ring by the shadow it cast it is estimated to be 300m in diameter unlike the a ring moonlets see below it does not induce a propeller feature probably due to the density of the b ring in 2006 four tiny moonlets were found in cassini images of the a ring before this discovery only two larger moons had been known within gaps in the a ring pan and daphnis these are large enough to clear continuous gaps in the ring in contrast a moonlet is only massive enough to clear two smallabout 10km acrosspartial gaps in the immediate vicinity of the moonlet itself creating a structure shaped like an airplane propeller the moonlets themselves are tiny ranging from about 40 to 500meters in diameter and are too small to be seen directly in 2007 the discovery of 150 more moonlets revealed that they with the exception of two that have been seen outside the encke gap are confined to three narrow bands in the a ring between 126750 and 132000km from saturns center each band is about a thousand kilometers wide which is less than 1 the width of saturns rings this region is relatively free from the disturbances caused by resonances with larger satellites although other areas of the a ring without disturbances are apparently free of moonlets the moonlets were probably formed from the breakup of a larger satellite it is estimated that the a ring contains 70008000 propellers larger than 08km in size and millions larger than 025km similar moonlets may reside in the f ring there jets of material may be due to collisions initiated by perturbations from the nearby small moon prometheus of these moonlets with the core of the f ring one of the largest f ring moonlets may be the as-yet unconfirmed object s2004 s 6 the f ring also contains transient fans which are thought to result from even smaller moonlets about 1km in diameter orbiting near the f ring core one of the recently discovered moons aegaeon resides within the bright arc of g ring and is trapped in the 76 mean-motion resonance with mimas this means that it makes exactly seven revolutions around saturn while mimas makes exactly six the moon is the largest among the population of bodies that are sources of dust in this ring in april 2014 nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring ring shepherds shepherd satellites are small moons that orbit within or just beyond a planets ring system they have the effect of sculpting the rings giving them sharp edges and creating gaps between them saturns shepherd moons are pan encke gap daphnis keeler gap atlas a ring prometheus f ring and pandora f ring these moons together with co-orbitals see below probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores the cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated co-orbitals janus and epimetheus are called co-orbital moons they are of roughly equal size with janus being slightly larger than epimetheus janus and epimetheus have orbits with only a few kilometers difference in semi-major axis close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other instead of colliding however their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years inner large moons the innermost large moons of saturn orbit within its tenuous e ring along with three smaller moons of the alkyonides group mimas is the smallest and least massive of the inner round moons although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of methone it is noticeably ovoid-shaped having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator by about 20km by the effects of saturns gravity mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter herschel situated on its leading hemisphere mimas has no known past or present geologic activity and its surface is dominated by impact craters the only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs which probably formed when mimas was shattered by the herschel impact enceladus is one of the smallest of saturns moons that is spherical in shapeonly mimas is smalleryet is the only small saturnian moon that is currently endogenously active and the smallest known body in the solar system that is geologically active today its surface is morphologically diverse it includes ancient heavily cratered terrain as well as younger smooth areas with few impact craters many plains on enceladus are fractured and intersected by systems of lineaments the area around its south pole was found by cassini to be unusually warm and cut by a system of fractures about 130km long called tiger stripes some of which emit jets of water vapor and dust these jets form a large plume off its south pole which replenishes saturns e ring and serves as the main source of ions in the magnetosphere of saturn the gas and dust are released with a rate of more than 100kgs enceladus may have liquid water underneath the south-polar surface the source of the energy for this cryovolcanism is thought to be a 21 mean-motion resonance with dione the pure ice on the surface makes enceladus one of the brightest known objects in the solar systemits geometrical albedo is more than 140 tethys is the third largest of saturns inner moons its most prominent features are a large 400km diameter impact crater named odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named ithaca chasma extending at least 270 around tethys the ithaca chasma is concentric with odysseus and these two features may be related tethys appears to have no current geological activity a heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies the majority of its surface while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of odysseus the plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger a sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain there is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from odysseus the density of tethys 0985gcm is less than that of water indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with only a small fraction of rock dione is the second-largest inner moon of saturn it has a higher density than the geologically dead rhea the largest inner moon but lower than that of active enceladus while the majority of diones surface is heavily cratered old terrain this moon is also covered with an extensive network of troughs and lineaments indicating that in the past it had global tectonic activity the troughs and lineaments are especially prominent on the trailing hemisphere where several intersecting sets of fractures form what is called wispy terrain the cratered plains have a few large impact craters reaching 250km in diameter smooth plains with low impact-crater counts are also present on a small fraction of its surface they were probably tectonically resurfaced relatively later in the geological history of dione at two locations within smooth plains strange landforms depressions resembling oblong impact craters have been identified both of which lie at the centers of radiating networks of cracks and troughs these features may be cryovolcanic in origin dione may be geologically active even now although on a scale much smaller than the cryovolcanism of enceladus this follows from cassini magnetic measurements that show dione is a net source of plasma in the magnetosphere of saturn much like enceladus alkyonides three small moons orbit between mimas and enceladus methone anthe and pallene named after the alkyonides of greek mythology they are some of the smallest moons in the saturn system anthe and methone have very faint ring arcs along their orbits whereas pallene has a faint complete ring of these three moons only methone has been photographed at close range showing it to be egg-shaped with very few or no craters trojan moons trojan moons are a unique feature only known from the saturnian system a trojan body orbits at either the leading l4 or trailing l5 lagrange point of a much larger object such as a large moon or planet tethys has two trojan moons telesto leading and calypso trailing and dione also has two helene leading and polydeuces trailing helene is by far the largest trojan moon while polydeuces is the smallest and has the most chaotic orbit these moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothed out their surfaces outer large moons these moons all orbit beyond the e ring they are rhea is the second-largest of saturns moons in 2005 cassini detected a depletion of electrons in the plasma wake of rhea which forms when the co-rotating plasma of saturns magnetosphere is absorbed by the moon the depletion was hypothesized to be caused by the presence of dust-sized particles concentrated in a few faint equatorial rings such a ring system would make rhea the only moon in the solar system known to have rings however subsequent targeted observations of the putative ring plane from several angles by cassinis narrow-angle camera turned up no evidence of the expected ring material leaving the origin of the plasma observations unresolved otherwise rhea has rather a typical heavily cratered surface with the exceptions of a few large dione-type fractures wispy terrain on the trailing hemisphere and a very faint line of material at the equator that may have been deposited by material deorbiting from present or former rings rhea also has two very large impact basins on its anti-saturnian hemisphere which are about 400 and 500km across the first tirawa is roughly comparable to the odysseus basin on tethys there is also a 48km-diameter impact crater called inktomi at 112w that is prominent because of an extended system of bright rays which may be one of the youngest craters on the inner moons of saturn no evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered on the surface of rhea titan at 5149km diameter is the second largest moon in the solar system and saturns largest out of all the large moons titan is the only one with a dense surface pressure of 15atm cold atmosphere primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane the dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds especially over the south pole region on june 6 2013 scientists at the iaa-csic reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of titan on june 23 2014 nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier times the surface of titan which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young it contains a pattern of light and dark regions flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons titan is the only body in the solar system beside earth with bodies of liquid on its surface in the form of methaneethane lakes in titans north and south polar regions the largest lake kraken mare is larger than the caspian sea like europa and ganymede it is believed that titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism on july 2 2014 nasa reported the ocean inside titan may be as salty as the earths dead sea hyperion is titans nearest neighbor in the saturn system the two moons are locked in a 43 mean-motion resonance with each other meaning that while titan makes four revolutions around saturn hyperion makes exactly three with an average diameter of about 270km hyperion is smaller and lighter than mimas it has an extremely irregular shape and a very odd tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge though its interior may be partially porous as well the average density of about 055gcm indicates that the porosity exceeds 40 even assuming it has a purely icy composition the surface of hyperion is covered with numerous impact cratersthose with diameters 210km are especially abundant it is the only moon besides the small moons of pluto known to have a chaotic rotation which means hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator while on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis at a rate of 7275 per day on longer timescales its axis of rotation spin vector wanders chaotically across the sky this makes the rotational behavior of hyperion essentially unpredictable iapetus is the third-largest of saturns moons orbiting the planet at 35 million km it is by far the most distant of saturns large moons and also has the largest orbital inclination at 1547 iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface its leading hemisphere is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as fresh snow cassini images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called cassini regio which extends approximately from 40n to 40s the pole regions of iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere cassini also discovered a 20km tall equatorial ridge which spans nearly the moons entire equator otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of iapetus are old and heavily cratered the images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550km and numerous smaller impact craters no evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered a clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of iapetuss starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009 when nasas spitzer space telescope discovered a vast nearly invisible disk around saturn just inside the orbit of the moon phoebe the phoebe ring scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on phoebe because the disk particles like phoebe itself orbit in the opposite direction to iapetus iapetus collides with them as they drift in the direction of saturn darkening its leading hemisphere slightly once a difference in albedo and hence in average temperature was established between different regions of iapetus a thermal runaway process of water ice sublimation from warmer regions and deposition of water vapor onto colder regions ensued iapetuss present two-toned appearance results from the contrast between the bright primarily ice-coated areas and regions of dark lag the residue left behind after the loss of surface ice irregular moons irregular moons are small satellites with large-radii inclined and frequently retrograde orbits believed to have been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process they often occur as collisional families or groups the precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope although the latter is usually assumed to be quite lowaround 6 albedo of phoebe or less the irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands they are neutral or moderately red in colorsimilar to c-type p-type or d-type asteroids though they are much less red than kuiper belt objects inuit group the inuit group includes five prograde outer moons that are similar enough in their distances from the planet 186297 radii of saturn their orbital inclinations 4550 and their colors that they can be considered a group the moons are ijiraq kiviuq paaliaq siarnaq and tarqeq the largest among them is siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km gallic group the gallic group are four prograde outer moons that are similar enough in their distance from the planet 207302 radii of saturn their orbital inclination 3540 and their color that they can be considered a group they are albiorix bebhionn erriapus and tarvos tarvos as of 2009 is the most distant of saturns moons with a prograde orbit the largest among these moons is albiorix with an estimated size of about 32km norse group the norse or phoebe group consists of 29 retrograde outer moons they are aegir bergelmir bestla farbauti fenrir fornjot greip hati hyrrokkin jarnsaxa kari loge mundilfari narvi phoebe skathi skoll surtur suttungr thrymr ymir

the norse group may itself consist of several smaller subgroups phoebe at 700521300000000000021314km in diameter is by far the largest of saturns irregular satellites it has a retrograde orbit and rotates on its axis every 93 hours phoebe was the first moon of saturn to be studied in detail by cassini in june 2004 during this encounter cassini was able to map nearly 90 of the moons surface phoebe has a nearly spherical shape and a relatively high density of about 16gcm cassini images revealed a dark surface scarred by numerous impactsthere are about 130 craters with diameters exceeding 10km spectroscopic measurement showed that the surface is made of water ice carbon dioxide phyllosilicates organics and possibly iron bearing minerals phoebe is believed to be a captured centaur that originated in the kuiper belt it also serves as a source of material for the largest known ring of saturn which darkens the leading hemisphere of iapetus see above list confirmed moons unconfirmed moons the following objects observed by cassini have not been confirmed as solid bodies it is not yet clear if these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the f ring hypothetical moons two moons were claimed to be discovered by different astronomers but never seen again both moons were said to orbit between titan and hyperion chiron which was supposedly sighted by hermann goldschmidt in 1861 but never observed by anyone else themis was allegedly discovered in 1905 by astronomer william pickering but never seen again nevertheless it was included in numerous almanacs and astronomy books until the 1960s formation it is thought that the saturnian system of titan mid-sized moons and rings developed from a set-up closer to the galilean moons of jupiter though the details are unclear it has been proposed either that a second titan-sized moon broke up producing the rings and inner mid-sized moons or that two large moons fused to form titan with the collision scattering icy debris that formed the mid-sized moons on june 23 2014 nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier times studies based on enceladuss tidal-based geologic activity and the lack of evidence of extensive past resonances in tethys dione and rheas
