legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude legend for its active and passive participants includes no happenings that are outside the realm of possibility but may include miracles legends may be transformed over time in order to keep them fresh vital and realistic many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty never being entirely believed by the participants but also never being resolutely doubted the brothers grimm defined legend as folktale historically grounded a modern folklorists professional definition of legend was proposed by timothy r tangherlini in 1990 legend typically is a short mono- episodic traditional highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs etymology and origin legend is a loanword from old french that entered english usage circa 1340 the old french noun legende derives from the medieval latin legenda in its early english-language usage the word indicated a narrative of an event the word legendary was originally a noun introduced in the 1510s meaning a collection or corpus of legends this word changed to legendry and legendary became the adjectival form by 1613 english-speaking protestants began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in john foxes actes and monuments was fictitious thus legend gained its modern connotations of undocumented and spurious which distinguish it from the meaning of chronicle in 1866 jacob grimm described the fairy tale as poetic legend historic early scholars such as karl wehrhande friedrich ranke and will erich peuckert followed grimms example in focussing solely on the literary narrative an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends social context questions of categorising legends in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the aarnethompson folktale index provoked a search for a broader new synthesis in an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales friedrich rankede in 1925 characterised the folk legend as a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned compared to the highly structured folktale legend is comparatively amorphous helmut de boor noted in 1928 the narrative content of legend is in realistic mode rather than the wry irony of folktale wilhelm heiske remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that in spite of its realistic mode legend is not more historical than folktale in einleitung in der geschichtswissenschaft 1928 ernst bernheim asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour gordon allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise thus urban legends are a feature of rumour when willian jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were short-term legends and the persistent ones be termed long-term legends the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated tangherlini concluded christian legenda in the narrow christian sense legenda things to be read on a certain day in church were hagiographical accounts often collected in a legendary because saints lives are often included in many miracle stories legend in a wider sense came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains supernatural divine or fantastic elements related concepts hippolyte delehaye distinguished legend from myth the legend on the other hand has of necessity some historical or topographical connection it refers imaginary events to some real personage or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot from the moment a legend is retold as fiction its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede in the legend of sleepy hollow washington irving transformed a local hudson river valley legend into a literary anecdote with gothic overtones which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend stories that exceed the boundaries of realism are called fables for example the talking animal formula of aesop identifies his brief stories as fables not legends the parable of the prodigal son would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father if it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the prodigal son it would be a fable legend may be transmitted orally passed on person-to-person or in the original sense through written text jacob de voragines legenda aurea or the golden legend comprises a series of vitae or instructive biographical narratives tied to the liturgical calendar of the roman catholic church they are presented as lives of the saints but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of hagiography the legenda was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the saint of the day urban legend the vanishing hitchhiker is the best-known urban legend in america traceable as far back as 1870 but it is found around the world including in korea
