mountainous area of the thai highlands with the highest point being doi inthanon in the thanon thong chai range at 2565 metres 8415ft above sea level the northeast isan consists of the khorat plateau bordered to the east by the mekong river the centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat chao phraya river valley which runs into the gulf of thailand southern thailand consists of the narrow kra isthmus that widens into the malay peninsula politically there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population basic resources natural features and level of social and economic development the diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of thailands physical setting the chao phraya and the mekong river are the indispensable water courses of rural thailand industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries the gulf of thailand covers 320000 square kilometres 124000sqmi and is fed by the chao phraya mae klong bang pakong and tapi rivers it contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the kra isthmus the eastern shore of the gulf of thailand is

popular and luxurious resorts in asia phuket krabi ranong phang nga and trang and their islands all lay along the coasts of the andaman sea and despite the 2004 tsunami they remain a tourist magnet for visitors from around the world plans have resurfaced for a canal which would connect the andaman sea to the gulf of thailand analogous to the suez and the panama canals the idea has been greeted positively by thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the ports of singapore improve ties with china and india lower shipping times and eliminate pirate attacks in the strait of malacca and support the thai governments policy of being the logistical hub for southeast asia the canal it is claimed would improve economic conditions in the south of thailand which relies heavily on tourism income and it would also change the structure of the thai economy by making it an asia logistical hub the canal would be a major engineering project and has an expected cost of us2030 billion climate thailands climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character the southwest and northeast monsoon the southwest monsoon which starts from may until october is characterized by movement of warm moist air from the indian ocean to thailand causing abundant rain over most of the country the northeast monsoon starting from october until february brings cold and dry air from china over most of thailand in southern thailand the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region most of thailand has a tropical wet and dry or savanna climate type kppens tropical savanna climate the south and the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate thailand is divided into three seasons the first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season midmay to midoctober which prevails over most of the country this season is characterized by abundant rain with august and september being the wettest period of the year this can occasionally lead to floods in addition to rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon the intertropical convergence zone itcz and tropical cyclones also contribute to producing heavy rainfall during the rainy season nonetheless dry spells commonly occur for 1 to 2 weeks from june to early july this is due to the northward movement of the intertropical convergence zone to southern china winter or the northeast monsoon starts from midoctober until midfebruary most of thailand experiences dry weather during this season with mild temperatures the exception is the southern parts of thailand where it receives abundant rainfall particularly during october to november summer or the premonsoon season runs from midfebruary until midmay and is characterized by warmer weather due to its inland nature and latitude the north northeast central and eastern parts of thailand experience a long period of warm weather during the hottest time of the year march to may temperatures usually reach up to 40c 104f or more with the exception of coastal areas where sea breezes moderate afternoon temperatures in contrast outbreaks of cold air from china can bring colder temperatures in some cases particularly the north and northeast close to or below 0c 32f southern thailand is characterized by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences most of the country receives a mean annual rainfall of 1200 to 1600mm 47 to 63in however certain areas on the windward sides of mountains such as ranong province in the west coast of southern thailand and eastern parts of trat province receive more than 4500mm 180in of rainfall per year the driest areas are on the leeward side in the central valleys and northernmost portion of south thailand where mean annual rainfall is less than 1200mm 47in most of thailand north northeast central and east is characterized by dry weather during the northeast monsoon and abundant rainfall during the southwest monsoon in the southern parts of thailand abundant rainfall occurs in both the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons with a peak in september for the western coast and a peak in novemberjanuary on

also a mediocre rank in the asia pacific region specifically but ahead of countries like indonesia and china the epi was established in 2001 by the world economic forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the united nations sustainable development goals the environmental areas where thailand performs worst ie highest ranking are air quality 167

elephants in thailand in 1850 the population of elephants has dropped to an estimated 2000 poachers have long hunted elephants for ivory and hides and now increasingly for meat young elephants are often captured for use in tourist attractions or as work animals although their use has declined since the government banned logging in 1989 there are now more elephants in captivity than in the wild and environmental activists claim that elephants in captivity are often mistreated poaching of protected species remains a major problem hunters have decimated the populations of tigers leopards and other large cats for their valuable pelts many animals including tigers bears crocodiles and king cobras are farmed or hunted for their meat which is considered a delicacy and for their supposed medicinal properties although such trade is illegal the famous bangkok market chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered species the practice of keeping wild animals as pets threatens several

transsexual patients visited thailand for sex-reassignment surgery in more recent years 20102012 more than 90 of the visitors traveled to thailand for srs agriculture forty-nine per cent of thailands labour force is employed in agriculture this is down from 70 in 1980 rice is the most important crop in the country and thailand had long been the worlds leading exporter of rice until recently falling behind both india and vietnam thailand has the highest percentage of arable land 2725 of any nation in the greater mekong subregion about 55 of the arable land area is used for rice production agriculture has been experiencing a transition from labour-intensive and transitional methods to a more industrialised and competitive sector between 1962 and 1983 the agricultural sector grew by 41 per year on average and continued to grow at 22 between 1983 and 2007 the relative contribution of agriculture to gdp has declined while exports of goods and services have increased energy 75 of thailands electrical generation is powered by natural gas in 2014 coal-fired power plants produce an additional 20 of electricity with the remainder coming from biomass hydro and biogas thailand produces roughly one-third of the oil it consumes it is the second largest importer of oil in se asia thailand is a large producer of natural gas with reserves of at least 10 trillion cubic feet after indonesia it is the largest coal producer in se asia but must import additional coal to meet domestic demand informal economy thailand has an diverse and robust informal labor sectorin 2012 it was estimated that informal workers comprised 626 of the thai workforce the ministry of labor defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given countrys labor protection act lpa the informal sector in thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of thailands gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialized and service-oriented between 19931995 ten percent of the thai labor force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs especially in the manufacturing sector it is estimated that between 19881995 the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million as thailands gdp tripled while the asian financial crisis that followed in 1997 hit the thai economy hard the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation as thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the imf and world bank these reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatization and trade liberalization in the country and decreased federal subsidization of public goods and utilities agricultural price supports and regulations on fair wages and labor conditions these changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities many migrant farmers found work in thailands growing manufacturing industry and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labor regulations and often exploitative conditions those that could not find formal factory work including illegal migrants and the families of rural thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centers turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survivalunder the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of thailands labor reforms in the wake of the 1997 asian financial crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state this can be described as the externalization of market risk meaning that as the countrys labor market became increasingly deregulated the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidize the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector the weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result today informal labor in thailand is typically broken down into three main groups subcontractedself employedhome-based workers service workers including those that are employed in restaurants as street vendors masseuses taxi drivers and as domestic workers and agricultural workers not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment nightlife and the sex industry individuals employed in these facets of the informal labor sector face additional vulnerabilities including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking in general education levels are low in the informal sector a 2012 study found that 64 of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school many informal workers are also migrants only some of which have legal status in the country education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries and enjoy the labor protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment because the informal labor sector is not recognized under the labor protection act lpa informal workers are much more vulnerable labor to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognized industries while some thai labor laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers they are often weak and difficult to enforce furthermore thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment and many do not make a living wage as a result labor trafficking is common in the region affecting children and adults men and women and migrants and thai citizens alike demographics thailand had a population of 68863514 as of 2016 thailands population is largely rural concentrated in the rice-growing areas of the central northeastern
