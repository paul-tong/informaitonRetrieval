a hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag called an envelope which contains heated air suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons a capsule which carries passengers and a source of heat in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane the heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope as with all aircraft hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere unlike gas balloons the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air in modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon closest to the burner flame is made from a fire resistant material such as nomex modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications the hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology the first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by jean-franois piltre de rozier and franois laurent darlandes on november 21 1783 in paris france in a balloon created by the montgolfier brothers the first hot-air balloon flown in the americas was launched from the walnut street jail in philadelphia on january 9 1793 by the french aeronaut jean pierre blanchard hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships history premodern and unmanned balloons early unmanned hot air balloons were used in china zhuge liang of the shu han kingdom during the three kingdoms era 220280 ad used airborne lanterns for military signaling these lanterns are known as chinese lanterns simplified chinese traditional chinese in the 18th century the portuguese jesuit priest bartolomeu de gusmo envisioned an aerial apparatus called passarola which was the predecessor of the hot air balloon the purpose of passarola was to serve as air vessel in order to facilitate communication and as a strategical device in 1709 john v of portugal decided to fund bartolomeu de gusmos project following a petition made by the jesuit priest and an unmanned demonstration was performed at casa da india in presence of john v the queen maria anna of austria having as witnesses the italian cardinal michelangelo conti two members of the portuguese royal academy of history one portuguese diplomat and one chronicler this event would bring some european attention to this event and this project a later article dated on october 20 1786 by the london daily universal register would state that the inventor was able to raise himself by the use of his prototype also in 1709 the portuguese jesuit wrote manifesto summrio para os que ignoram poderse navegar pelo elemento do ar short manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air persecuted by the inquisition he was prevented from continuing his research however he left designs for a manned air vessel first manned flight the french brothers joseph-michel and jacques-tienne montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in annonay ardeche france and demonstrated it publicly on september 19 1783 making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes after experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals the first balloon flight with humans aboard a tethered flight performed on or around october 15 1783 by jean-francois pilatre de rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the reveillon workshop in the faubourg saint-antoine later that same day pilatre de rozier became the second human to ascend into the air reaching an altitude of 26m 85ft the length of the tether the first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later on november 21 1783 king louis xvi had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots but de rozier along with marquis franois darlandes petitioned successfully for the honor the first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of fleurus when the french used the balloon lentreprenant for observation today modern hot air balloons with an onboard heat source were developed by ed yost beginning during the 1950s his work resulted in his first successful flight on october 22 1960 the first modern hot air balloon to be made in the united kingdom uk was the bristol belle built in 1967 presently hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes on november 26 2005 vijaypat singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight reaching 21027m 68986ft he took off from downtown mumbai india and landed 240km 150mi south in panchale the previous record of 19811m 64997ft had been set by per lindstrand on june 6 1988 in plano texas on january 15 1991 the virgin pacific flyer balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when per lindstrand born in sweden but resident in the uk and richard branson of the uk flew 767191km 476710mi from japan to northern canada with a volume of 74000 cubic meters 26 million cubic feet the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams the pacific flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245mph 394kmh the longest duration record was set by swiss psychiatrist bertrand piccard auguste piccards grandson and briton brian jones flying in the breitling orbiter 3 it was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon the balloon left chteau-doex switzerland on march 1 1999 and landed at 102am on march 21 in the egyptian desert 300 miles 480km south of cairo the two men exceeded distance endurance and time records traveling 19 days 21 hours and 55 minutes steve fossett flying solo exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 july 2002 on his sixth attempt in 320 h 33 min fedor konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-airhelium balloon from 11 to 23 july 2016 for a round-the world time of 272h 11m as of 17september2016 awaiting official confirmation as the new record construction a hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered fabric gas bag lifting envelope with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat attached to the envelope is a basket or gondola for carrying the passengers mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the burner which injects a flame into the envelope heating the air within the heater or burner is fueled by propane a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels similar to high pressure forklift cylinders envelope modern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron a polyester during the manufacturing process the material is cut into panels and sewn together along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket the individual sections which extend from the throat to the crown top of the envelope are known as gores or gore sections envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more envelopes often have a crown ring at their very top this is a hoop of smooth metal usually aluminium and approximately 1ft 030m in diameter vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring at the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables one cable per load tape these cables often referred to as flying wires are connected to the basket by carabiners seams the most common technique for sewing panels together is called the french felled french fell or double lap seam the two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge possibly with a load tape as well and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching other methods include a flat lap seam in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching and a zigzag where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric coatings the fabric or at least part of it the top 13 for example may be coated with a sealer such as silicone or polyurethane to make it impermeable to air it is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope not weakening of the fabric itself heat moisture and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation once an envelope becomes too porous to fly it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a rag bag cold inflated and opened for children to run through products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially sizes and capacity a range of envelope sizes is available the smallest one-person basket-less balloons called hoppers or cloudhoppers have as little as 600m 21000cuft of envelope volume for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5m 16ft at the other end of the scale balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people with envelope volumes of up to 17000m 600000cuft the most-used size is about 2800m 99000cuft and can carry 3 to 5 people vents the top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent start a descent or increase the rate of descent usually for landing some hot air balloons have turning vents which are side vents that when opened cause the balloon to rotate such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing the most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a parachute vent invented by tracy barnes the fabric is connected around its edge to a set of vent lines that converge in the center the arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachutethus the name these vent lines are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket a parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line once the control line is released the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place a parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally the vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing an older and presently less commonly used style of top vent is called a velcro-style vent this too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon however rather than having a set of vent lines that can repeatedly open and close the vent the vent is secured by hook and loop fasteners such as velcro and is only opened at the end of the flight balloons equipped with a velcro-style vent typically have a second maneuvering vent built into the side as opposed to the top of the balloon another common type of top design is the smart vent which rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the parachute type gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening this system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing of particular value in high winds other designs such as the pop top and multivent systems have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system shape besides special shapes possibly for marketing purposes there are several variations on the traditional inverted tear drop shape the simplest often used by home builders is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone more-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account this shape may be referred to as natural finally some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag in the vertical direction to improve flight performance in competitions basket baskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan these materials have proven to be sufficiently light strong and durable for balloon flight such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape they vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out baskets may also be made of aluminium especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin to reduce weight or increase portability these may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude duration or distance records other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger burner the burner unit gasifies liquid propane mixes it with air ignites the mixture and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope burners vary in power output each will generally produce 2 to 3 mw of heat 7 to 10 million btus per hour with double triple or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed the pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve known as a blast valve the valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically or it may stay open until closed by the pilot the burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture the pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device such as a flint striker or a lighter or with a built-in piezo electric spark where more than one burner is present the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane the burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope or supported rigidly over the basket the burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric a burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound this is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them it also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve fuel tanks propane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium stainless steel or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel they may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge common tank sizes are 10 38 15 57 and 20 76 us gallons liters they may be intended for upright or horizontal use and may be mounted inside or outside the basket the pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself if warm enough or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight instrumentation a balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot these commonly include an altimeter a rate of climb vertical speed indicator known as a variometer envelope air temperature and ambient air temperature a gps receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless and direction combined mass the combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows using a density of 09486kgm for dry air heated to 210f 99c theory of operation generating lift increasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding ambient air the balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it this force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by archimedes principle the amount of lift or buoyancy provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope for most envelopes made of nylon fabric the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120c 250f it should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature about 230c 450f but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time with a maximum operating temperature of 120c 250f balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life the lift generated by 100000ft 28317m of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows the density of air at 20c 68f is about 12kgm the total lift for a balloon of 100000ft heated to 99c 210f would be 1595lb 7235kg this is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass not including the heated air trapped in the envelope of course stated in the previous section liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature depending on the desired rate of climb in reality the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature as the accompanying thermal image shows and so these calculations are based on averages for typical atmospheric conditions 20c 68f a hot air balloon heated to 99c 210f requires about 391m of envelope volume to lift 1kilogram 625ftlb the precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above but the external temperature altitude above sea level and humidity of the air surrounding on a warm day a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric also in the lower atmosphere the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3 for each 1000meters 1 per 1000ft of altitude gained montgolfier standard hot air balloons are known as montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope this style of balloon was developed by the montgolfier brothers and had its first public demonstration on 4 june 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes followed later that year with manned flights hybrid the 1785 rozire balloon a type of hybrid balloon named after its creator jean-franois piltre de rozier has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas typically helium as well as a cone below for hot air as is used in a hot air balloon to heat the helium at night hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas all modern roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting gas solar solar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside steering hot air balloon can be steered to a limited degree by changing the altitude of the flight wind in the northern hemisphere tends to turn right due to coriolis effect as the altitude increases safety equipment to help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment in the basket to relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition such as a flint spark lighter many systems especially those that carry passengers have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems two fuel tanks connected to two separate hoses which feed two distinct burners this enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak a fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful most balloons carry a 1 or 2 kg abe type fire extinguisher a handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries this is a rope or webbing of 2030 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end in very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground for commercial passenger balloons a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries this consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing further safety equipment may include a first-aid kit a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife on the occupants at a minimum the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber such as nomex gloves so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak even if there is a flame present quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience the pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs either natural fiber such as cotton linen hemp or wool or engineered flame-retardant fiber such as nomex is acceptable in this capacity most engineered fibers with the exception of rayon which is also safe to wear are thermoplastic many are also hydrocarbons this makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer and most hydrocarbons whether fibrous or not are suitable to use as fuels natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support finally some balloon systems especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers on the ground crew the ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines the mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement the ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain maintenance and repair as with aircraft hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy as aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags while some operations such as cleaning and drying may be performed by the owner or pilot other operations such as sewing must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloons maintenance log book maintenance to ensure long life and safe operation the envelope should be kept clean and dry this prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing transport and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles in the event of a landing in a wet because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew or muddy location farmers field the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry the burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced the wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair the skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement balloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturers maintenance schedule that includes regular 100 flight hours or 12 month inspections in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage in australia balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops repair in the case of a snag burn or rip in the envelope fabric a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced patches may be held in place with glue tape stitching or a combination of these techniques replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique thread and stitch pattern licensing depending on the size of the balloon location and intended use hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations balloons as with other aircraft in the usa balloons must be registered have an n-number have an airworthiness certificate and pass annual inspections balloons below a certain size empty weight of less than 155pounds or 70kg including envelope basket burners and empty fuel tanks can be used as an ultralight aircraft pilots in australia in australia private balloon pilots are managed by the australian ballooning federation and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an air operators certificate from the australian civil aviation and safety authority casa with a nominated chief pilot pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with casa and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel in the uk in the uk the person in command must hold a valid private pilots licence issued by the civil aviation authority specifically for ballooning this is known as the pplb there are two types of commercial balloon licences cplb restricted and cplb full the cplb restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon the pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a ppl unless asked to attend any event then a cplb restricted is required the cplb is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money the balloon then needs a transport category c of a certificate of air worthiness if the pilot is only flying sponsors guests and not charging money for flying other passengers then the pilot is exempted from holding an aoc air operators certificate though a copy of it is required for passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log in the united states in the united states a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the federal aviation administration faa and it must carry the rating of lighter-than-air free balloon and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons will also carry this limitation limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater a pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft but training is highly advised and some hot air balloons meet the criteria to carry paying passengers for hire and attend some balloon festivals a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors while most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights while others fly corporate advertising balloons accidents and incidents 1989 alice springs hot air balloon crash on 4 13 august 1989 two hot air balloons

manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is cameron balloons company of bristol england which also owns lindstrand balloons of oswestry england cameron balloons lindstrand balloons and another english balloon manufacturing company thunder and colt since acquired by cameron have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons these hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloons ability to stay aloft the second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is ultramagic company based in spain which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year ultramagic can produce very large balloons such as the n-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket and has also produced many balloons with special shapes as well as cold-air inflatables in the usa aerostar international inc of sioux falls south dakota was north americas largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in january 2007 the oldest us certified manufacture is now adams balloons out of albuquerque new
