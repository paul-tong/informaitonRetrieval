ocean exploration is a part of oceanography describing the exploration of ocean surfaces notable explorations were undertaken by the greeks the egyptians the polynesians the phoenicians phytheas herodotus the vikings the portuguese and muslims scientific investigationsing navigation depth measurement exploration and cartography timeline early exploration 130000 bc researchers working on the island of crete discover stone tools indicating ocean exploration capabilities of early humans dating to at least 130000 years ago 4500 bc around this time cultures like those in greece and china began diving into the sea as a source of food gathering commerce and possibly even warfare 4000 bc egyptians developed sailing vessels which were probably used only in the eastern mediterranean near the mouth of the nile river 4000 bc - 1000 ad polynesian colonization of south pacific islands 1800 bc basic measuring of the depths is done in egypt 1500 bc middle eastern peoples explored the indian ocean 600 bc phoenicians developed sea routes around the entire mediterranean and into the red sea and the indian ocean going around africa they reached england by sailing along the western european coast although they understood celestial navigation they probably stayed within sight of land whenever possible 500-200 bc greeks developed trade routes in the mediterranean using the length of the day corrected for the time of the year to estimate latitude 450 bc herodotus publishes a map of the mediterranean region 325 bc pytheas a greek astronomer and geographer sailed north out of the mediterranean reaching england and possibly even iceland and norway he also developed the use of sightings on the north star to determine latitude c240 bc eratosthenes of alexandria egypt determines fairly accurately the circumference of the earth using angles of shadows in syene and alexandria 150 ad ptolemy produces a map of the roman world including lines of latitude and longitude the continents of asia europe and africa and the surrounding oceans 900-1430 vikings explore and colonize iceland greenland newfoundland 1002 leif erikson reaches north america 500 years before columbus 1405-1433 chinese send seven voyages to extend chinese influence and impress their neighbor states these expensive voyages are ended after a short time see zheng he 13711433 from age of exploration to present 1492-1504 christopher columbus reaches america looking for a searoute to the indies discovering various lands and islands and establishing a colony on hispaniola 1498 vasco da gama sails around africa from portugal reaching india and establishing trade routes 1499-1504 amerigo vespucci explores new world 1519-1522 ferdinand magellans ships circumnavigate the world 1620 dutch inventor cornelis drebbel builds the worlds first submarine and makes several trips in the river thames near london at a depth of about 12 or 15 feet 1698-1700 edmund halley made probably the first primarily scientific voyage to study the variation of the magnetic compass sailing as far as 52 deg s in the atlantic ocean on a previous expedition to st helena he made an important contribution to knowledge of the trade winds 1768-1780 james cook explores the southern parts of the oceans looking for the southern continent he was the first to use a marine chronometer to determine longitude 1785 benjamin franklin writes sundry marine observations on improvements to ships and the gulf stream 1831-1836 charles darwin sails on the beagle exploring the galapagos and many other areas it is this work which led him to develop the concepts of natural selection and evolution 1860 first chart of the gulf stream published by the us coast survey 1872-1876 hms challenger travels around the world on a scientific mission taking sediment samples water samples soundings and collecting many biological specimens 1960 bathyscaphe trieste dives to what was believed to be the deepest point in the mariana trench a depth of 10915 meters was observed 1969 the ben franklin px-15 drifts submerged for 30 days in the gulf stream see also deep-sea exploration ocean oceanography exploration office of ocean exploration list of explorers list of maritime explorers sources noaa interactive timeline of significant and interesting events throughout the 200-year history of noaa and its predecessor organizations seaskyorg - ocean exploration timeline with credits sources noaa - sounding pole to sea beam history of ocean exploration usc earth sciences history of oceanography skbs virtual cave - notable oceanographic expeditions ocean explorer - public outreach site for explorations sponsored by the office of ocean exploration noaa ocean explorer history noaa ocean explorer gallery - a rich collection of images video audio and podcast noaas office of ocean exploration deep-sea exploration
