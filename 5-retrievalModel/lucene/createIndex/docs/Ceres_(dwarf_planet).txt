ceres sriz minor-planet designation 1 ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of mars and jupiter slightly closer to marss orbit with a diameter of 945km 587mi ceres is the largest of the minor planets and the only dwarf planet inside neptunes orbit it is the 33rd-largest known body in the solar system ceres is composed of rock and ice and is estimated to comprise approximately one-third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity though detailed analysis was required to exclude vesta from earth the apparent magnitude of ceres ranges from 67 to 93 peaking once in opposition every 15 to 16 months its synodic period thus even at its brightest it appears too dim to be seen by the naked eye except under extremely dark skies ceres was the first asteroid to be discovered by giuseppe piazzi at palermo astronomical observatory on 1 january 1801 it was originally considered a planet but was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after many other objects in similar orbits were discovered ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice the surface is a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay in january 2014 emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of ceres this was unexpected because large bodies in the asteroid belt typically do not emit vapor a hallmark of comets the robotic nasa spacecraft dawn entered orbit around ceres on 6 march 2015 pictures with a resolution previously unattained were taken during imaging sessions starting in january 2015 as dawn approached ceres showing a cratered surface two distinct bright spots or high-albedo features inside a crater different from the bright spots observed in earlier hubble images were seen in a 19 february 2015 image leading to speculation about a possible cryovolcanic origin or outgassing on 3 march 2015 a nasa spokesperson said the spots are consistent with highly reflective materials containing ice or salts but that cryovolcanism is unlikely however on 2 september 2016 scientists from the dawn team claimed in a science paper that a massive cryovolcano called ahuna mons is the strongest evidence yet for the existence of these mysterious formations on 11 may 2015 nasa released a higher-resolution image showing that instead of one or two spots there are actually several on 9 december 2015 nasa scientists reported that the bright spots on ceres may be related to a type of salt particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite mgso46h2o the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays in june 2016 near-infrared spectra of these bright areas were found to be consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate na 2co 3 implying that recent geologic activity was probably involved in the creation of the bright spots in july 2018 nasa released a comparison of physical features found on ceres with similar ones present on earth from june to october 2018 dawn orbited ceres from as close as 35km 22mi and as far away as 4000km 2500mi the dawn mission ended on 1 november 2018 after the spacecraft ran out of fuel in october 2015 nasa released a true-color portrait of ceres made by dawn in february 2017 organics tholins were detected on ceres in ernutet crater see image history discovery johann elert bode in 1772 first suggested that an undiscovered planet could exist between the orbits of mars and jupiter kepler had already noticed the gap between mars and jupiter in 1596 bode based his idea on the titiusbode law which is a now-discredited hypothesis that was first proposed in 1766 bode observed that there was a regular pattern in the semi-major axes of the orbits of known planets and that the pattern was marred only by the large gap between mars and jupiter the pattern predicted that the missing planet ought to have an orbit with a semi-major axis near 28 astronomical units au william herschels discovery of uranus in 1781 near the predicted distance for the next body beyond saturn increased faith in the law of titius and bode and in 1800 a group headed by franz xaver von zach editor of the monatliche correspondenz sent requests to twenty-four experienced astronomers whom he dubbed the celestial police asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet although they did not discover ceres they later found several large asteroids one of the astronomers selected for the search was giuseppe piazzi a catholic priest at the academy of palermo sicily before receiving his invitation to join the group piazzi discovered ceres on 1 january 1801 he was searching for the 87th star of the catalogue of the zodiacal stars of mr la caille but found that it was preceded by another instead of a star piazzi had found a moving star-like object which he first thought was a comet piazzi observed ceres a total of 24 times the final time on 11 february 1801 when illness interrupted his observations he announced his discovery on 24 january 1801 in letters to only two fellow astronomers his compatriot barnaba oriani of milan and johann elert bode of berlin he reported it as a comet but since its movement is so slow and rather uniform it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet in april piazzi sent his complete observations to oriani bode and jrme lalande in paris the information was published in the september 1801 issue of the monatliche correspondenz by this time the apparent position of ceres had changed mostly due to earths orbital motion and was too close to the suns glare for other astronomers to confirm piazzis observations toward the end of the year ceres should have been visible again but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position to recover ceres carl friedrich gauss then 24 years old developed an efficient method of orbit determination in only a few weeks he predicted the path of ceres and sent his results to von zach on 31 december 1801 von zach and heinrich w m olbers found ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it the early observers were only able to calculate the size of ceres to within an order of magnitude herschel underestimated its diameter as 260km in 1802 whereas in 1811 johann hieronymus schrter overestimated it as 2613km name piazzi originally suggested the name cerere ferdinandea for his discovery after the goddess ceres roman goddess of agriculture cerere in italian who was believed to have originated in sicily and whose oldest temple was there and king ferdinand of sicily ferdinandea however was not acceptable to other nations and was dropped ceres was called hera for a short time in germany in greece it is called demeter after the greek equivalent of the roman cers in english that name is used for the asteroid 1108 demeter the regular adjectival forms of the name are cererian and cererean derived from the latin genitive cereris but ceresian is occasionally seen for the goddess as in the sickle-shaped ceresian lake as is the shorter form cerean the old astronomical symbol of ceres is a sickle similar to venus symbol but with a break in the circle it has a variant reversed under the influence of the initial letter c of ceres these were later replaced with the generic asteroid symbol of a numbered disk cerium a rare-earth element discovered in 1803 was named after ceres in the same year another element was also initially named after ceres but when cerium was named its discoverer changed the name to palladium after the second asteroid 2 pallas classification the categorization of ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement johann elert bode believed ceres to be the missing planet he had proposed to exist between mars and jupiter at a distance of 419millionkm 28au from the sun ceres was assigned a planetary symbol and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables along with 2 pallas 3 juno and 4 vesta for half a century as other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of ceres it was realized that ceres represented the first of a new class of objects in 1802 with the discovery of 2 pallas william herschel coined the term asteroid star-like for these bodies writing that they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them even by very good telescopes as the first such body to be discovered ceres was given the designation 1 ceres under the modern system of minor-planet designations by the 1860s the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as ceres and the major planets was widely accepted though a precise definition of planet was never formulated the 2006 debate surrounding pluto and what constitutes a planet led to ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet a proposal before the international astronomical union for the definition of a planet would have defined a planet as a celestial body that a has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid-body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape and b is in orbit around a star and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet had this resolution been adopted it would have made ceres the fifth planet in order from the sun this never happened however and on 24 august 2006 a modified definition was adopted carrying the additional requirement that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit by this definition ceres is not a planet because it does not dominate its orbit sharing it as it does with the thousands of other asteroids in the asteroid belt and constituting only about a third of the mass of the belt bodies that met the first proposed definition but not the second such as ceres were instead classified as dwarf planets ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt it is sometimes assumed that ceres has been reclassified as a dwarf planet and that it is therefore no longer considered an asteroid for example a news update at spacecom spoke of pallas the largest asteroid and ceres the dwarf planet formerly classified as an asteroid whereas an iau question-and-answer posting states ceres is or now we can say it was the largest asteroid though it then speaks of other asteroids crossing ceres path and otherwise implies that ceres is still considered an asteroid the minor planet center notes that such bodies may have dual designations the 2006 iau decision that classified ceres as a dwarf planet never addressed whether it is or is not an asteroid indeed the iau has never defined the word asteroid at all having preferred the term minor planet until 2006 and preferring the terms small solar system body and dwarf planet after 2006 lang 2011 comments the iau has added a new designation to ceres classifying it as a dwarf planet by its definition eris haumea makemake and pluto as well as the largest asteroid 1 ceres are all dwarf planets and describes it elsewhere as the dwarf planetasteroid 1 ceres nasa continues to refer to ceres as an asteroid as do various academic textbooks orbit ceres follows an orbit between mars and jupiter within the asteroid belt with a period of 46 earth years the orbit is moderately inclined i 106 compared to 7 for mercury and 17 for pluto and moderately eccentric e 008 compared to 009 for mars the diagram illustrates the orbits of ceres blue and several planets white and gray the segments of orbits below the ecliptic are plotted in darker colors and the orange plus sign is the suns location the top left diagram is a polar view that shows the location of ceres in the gap between mars and jupiter the top right is a close-up demonstrating the locations of the perihelia q and aphelia q of ceres and mars in this diagram but not in general the perihelion of mars is on the opposite side of the sun from those of ceres and several of the large main-belt asteroids including 2 pallas and 10 hygiea the bottom diagram is a side view showing the inclination of the orbit of ceres compared to the orbits of mars and jupiter ceres was once thought to be a member of an asteroid family the asteroids of this family share similar proper orbital elements which may indicate a common origin through an asteroid collision some time in the past ceres was later found to have spectral properties different from other members of the family which is now called the gefion family after the next-lowest-numbered family member 1272 gefion ceres appears to be merely an interloper in the gefion family coincidentally having similar orbital elements but not a common origin resonances ceres is in a near-11 mean-motion orbital resonance with pallas their proper orbital periods differ by 02 however a true resonance between the two would be unlikely due to their small masses relative to their large separations such relationships among asteroids are very rare nevertheless ceres is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 11 resonant orbital relationships making them temporary trojans for periods up to 2 million years or more fifty such objects have been identified transits of planets from ceres mercury venus earth and mars can all appear to cross the sun or transit it from a vantage point on ceres the most common transits are those of mercury which usually happen every few years most recently in 2006 and 2010 the most recent transit of venus was in 1953 and the next will be in 2051 the corresponding dates are 1814 and 2081 for transits of earth and 767 and 2684 for transits of mars rotation and axial tilt the rotation period of ceres the cererian day is 9 hours and 4minutes it has an axial tilt of 4 this is small enough for ceress polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time similar to the situation on the moon and mercury about 014 of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps hopping an average of 3 times before escaping or being trapped geology ceres has a mass of 702093900000000000093910kg as determined from the dawn spacecraft with this mass ceres composes approximately a third of the estimated total 300210kg mass of the asteroid belt which is in turn approximately 4 of the mass of the moon ceres is massive enough to give it a nearly spherical equilibrium shape among solar system bodies ceres is intermediate in size between the smaller vesta and the larger tethys its surface area is approximately the same as the land area of india or argentina in july 2018 nasa released a comparison of physical features found on ceres with similar ones present on earth surface the surface composition of ceres is broadly similar to that of c-type asteroids some differences do exist the ubiquitous features in ceres ir spectrum are those of hydrated materials which indicate the presence of significant amounts of water in its interior other possible surface constituents include iron-rich clay minerals cronstedtite and carbonate minerals dolomite and siderite which are common minerals in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites the spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals are usually absent in the spectra of other c-type asteroids sometimes ceres is classified as a g-type asteroid ceres surface is relatively warm the maximum temperature with the sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be 235k approximately 38c 36f on 5 may 1991 ice is unstable at this temperature material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer solar system studies by the hubble space telescope reveal that graphite sulfur and sulfur dioxide are present on ceress surface the former is evidently the result of space weathering on ceress older surfaces the latter two are volatile under cererian conditions and would be expected to either escape quickly or settle in cold traps and are evidently associated with areas with recent geological activity observations prior to dawn prior to the dawn mission only a few surface features had been unambiguously detected on ceres high-resolution ultraviolet hubble space telescope images taken in 1995 showed a dark spot on its surface which was nicknamed piazzi in honor of the discoverer of ceres this was thought to be a crater later near-infrared images with a higher resolution taken over a whole rotation with the keck telescope using adaptive optics showed several bright and dark features moving with ceres rotation two dark features had circular shapes and were presumed to be craters one of them was observed to have a bright central region whereas another was identified as the piazzi feature visible-light hubble space telescope images of a full rotation taken in 2003 and 2004 showed eleven recognizable surface features the natures of which were then undetermined one of these features corresponds to the piazzi feature observed earlier these last observations indicated that the north pole of ceres pointed in the direction of right ascension 19h 24min 291 declination 59 in the constellation draco resulting in an axial tilt of approximately 3 dawn later determined that the north polar axis actually points at right ascension 19h 25m 403s 291418 declination 66 45 50 about 15 degrees from delta draconis which means an axial tilt of 4 observations by dawn dawn revealed that ceres has a heavily cratered surface nevertheless ceres does not have as many large craters as expected likely due to past geological processes an unexpectedly large number of cererian craters have central pits perhaps due to cryovolcanic processes and many have central peaks ceres has one prominent mountain ahuna mons this peak appears to be a cryovolcano and has few craters suggesting a maximum age of no more than a few hundred million years a later computer simulation has suggested that there were originally other cryovolcanoes on ceres that are now unrecognisable due to viscous relaxation several bright spots have been observed by dawn the brightest spot spot 5 located in the middle of an 80-kilometer 50mi crater called occator from images taken of ceres on 4 may 2015 the secondary bright spot was revealed to actually be a group of scattered bright areas possibly as many as ten these bright features have an albedo of approximately 40 that are caused by a substance on the surface possibly ice or salts reflecting sunlight a haze periodically appears above spot 5 the best known bright spot supporting the hypothesis that some sort of outgassing or sublimating ice formed the bright spots in march 2016 dawn found definitive evidence of water molecules on the surface of ceres at oxo crater on 9 december 2015 nasa scientists reported that the bright spots on ceres may be related to a type of salt particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite mgso46h2o the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays near-infrared spectra of these bright areas were reported in 2017 to be consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate na 2co 3 and smaller amounts of ammonium chloride nh 4cl or ammonium bicarbonate nh 4hco 3 these materials have been suggested to originate from the recent crystallization of brines that reached the surface from below carbon organic compounds tholins were detected on ceres in ernutet crater and most of the planets surface is extremely rich in carbon with approximately 20 carbon by mass in its near surface the carbon content is more than five times higher than in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites analyzed on earth the surface carbon shows evidence of being mixed with products of rock-water interactions such as clays this chemistry suggests ceres formed in a cold environment perhaps outside the orbit of jupiter and that it accreted from ultra-carbon-rich materials in the presence of water which could provide conditions favorable to organic chemistry its presence on ceres is evidence that the basic ingredients for life can be found throughout the universe internal structure ceres oblateness is consistent with a differentiated body a rocky core overlain with an icy mantle this 100-kilometer-thick mantle 2328 of ceres by mass 50 by volume contains up to 200million cubic kilometers of water which would be more than the amount of fresh water on earth this result is supported by the observations made by the keck telescope in 2002 and by evolutionary modeling also some characteristics of its surface and history such as its distance from the sun which weakened solar radiation enough to allow some fairly low-freezing-point components to be incorporated during its formation point to the presence of volatile materials in the interior of ceres it has been suggested that a remnant layer of liquid water may have survived to the present under a layer of ice shape and gravity field measurements by dawn confirm ceres is a body in hydrostatic equilibrium with partial differentiation and isostatic compensation with a mean moment of inertia of 037 which is similar to that of callisto at 036 the densities of the core and outer layer are estimated to be 246290 and 168195 gcm with the latter being about 70190km thick only partial dehydration of the core is expected the high density of the outer layer relative to water ice reflects its enrichment in silicates and salts ceres is the smallest object confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium being 600km smaller and less than half the mass of saturns moon rhea the next smallest such object modeling has suggested ceres could have a small metallic core from partial differentiation of its rocky fraction atmosphere there are indications that ceres has a tenuous water vapor atmosphere outgassing from water ice on the surface surface water ice is unstable at distances less than 5 au from the sun so it is expected to sublime if it is exposed directly to solar radiation water ice can migrate from the deep layers of ceres to the surface but escapes in a very short time as a result it is difficult to detect water vaporization water escaping from polar regions of ceres was possibly observed in the early 1990s but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated it may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the subsurface layers of ceres ultraviolet observations by the iue spacecraft detected statistically significant amounts of hydroxide ions near ceres north pole which is a product of water vapor dissociation by ultraviolet solar radiation in early 2014 using data from the herschel space observatory it was discovered that there are several localized not more than 60km in diameter mid-latitude sources of water vapor on ceres which each give off approximately 702610000000000000010 molecules or 3kg of water per second two potential source regions designated piazzi 123e 21n and region a 231e 23n have been visualized in the near infrared as dark areas region a also has a bright center by the w m keck observatory possible mechanisms for the vapor release are sublimation from approximately 06km of exposed surface ice or cryovolcanic eruptions resulting from radiogenic internal heat or from pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to growth of an overlying layer of ice surface sublimation would be expected to be lower when ceres is farther from the sun in its orbit whereas internally powered emissions should not be affected by its orbital position the limited data available was more consistent with cometary-style sublimation however subsequent evidence from dawn strongly suggests ongoing geologic activity could be at least partially responsible studies using dawns gamma ray and neutron detector grand reveal that ceres is accelerating electrons from the solar wind regularly although there are several possibilities as to what is causing this the most accepted is that these electrons are being accelerated by collisions between the solar wind and a tenuous water vapor exosphere in 2017 dawn confirmed that ceres has a transient atmosphere that appears to be linked to solar activity ice on ceres can sublimate when energetic particles from the sun hit exposed ice within craters origin and evolution ceres is possibly a surviving protoplanet planetary embryo which formed 457billion years ago in the asteroid belt although the majority of inner solar system protoplanets including all lunar- to mars-sized bodies either merged with other protoplanets to form terrestrial planets or were ejected from the solar system by jupiter ceres is thought to have survived relatively intact an alternative theory proposes that ceres formed in the kuiper belt and later migrated to the asteroid belt the discovery of ammonia salts in occator crater supports an origin in the outer solar system another possible protoplanet vesta is less than half the size of ceres it suffered a major impact after solidifying losing 1 of its mass the geological evolution of ceres was dependent on the heat sources available during and after its formation friction from planetesimal accretion and decay of various radionuclides possibly including short-lived extinct radionuclides such as aluminium-26 these are thought to have been sufficient to allow ceres to differentiate into a rocky core and icy mantle soon after its formation this process may have caused resurfacing by water volcanism and tectonics erasing older geological features ceress relatively warm surface temperature implies that any of the resulting ice on its surface would have gradually sublimated leaving behind various hydrated minerals like clay minerals and carbonates today ceres has become considerably less geologically active with a surface sculpted chiefly by impacts nevertheless evidence from dawn reveals that internal processes have continued to sculpt ceress surface to a significant extent in stark contrast to vesta and of previous expectations that ceres would have become geologically dead early in its history due to its small size the presence of significant amounts of water ice in its crust and evidence of recent geological resurfacing raises the possibility that ceres has a layer of liquid water in its interior this hypothetical layer is often called an ocean if such a layer of liquid water exists it is hypothesized to be located between the rocky core and ice mantle like that of the theorized ocean on europa the existence of an ocean is more likely if solutes ie salts ammonia sulfuric acid or other antifreeze compounds are dissolved in the water potential habitability although not as actively discussed as a potential home for microbial extraterrestrial life as mars europa enceladus or titan there is evidence that ceres icy mantle was once a watery subterranean ocean and that has led to speculations that life could have existed there and that hypothesized ejecta bearing microorganisms could have come from ceres to earth the remote detection of organic compounds and the presence of water with 20 carbon by mass in its near surface could provide conditions favorable to organic chemistry observation and exploration observation when in opposition near its perihelion ceres can reach an apparent magnitude of 67 this is generally regarded as too dim to be visible to the naked eye but under ideal viewing conditions keen eyes with 2020 vision may be able to see it the only other asteroids that can reach a similarly bright magnitude are 4 vesta and when in rare oppositions near their perihelions 2 pallas and 7 iris when in conjunction ceres has a magnitude of around 93 which corresponds to the faintest objects visible with 1050 binoculars thus it can be seen with such binoculars in a naturally dark and clear night sky around new moon some notable observations and milestones for ceres include the following 1984 november 13 an occultation of a star by ceres observed in mexico florida and across the caribbean 1995 june 25 ultraviolet hubble space telescope images with 50-kilometer resolution 2002 infrared images with 30-km resolution taken with the keck telescope using adaptive optics 2003 and 2004 visible light images with 30-km resolution the best prior to the dawn mission taken using hubble 2012 december 22 ceres occulted the star tyc 1865-00446-1 over parts of japan russia and china ceres brightness was magnitude 69 and the star 122 2014 ceres was found to have an atmosphere with water vapor confirmed by the herschel space telescope 2015 the nasa dawn spacecraft approached and orbited ceres sending detailed images and scientific data back to earth exploration in 1981 a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the european space agency esa named the asteroidal gravity optical and radar analysis agora this spacecraft was to launch some time in 19901994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids the preferred target for this mission was vesta agora would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past mars or by means of a small ion engine however the proposal was refused by esa a joint nasaesa asteroid mission was then drawn up for a multiple asteroid orbiter with solar electric propulsion maosep with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of vesta nasa indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission instead esa set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by france germany italy and the united states but none were approved exploration of ceres by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the second plan of the multiaimed soviet vesta mission developed in cooperation with european countries for realisation in 19911994 but canceled due to the soviet union disbanding in the early 1990s nasa initiated the discovery program which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions in 1996 the programs study team recommended as a high priority a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine funding for this program remained problematic for several years but by 2004 the dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review it was launched on 27 september 2007 as the space mission to make the first visits to both vesta and ceres on 3 may 2011 dawn acquired its first targeting image 12 million kilometers from vesta after orbiting vesta for 13 months dawn used its ion engine to depart for ceres with gravitational capture occurring on 6 march 2015 at a separation of 61000km four months prior to the new horizons flyby of pluto dawns mission profile called for it to study ceres from a series of circular polar orbits at successively lower altitudes it entered its first observational orbit rc3 around ceres at an altitude of 13500km on 23 april 2015 staying for only approximately one orbit fifteen days the spacecraft subsequently reduced its orbital distance to 4400km for its second observational orbit survey for three weeks then down to 1470km hamo high altitude mapping orbit for two months and then down to its final orbit at 375km lamo low altitude mapping orbit for at least three months the spacecraft instrumentation includes a framing camera a visual and infrared spectrometer and a gamma-ray and neutron detector these instruments examined ceres shape and elemental composition on 13 january 2015 dawn took the first images of ceres at near-hubble resolution revealing impact craters and a small high-albedo spot on the surface near the same location as that observed previously additional imaging sessions at increasingly better resolution took place on 25 january 4 12 19 and 25 february 1 march and 10 and 15 april dawns arrival in a stable orbit around ceres was delayed after close to reaching ceres it was hit by a cosmic ray making it take another longer route around ceres in back instead of a direct spiral towards it the chinese space agency is designing a sample-return mission from ceres that would take place during the 2020s maps map of quadrangles the following imagemap of the dwarf planet ceres is divided into 15 quadrangles they are named after the first craters whose names the
