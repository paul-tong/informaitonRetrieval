breakthrough initiatives is a science-based program founded in 2015 and funded by julia and yuri milner also of breakthrough prize to search for extraterrestrial intelligence over a span of at least 10 years the program is divided into multiple projects breakthrough listen will comprise an effort to search over 1000000 stars for artificial radio or laser signals a parallel project called breakthrough message is an effort to create a message representative of humanity and planet earth the project breakthrough starshot aims to send a swarm of probes to the nearest star at about 20 the speed of light the project breakthrough watch aims to identify and characterize earth-sized rocky planets around alpha centauri and other stars within 20 light years of earth breakthrough plans to send a mission to saturns moon enceladus in search for life in its warm ocean and in 2018 singed a partnership agreement with nasa for the project history the breakthrough initiatives were announced to the public on july 20 2015 at londons royal society by physicist stephen hawking russian tycoon yuri milner created the initiatives to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life in the universe and consider a plan for possibly transmitting messages out into space the announcement included an open letter co-signed by multiple scientists including hawking expressing support for an intensified search for alien radio communications during the public launch hawking said in an infinite universe there must be other life there is no bigger question it is time to commit to finding the answer the us100 million cash infusion is projected to mark up the pace of seti research over the early 2000s rate and will nearly double the rate nasa was spending on seti research annually in approximately 19731993 projects breakthrough listen breakthrough listen is a program to search for intelligent extraterrestrial communications in the universe with 100 million in funding and thousands of hours of dedicated telescope time on state-of-the-art facilities it is the most comprehensive search for alien communications to date the project began in january 2016 and is expected to continue for 10 years the project uses radio wave observations from the green bank observatory and the parkes observatory and visible light observations from the automated planet finder targets for the project include one million nearby stars and the centers of 100 galaxies all data generated from the project are available to the public and setihome is used for some of the data analysis the first results were published in april 2017 with further updates expected every 6 months breakthrough message the breakthrough message program is to study the ethics of sending messages into deep space it also launched an open competition with a us1 million prize pool to design a digital message that could be transmitted from earth to an extraterrestrial civilization the message should be representative of humanity and planet earth the program pledges not to transmit any message until there has been a global debate at high levels of science and politics on the risks and rewards of contacting advanced civilizations breakthrough starshot breakthrough starshot announced april 12 2016 is a us 100 million program to develop a proof-of-concept light sail spacecraft fleet capable of making the journey to alpha centauri at 20 the speed of light 60000kms or 215 million kmh taking about 20 years to get there and about 4 years to notify earth of a successful arrival the interstellar journey may include a flyby of proxima centauri b an earth-sized exoplanet that is in the habitable zone of its host star in the alpha centauri system from a distance of 1 astronomical unit 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles the four cameras on each of the spacecraft could potentially capture an image of high enough quality to resolve surface features the spacecraft fleet would have 1000 craft and each craft named starchip would be a very small centimeter-sized craft weighing several grams they would be propelled by several ground-based lasers of up to 100 gigawatts each tiny spacecraft would transmit data back to earth using a compact on-board laser communications system pete worden is the head of this project the conceptual principles to enable this interstellar travel project were described in a roadmap to interstellar flight by philip lubin of uc santa barbara meti president douglas vakoch summarized the significance of the project saying that by sending hundreds or thousands of space probes the size of postage stampsbreakthrough starshotgets around the hazards of spaceflight that could easily end a mission relying on a single spacecraft only one nanocraft needs to make its way toalpha centauriand send back a signal for the mission to be successful when that happens starshot will make history in july 2017 scientists announced that precursors to starchip named sprites were successfully launched and flown breakthrough watch breakthrough watchis a multimillion-dollar astronomical program to develop earth- and space-based technologies that can find earth-like planets in our cosmic neighborhood and try to establish whether they host life the project aims to identify and characterize earth-sized rocky planets around alpha centauri and other stars within 20 light years of earth in search of oxygen and other biosignatures breakthrough enceladus breakthrough enceladus is an astrobiology space probe mission concept to explore the possibility of life on saturns moon enceladus in september 2018 nasa signed a collaboration agreement with breakthrough to jointly create the mission concept this mission if launched would be the first privately funded deep space mission it would study the content of the plumes ejecting from enceladuss warm ocean through its southern ice crust enceladuss ice crust is thought to be around two to five kilometers thick and a probe could use an ice-penetrating radar to constrain its structure see also active seti colossus array array of 74m telescopes capable of laser propelling nano crafts communication with
