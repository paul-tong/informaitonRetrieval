white blood cells also called leukocytes or leucocytes and abbreviated as wbcs are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders all white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells leukocytes are found throughout the body including the blood and lymphatic system all white blood cells have nuclei which distinguishes them from the other blood cells the anucleated red blood cells rbcs and platelets types of white blood cells can be classified in standard ways two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure granulocytes or agranulocytes or by cell lineage myeloid cells or lymphoid cells these broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types neutrophils eosinophils acidophiles basophils lymphocytes and monocytes these types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic further subtypes can be classified for example among lymphocytes there are b cells t cells and nk cells the number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease and thus the white blood cell count is an important subset of the complete blood count the normal white cell count is usually between 4 10l and 11 10l in the us this is usually expressed as 4000 to 11000 white blood cells per microliter of blood white blood cells make up approximately 1 of the total blood volume in a healthy adult making them substantially less numerous than the red blood cells at 40 to 45 however this 1 of the blood makes a large difference to health because immunity depends on it an increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis it is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses which happen frequently it is occasionally abnormal when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin a decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia this indicates a weakened immune system etymology the name white blood cell derives from the physical appearance of a blood sample after centrifugation white cells are found in the buffy coat a thin typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented red blood cells and the blood plasma the scientific term leukocyte directly reflects its description it is derived from the greek roots leuk- meaning white and cyt- meaning cell the buffy coat may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of neutrophils in the sample due to the heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase that they produce types overview all white blood cells are nucleated which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets types of leukocytes can be classified in standard ways two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure granulocytes or agranulocytes or by cell lineage myeloid cells or lymphoid cells these broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types neutrophils eosinophils basophils lymphocytes and monocytes these types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic further subtypes can be classified granulocytes are distinguished from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape lobed versus round that is polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear and by their cytoplasm granules present or absent or more precisely visible on light microscopy or not thus visible the other dichotomy is by lineage myeloid cells neutrophils monocytes eosinophils and basophils are distinguished from lymphoid cells lymphocytes by hematopoietic lineage cellular differentiation lineage lymphocytes can be further classified as t cells b cells and natural killer cells neutrophil neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell constituting 60-70 of the circulating leukocytes and including two functionally unequal subpopulations neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers they defend against bacterial or fungal infection they are usually first responders to microbial infection their activity and death in large numbers form pus they are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear pmn leukocytes although in the technical sense pmn refers to all granulocytes they have a multi-lobed nucleus which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands this gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte the cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds these cells are not able to renew their lysosomes used in digesting microbes and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation the life span of a circulating human neutrophil is about 54 days eosinophil eosinophils compose about 2-4 of the wbc total this count fluctuates throughout the day seasonally and during menstruation it rises in response to allergies parasitic infections collagen diseases and disease of the spleen and central nervous system they are rare in the blood but numerous in the mucous membranes of the respiratory digestive and lower urinary tracts they primarily deal with parasitic infections eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions the most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma hay fever and hives and also parasitic infections they secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites such as hook worms and tapeworms that are too big for any one wbc to phagocytize in general their nucleus is bi-lobed the lobes are connected by a thin strand the cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining basophil basophils are chiefly responsible for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels because they are the rarest of the white blood cells less than 05 of the total count and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells they are difficult to study they can be recognized by several coarse dark violet granules giving them a blue hue the nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it they excrete two chemicals that aid in the bodys defenses histamine and heparin histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue it also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site lymphocyte lymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system than in blood lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm lymphocytes include b cells make antibodies that can bind to pathogens block pathogen invasion activate the complement system and enhance pathogen destruction t cells cd4 helper t cells t cells displaying co-receptor cd4 are known as cd4 t cells these cells have t-cell receptors and cd4 molecules that in combination bind antigenic peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecules on antigen-presenting cells helper t cells make cytokines and perform other functions that help coordinate the immune response in hiv infection these t cells are the main index to identify the individuals immune system integrity cd8 cytotoxic t cells t cells displaying co-receptor cd8 are known as cd8 t cells these cells bind antigens presented on mhc i complex of virus-infected or tumour cells and kill them nearly all nucleated cells display mhc i t cells possess an alternative t cell receptor different from the tcr found on conventional cd4 and cd8 t cells found in tissue more commonly than in blood t cells share characteristics of helper t cells cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells cd4 helper t cells t cells displaying co-receptor cd4 are known as cd4 t cells these cells have t-cell receptors and cd4 molecules that in combination bind antigenic peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecules on antigen-presenting cells helper t cells make cytokines and perform other functions that help coordinate the immune response in hiv infection these t cells are the main index to identify the individuals immune system integrity cd8 cytotoxic t cells t cells displaying co-receptor cd8 are known as cd8 t cells these cells bind antigens presented on

and cd8 t cells found in tissue more commonly than in blood t cells share characteristics of helper t cells cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells natural killer cells are able to kill cells of the body that do not display mhc class i molecules or display stress markers such as mhc class i polypeptide-related sequence a mic-a decreased expression of mhc class i and up-regulation of mic-a can happen when cells are infected by a virus or become cancerous monocyte monocytes the largest type of wbcs share the vacuum cleaner phagocytosis function of neutrophils but are much longer lived as they have an extra role they present pieces of pathogens to t cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed this causes an antibody response to be mounted monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream and become tissue macrophages which remove dead cell debris as well as attack microorganisms neither dead cell debris nor attacking microorganisms can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils unlike neutrophils monocytes are able to replace their lysosomal contents and are thought to have a much longer active life they have the kidney shaped nucleus and are typically agranulated they also possess abundant cytoplasm fixed leucocytes some leucocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in such as fixed macrophages in the liver which become known as kupffer cells these cells still serve a role in the immune system histiocytes dendritic cells although these will often migrate to local lymph nodes upon ingesting antigens mast cells microglia disorders the two commonly used categories of white blood cell disorders divide them quantitatively into those causing excessive numbers proliferative disorders and those causing insufficient numbers leukopenias leukocytosis is usually healthy eg fighting an infection but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative wbc proliferative disorders can be classed as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative some are autoimmune but many are neoplastic another way to categorize disorders of white blood cells is qualitatively there are various disorders in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally neoplasia of wbcs can be benign but is often malignant of the various tumors of the blood and lymph cancers of wbcs can be broadly classified as leukemias and lymphomas although those categories overlap and are often grouped as a pair leucopenias a range of disorders can cause decreases in white blood cells this type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil in this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia less commonly a decrease in lymphocytes called lymphocytopenia or lymphopenia may be seen neutropenia neutropenia can be acquired or intrinsic a decrease in levels of neutrophils on lab tests is due to either decreased production of neutrophils or increased removal from the blood the following list of causes is not complete medications - chemotherapy sulfas or other antibiotics phenothiazenes benzodiazepines antithyroids anticonvulsants quinine quinidine indomethacin procainamide thiazides radiation toxins - alcohol benzenes intrinsic disorders - fanconis kostmanns cyclic neutropenia chdiakhigashi immune dysfunction - disorders of collagen aids rheumatoid arthritis blood cell dysfunction - megaloblastic anemia myelodysplasia marrow failure marrow replacement acute leukemia any major infection miscellaneous - starvation hypersplenism symptoms of neutropenia are associated with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils for example the most common cause of acquired neutropenia is drug-induced so an individual may have symptoms of medication overdose or toxicity treatment is also aimed at the underlying cause of the neutropenia one severe consequence of neutropenia is that it can increase the risk of infection lymphocytopenia defined as total lymphocyte count below 10x10l the cells most commonly affected are cd4 t cells like neutropenia lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic and there are many causes this is not a complete list inherited immune deficiency - severe combined immunodeficiency common variable immune deficiency ataxia-telangiectasia wiskott-aldrich syndrome immunodeficiency with short-limbed dwarfism immunodeficiency with thymoma purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency genetic

deficiency like neutropenia symptoms and treatment of lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts proliferative disorders an increase in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis this increase is most commonly caused by inflammation there are four major causes increase of production in bone marrow increased release from storage in bone marrow decreased attachment to veins and arteries decreased uptake by tissues leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic eosinophilic basophilic monocytosis or lymphocytosis neutrophilia neutrophilia is an increase in the absolute neutrophil count in the peripheral circulation normal blood values vary by age neutrophilia can be caused by a direct problem with blood cells primary disease it can also occur as a consequence of an underlying disease secondary most cases of neutrophilia are secondary to inflammation primary causes conditions with normally functioning neutrophils hereditary neutrophilia chronic idiopathic neutrophilia pelgerhuet anomaly down syndrome leukocyte adhesion deficiency familial cold urticaria leukemia chronic myelogenous cml and other myeloproliferative disorders surgical removal of spleen secondary causes infection chronic inflammation especially juvenile rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis stills disease crohns disease ulcerative colitis granulomatous infections for example tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis cigarette smoking occurs in 2550 of chronic smokers and can last up to 5 years after quitting stress exercise surgery general stress medication induced corticosteroids for example prednisone -agonists lithium cancer either by growth factors secreted by the tumor or invasion of bone marrow by the cancer increased destruction of cells in peripheral circulation can stimulate bone marrow this can occur in hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura eosinophilia a normal eosinophil count is considered to be less than 06510l eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age time lower in the morning and higher at night exercise environment and exposure to allergens eosinophilia is never a normal lab finding efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause though the cause may not always be found counting and reference ranges the complete blood cell count is a blood panel that includes the overall wbc count and various subsets such as the absolute neutrophil count reference ranges for blood tests specify the typical counts in healthy people tlc-
