a rover or sometimes planetary rover is a space exploration vehicle designed to move across the surface of a planet or other celestial body some rovers have been designed to transport members of a human spaceflight crew others have been partially or fully autonomous robots rovers usually arrive at the planetary surface on a lander-style spacecraft rovers are created to land on another planet besides earth to find out information and to take samples they can collect dust rocks and even take pictures they are very useful for exploring the universe comparison with space probes of other types rovers have several advantages over stationary landers they examine more territory and they can be directed to interesting features if they are solar powered they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months they can also advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control which is necessarily semi-autonomous due to the finite speed of light their advantages over orbiting spacecraft are that they can make observations to a microscopic level and can conduct physical experimentation disadvantages of rovers compared to orbiters are the higher chance of failure due to landing and other risks and that they are limited to a small area around a landing site which itself is only approximately anticipated features rovers arrive on spacecraft and are used in conditions very distinct from those on the earth which makes some demands on their design reliability rovers have to withstand high levels of acceleration high and low temperatures pressure dust corrosion cosmic rays remaining functional without repair for a needed period of time compactness rovers are usually packed for placing in a spacecraft because it has limited capacity and has to be deployed they are also attached to a spacecraft so devices for removing these connections are installed autonomy rovers which land on celestial bodies far from the earth such as the mars exploration rovers cannot be remotely controlled in real-time since the speed at which radio signals travel is far too slow for real time or near-real time communication for example sending a signal from mars to earth takes between 3 and 21 minutes these rovers are thus capable of operating autonomously with little assistance from ground control as far as navigation and data acquisition are concerned although they still require human input for identifying promising targets in the distance to which to drive and determining how to position itself to maximize solar energy giving a rover some rudimentary visual identification capabilities to make simple distinctions can allow engineers to speed up the reconnaissance during the nasa sample return robot centennial challenge a rover named cataglyphis successfully demonstrated autonomous navigation decision-making and sample detection retrieval and return capabilities non-wheeled approaches other rover designs that do not use wheeled approaches are possible mechanisms that utilize walking on robotic legs hopping rolling etc are possible for example stanford university researchers have proposed hedgehog a small cube-shaped rover that can controllably hopor even spin out of a sandy sinkhole by corkscrewing upward to escapefor surface exploration of low gravity celestial bodies history lunokhod 0 no201 the soviet rover was intended to be the first roving remote-controlled robot on the moon but crashed during a failed start of the launcher 19 february 1969 lunokhod 1 the lunokhod 1 rover landed on the moon in november 1970 it was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on any celestial body the soviet union launched lunokhod 1 aboard the luna 17 spacecraft on november 10 1970 and it entered lunar orbit on november 15 the spacecraft soft-landed in the sea of rains region on november 17 the lander had dual ramps from which lunokhod 1 could descend to the lunar surface which it did at 0628 ut from november 17 1970 to november 22 1970 the rover drove 197 m and during 10 communication sessions returned 14 close up pictures of the moon and 12 panoramic views it also analyzed the lunar soil the last successful communications session with lunokhod 1 was on september 14 1971 having worked for 11 months lunokhod 1 held the durability record for space rovers for more than 30 years until a new record was set by the mars exploration rovers apollo lunar roving vehicle nasa included lunar roving vehicles in three apollo missions apollo 15 which landed on the moon july 30 1971 apollo 16 which landed april 21 1972 and apollo 17 which landed december 11 1972 lunokhod 2 the lunokhod 2 was the second of two unmanned lunar rovers landed on the moon by the soviet union as part of the lunokhod program the rover became operational on the moon on january 16 1973 it was the second roving remote-controlled robot to land on any celestial body the soviet union launched lunokhod 2 aboard the luna 21 spacecraft on january 8 1973 and the spacecraft soft-landed in the eastern edge of the mare serenitatis region on january 15 1973 lunokhod 2 descended from the landers dual ramps to the lunar surface at 0114 ut on january 16 1973 lunokhod 2 operated for about four months covered 39km 24mi of terrain including hilly upland areas and rilles and sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80000 tv pictures based on wheel rotations lunokhod 2 was thought to have covered 37km 23mi but russian scientists at the moscow state university of geodesy and cartography miigaik have revised that to an estimated distance of about 421422km 262262mi based on lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro images of the lunar surface subsequent discussions with their american counterparts ended with an agreed-upon final distance of 39km 24mi which has stuck since prop-m the soviet mars 2 and mars 3 landers each had a small 45kg mars rover on board which would have moved across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a 15-meter umbilical two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance as radio signals from earth would have taken too long to drive the rovers using remote control the rover was planned to be placed on the surface after landing by a manipulator arm and to move in the field of view of the television cameras and stop to make measurements every 15 meters the rover tracks in the martian soil would also have been recorded to determine material properties because of the crash landing of mars 2 and the communication failure 15 seconds post landing of mars 3 neither rover was deployed lunokhod 3 the soviet rover was intended to be the third roving remote-controlled robot on the moon in 1977 the mission was canceled due to lack of launcher availability and funding although the rover was built marsokhod the marsokhod was a heavy soviet rover hybrid with both controls telecommand and automatic aimed at mars part of the mars 4nm and scheduled to be released after 1973 according to the plans of 1970 launched by a n1 rocket that never arrived to fly successfully sojourner the mars pathfinder mission included sojourner the first rover to successfully deploy on another planet nasa the space agency of the united states launched mars pathfinder on 4 december 1996 it landed on mars in a region called chryse planitia on 4 july 1997 from its landing until the final data transmission on 27 september 1997 mars pathfinder returned 16500 images from the lander and 550 images from sojourner as well as data from more than 15 chemical analyses of rocks and soil and extensive data on winds and other weather factors beagle 2 planetary undersurface tool beagle 2 was designed to explore mars with a small mole planetary undersurface tool or pluto to be deployed by the arm pluto had a compressed spring mechanism designed to enable it to move across the surface at a rate of 20mm per second and to burrow into the ground and collect a subsurface sample in a cavity in its tip beagle 2 failed while attempting to land on mars in 2003 mars exploration rover spirit spirit is a robotic rover on mars active from 2004 to 2010 it was one of two rovers of nasas ongoing mars exploration rover mission it landed successfully on mars at 0435 ground utc on january 4 2004 three weeks before its twin opportunity mer-b landed on the other side of the planet its name was chosen through a nasa-sponsored student essay competition the rover became stuck in late 2009 and its last communication with earth was sent on march 22 2010 change 3s yutu rover change 3 is a chinese moon mission that includes a robotic lunar rover yutu named after the pet rabbit of change the goddess of the moon in chinese mythology launched in 2013 with the change 3 mission it is chinas first lunar rover the first soft landing on the moon since 1976 and the first rover to operate there since the soviet lunokhod 2 ceased operations on 11 may 1973 it was deployed on the moon on december 14 2013 and the rover encountered operational difficulties toward the end of the second lunar day after surviving and recovering successfully the first 14-day lunar night about a month on the moon and was unable to move after the end of the second lunar night though it continued to gather useful information for some months afterward in october 2015 yutu set the record for the longest operational period for a rover on the moon on 31 july 2016 yutu ceased to operate after a total of 31 months well beyond its original expected lifespan of three months mars exploration rover opportunity opportunity is a robotic rover on the planet mars active from 2004 to 2018 launched from earth on july 7 2003 it landed on the martian meridiani planum on january 25 2004 at 0505 ground utc about 1315 local time three weeks after its twin spirit mer-a touched down on the other side of the planet on july 28 2014 nasa announced that opportunity after having traveled over 40km 25mi on the planet mars has set a new off-world record as the rover having driven the greatest distance surpassing the previous record held by the soviet unions lunokhod 2 rover that had traveled 39km 24mi related image active rover missions active rover locations in context mars science laboratory rover curiosity on 26 november 2011 nasas mars science laboratory mission was successfully
