aristotle rsttlgreek aristotlspronounced aristotls 384322bc was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidiki greece along with plato he is considered the father of western philosophy aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him including those of socrates and plato and it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry as a result his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion little is known about his life his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven c 347 bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics economics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in 343 bc teaching alexander gave aristotle many opportunities he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books which were papyrus scrolls the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following platos death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception aristotles views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotles views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotles zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the 19th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotelianism profoundly influenced islamic thought during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotles philosophy continue to be the object of academic study though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle has been depicted by major artists including raphael and rembrandt early modern theories including william harveys circulation of the blood and galileo galileis kinematics were developed in reaction to aristotles in the 19th century george boole gave aristotles logic a mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic in the 20th century martin heidegger created a new interpretation of aristotles political philosophy but elsewhere aristotle was widely criticised even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher bertrand russell and the biologist peter medawar more recently aristotle has again been taken seriously such as in the thinking of ayn rand and alasdair macintyre while armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology the image of aristotle tutoring the young alexander remains current and the poetics continues to play a role in the cinema of the united states life in general the details of aristotles life are not well-established the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in 384bc in stagira chalcidice about 55km 34 miles east of modern-day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotles childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in 34847bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti-macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias in 343 bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotles time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by 335bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an ermenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between 335 and 323 bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexanders death anti-macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in 322bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athenss trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife abstract philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around 40 bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics epistemology like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the universal aristotles ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate this means that aristotles epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics 1025b25 his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics metaphysics the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretik philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics 1026a16 if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge but if there is some motionless independent thing the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy and it is universal in just this way because it is first and it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti n einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b320a he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which to hou heneka a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance ie matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same universals and particulars plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyse a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms a place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms natural philosophy aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences physics five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets motion aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics 254b10 and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens 300a20 in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens while the 4 empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places in the physics 215a25 aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional say with constant c to its weight w and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in the middle ages and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting eg the ball leaves the throwers hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of a table is wood it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form ie the arrangement of that matter it tells us what a thing is that a thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole ie macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole-part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create a drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs in the case of two dominoes when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over in the case of animals this agency is a combination of how it develops from the egg and how its body functions the final cause telos is its purpose the reason why a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition in the case of living things it implies adaptation to a particular way of life optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems book 15 the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the suns image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to peoples moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them geology aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption biology empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the 19th century he gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has a long neck and long legs and a sharp spear-like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridisations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds a fertilised hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside instead he practised a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotles biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than a mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice classification of living things aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral-like eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals see also he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the live-bearing mammals and the egg-laying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea non-shelled cephalopods and shelled and the hard-shelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design psychology soul aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psychs posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture phantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian common sense and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then look away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric just war theory aristotelian just war theory is not well regarded in the present day especially his view that warfare was justified to ensalve natural slaves in aristotelian philosophy the abolition of what he considers natural slavery would undermine civic freedom the pusuit of freedom is inseperable from pursuing mastery over those who deserve to be slaves according to the cambridge companion to aristotles politics the targets of this aggresive warfare were non-greeks noting aristotles view that our poets say it is proper for greeks to rule non-greeks aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war extolling it as a chance for virtue and writing that the leisure that accompanies peace tends to make people arrogant war to avoid becoming enslaved to others is justified as self-defense he writes that war compels people to be just and temperate however in order to be just war must be chosen for the sake of peace with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character thik aret often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and also arguing that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koinnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule ie the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is a kind of intelligence ie a discourse based on intelligence and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions a just man choosing to live justly a man with bravery to live bravely likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity hence its evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods economics aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbinss view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it rhetoric and poetics aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speakers character pathos an appeal to the audiences emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorises rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot-structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men influence more than 2300 years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought on his successor theophrastus aristotles pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants a pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned on later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotles notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property on hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena on the medieval islamic world aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy on medieval europe with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad 600 to c 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that a womans charms could overcome even the greatest philosophers male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy on early modern scientists in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight on 19th-century thinkers the 19th-century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book the laws of thought this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two modern rejection and rehabilitation during the 20th century aristotles work was widely criticised the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell called aristotles ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses in 1985 the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility by the start of the 21st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best 20th-century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the 2004 film alexander while the firm rules of aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood biologists continue to be interested in aristotles thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology while niko tinbergens four questions based on aristotles four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny surviving works corpus aristotelicum the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotles lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school reference to them is made according to the organisation of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin 18311870 which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum schoolcite error there are ref tags on this page without content in them see the help page aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterisation from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication ciceros description of aristotles literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones we now possess came to us the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy depictions aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries among the best-known is raphaels fresco the school of athens in the vaticans apostolic palace where the figures

philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones writes this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world ensnaring us in its musty
