the zenith is an imaginary point directly above a particular location on the imaginary celestial sphere above means in the vertical direction opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location the opposite direction ie the direction in which gravity pulls is toward the nadir the zenith is the highest point on the celestial sphere origin the word zenith derives from an inaccurate reading of the arabic expression samt ar-ras meaning direction of the head or path above the head by medieval latin scribes in the middle ages during the 14th century possibly through old spanish it was reduced to samt direction and miswritten as senitcenit the m being misread as ni through the old french cenith zenith first appeared in the 17th century relevance and use the term zenith is sometimes used to refer to the highest point way or level reached by a celestial body on its daily apparent path around a given point of observation this sense of the word is often used to describe the position of the sun the sun reached its zenith but to an astronomer the sun does not have its own zenith and is at the zenith only if it is directly overhead in a scientific context the zenith is the direction of reference for measuring the zenith angle the angle between a direction of interest eg a star and the local zenith the sun reaches the observers zenith when it is 90 above the horizon and this only happens between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn at a given location during the course of a day the sun reaches not only its zenith but also its nadir at the antipode of that location 12 hours from solar noon in astronomy the altitude in the horizontal coordinate system and the zenith angle are complementary angles with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith the astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith and is defined as a circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith nadir and the celestial poles a zenith telescope is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith and used for precision measurement of star positions to simplify telescope construction or both the nasa orbital debris observatory and the large zenith telescope are both zenith telescopes since the use of liquid mirrors meant these telescopes could only point straight up on the international space station zenith and nadir are used instead of up and down referring to directions within and around the station relative to the earth see also azimuth geodesy history of geodesy keyhole problem midheaven subsolar point vertical deflection horizontal coordinate system glickman todd s 2000 glossary of meteorology american meteorological society isbn978-1-878220-34-9 mcintosh d h 1972 meteorological glossary 5th ed isbn978-0-8206-0228-8 jacqueline picochefr 2002 dictionnaire tymologique du franais paris le robert isbn978-2-85036-458-7cs1 maint multiple names authors list link
