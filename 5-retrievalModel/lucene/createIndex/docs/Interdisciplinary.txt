interdisciplinarity or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity eg a research project it draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology anthropology psychology economics etc it is about creating something by thinking across boundaries it is related to an interdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought as new needs and professions emerge large engineering teams are usually interdisciplinary as a power station or mobile phone or other project requires the melding of several specialties however the term interdisciplinary is sometimes confined to academic settings the term interdisciplinary is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study interdisciplinarity involves researchers students and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought professions or technologiesalong with their specific perspectivesin the pursuit of a common task the epidemiology of hivaids or global warming requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems interdisciplinary may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions for example womens studies or ethnic area studies interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields the adjective interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines for example the subject of land use may appear differently when examined by different disciplines for instance biology chemistry economics geography and politics development although interdisciplinary and interdisciplinarity are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms the concept has historical antecedents most notably greek philosophy julie thompson klein attests that the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discoursethe ideas of a unified science general knowledge synthesis and the integration of knowledge while giles gunn says that greek historians and dramatists took elements from other realms of knowledge such as medicine or philosophy to further understand their own material the building of roman roads required men who understood surveying material science logistics and several other disciplines any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity and history shows a crowd of cases as seventeenth-century leibnizs task to create a system of universal justice which required linguistics economics management ethics law philosophy politics and even sinology interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem for example social science disciplines such as anthropology and sociology paid little attention to the social analysis of technology throughout most of the twentieth century as a result many social scientists with interests in technology have joined science technology and society programs which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines they may also arise from new research developments such as nanotechnology which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines examples include quantum information processing an amalgamation of quantum physics and computer science and bioinformatics combining molecular biology with computer science sustainable development as a research area deals with problems requiring analysis and synthesis across economic social and environmental spheres often an integration of multiple social and natural science disciplines interdisciplinary research is also key to the study of health sciences for example in studying optimal solutions to diseases some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in interdisciplinary studies at another level interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization and isolation in information silos on some views however interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of studythat is without specialists interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically when interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems much information is given back to the various disciplines involved therefore both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another barriers because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines they must learn to appreciate differing of perspectives and methods for example a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative rigor may produce practitioners who think of themselves and their discipline as more scientific than others in turn colleagues in softer disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem an interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines and in disciplinary attitudes on the other hand and from the disciplinary perspective much interdisciplinary work may be seen as soft lacking in rigor or ideologically motivated these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work for example interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by peer reviewers drawn from established disciplines not surprisingly interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research in addition untenured researchers know that when they seek promotion and tenure it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity they may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy for example interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a joint appointment with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program such as womens studies and a traditional discipline such as history if the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals leading to the perception if not the fact that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish in addition since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teachers salary and time during periods of budgetary contraction the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency ie students majoring in the traditional discipline makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood for these same reasons the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often resisted because it is perceived as a competition for diminishing funds due to these and other barriers interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves if they succeed they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions in so doing they lower the risk of entry examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines many of them named for their parent disciplines include neuroscience cybernetics biochemistry and biomedical engineering these new fields are occasionally referred to as interdisciplines on the other hand even though interdisciplinary activities are now a focus of attention for institutions promoting learning and teaching as well as organizational and social entities concerned with education they are practically facing complex barriers serious challenges and criticism the most important obstacles and challenges faced by interdisciplinary activities in the past two decades can be divided into professional organizational and cultural obstacles interdisciplinary studies and studies of interdisciplinarity an initial distinction should be made between interdisciplinary studies which can be found spread across the academy today and the study of interdisciplinarity which involves a much smaller group of researchers the former is instantiated in thousands of research centers across the us and the world the latter has one us organization the association for interdisciplinary studies founded in 1979 two international organizations the international network of inter- and transdisciplinarity founded in 2010 and the philosophy ofas interdisciplinarity network founded in 2009 and one research institute devoted to the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity the center for the study of interdisciplinarity at the university of north texas founded in 2008 as of september 1 2014 the center for the study of interdisciplinarity has ceased to exist this is the result of administrative decisions at the university of north texas an interdisciplinary study is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad perspectives knowledge skills interconnections and epistemology in an educational setting interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective for example womens studies or medieval studies more rarely and at a more advanced level interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study in a critique of institutionalized disciplines ways of segmenting knowledge in contrast studies of interdisciplinarity raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works the nature and history of disciplinarity and the future of knowledge in post-industrial society researchers at the center for the study of interdisciplinarity have made the distinction between philosophy of and as interdisciplinarity the former identifying a new discrete area within philosophy that raises epistemological and metaphysical questions about the status of interdisciplinary thinking with the latter pointing toward a philosophical practice that is sometimes called field philosophy perhaps the most common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs by supporters and detractors alike is the lack of synthesisthat is students are provided with multiple disciplinary perspectives but are not given effective guidance in resolving the conflicts and achieving a coherent view of the subject others have argued that the very idea of synthesis or integration of disciplines presupposes questionable politico-epistemic commitments critics of interdisciplinary programs feel that the ambition is simply unrealistic given the knowledge and intellectual maturity of all but the exceptional undergraduate some defenders concede the difficulty but insist that cultivating interdisciplinarity as a habit of mind even at that level is both possible and essential to the education of informed and engaged citizens and leaders capable of analyzing evaluating and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to render reasoned decisions while much has been written on the philosophy and promise of interdisciplinarity in academic programs and professional practice social scientists are increasingly interrogating academic discourses on interdisciplinarity as well as how interdisciplinarity actually worksand does notin practice some have shown for example that some interdisciplinary enterprises that aim to serve society can produce deleterious outcomes for which no one can be held to account politics of interdisciplinary studies since 1998 there has been an ascendancy in the value of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelors degrees awarded at us universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies the number of interdisciplinary bachelors degrees awarded annually rose from 7000 in 1973 to 30000 a year by 2005 according to data from the national center of educational statistics necs in addition educational leaders from the boyer commission to carnegies president vartan gregorian to alan i leshner ceo of the american association for the advancement of science have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st century this has been echoed by federal funding agencies particularly the national institutes of health under the direction of elias zerhouni who has advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher single discipline ones at the same time many thriving longstanding bachelors in interdisciplinary studies programs in existence for 30 or more years have been closed down in spite of healthy enrollment examples include arizona international formerly part of the university of arizona the school of interdisciplinary studies at miami university and the department of interdisciplinary studies at wayne state university others such as the department of interdisciplinary studies at appalachian state university and george mason universitys new century college have been cut back stuart henry has seen this trend as part of the hegemony of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry this is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia historical examples there are many examples of when a particular idea almost on the same period arises in different disciplines one case is the shift from the approach of focusing on specialized segments of attention adopting one particular perspective to the idea of instant sensory awareness of the whole an attention to the total field a sense of the whole pattern of form and function as a unity an integral idea of structure and configuration this has happened in painting with cubism physics poetry communication and educational theory according to marshall mcluhan this paradigm shift was due to the passage from an era shaped by mechanization which brought sequentiality to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity which brought simultaneity efforts to simplify and defend the concept an article in the social science journal attempts to provide a simple common-sense definition of interdisciplinarity bypassing the difficulties of defining that concept and obviating the need for such related concepts as transdisciplinarity pluridisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity to begin with a discipline can be conveniently defined as any comparatively self-contained and isolated domain of human experience which possesses its own community of experts interdisciplinarity is best seen as bringing together distinctive components of two or more disciplines in academic discourse interdisciplinarity typically applies to four realms knowledge research education and theory interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity with components of two or more disciplines interdisciplinary research combines components of two or more disciplines in the search or creation of new knowledge operations or artistic expressions interdisciplinary education merges components of two or more disciplines in a single program of instruction interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge research or education as its main objects of study in turn interdisciplinary richness of any two instances of knowledge research or education can be ranked by weighing four variables number of disciplines involved the distance between them the novelty of any particular combination and their extent of integration interdisciplinary knowledge and research are important because creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge immigrants often make important contributions to their new field disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines many intellectual social and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research more so than narrow disciplinarians interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice by bridging fragmented disciplines interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom quotations the modern mind divides specializes thinks in categories the greek instinct was the opposite to take the widest view to see things as an organic whole it was arete that the olympic games were designed to test the arete of the whole man not a merely specialized skill the great event was the pentathlon if you won this you were a man needless to say the marathon race was never heard of until modern times the greeks would have regarded it as a monstrosity previously men could be divided simply into the learned and the ignorant those more or less the one and those more or less the other but your specialist cannot be brought in under either of these two categories he is not learned for he is formally ignorant of all that does not enter into his specialty but neither is he ignorant because he is a scientist and knows very well his own tiny portion of the universe we shall have to say that he is a learned ignoramus which is a very serious matter as it implies that he is a person who is ignorant not in the fashion of the ignorant man but with all the petulance of one who is learned in his own special line it is the custom among those who are called practical men to condemn any man capable of a wide survey as a visionary no man is
