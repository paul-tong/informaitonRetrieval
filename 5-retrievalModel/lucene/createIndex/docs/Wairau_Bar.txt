the wairau bar or te pokohiwi is a 19-hectare 47-acre gravel bar formed where the wairau river meets the sea in cloudy bay marlborough north-eastern south island new zealand it is an important archaeological site settled by explorers from east polynesia who arrived in new zealand about 1280 it is the earliest known human settlement in new zealand at the time of the occupation it is believed to have been a low scrub-covered island 2 to 3 metres 7 to 10ft high 11 kilometres 068mi long and 04 kilometres 025mi wide history the site was discovered in 1939 by then schoolboy jim eyles who in 1942 found more artefacts early investigations with roger duff unearthed a burial site bones were scattered and close to the surface this was originally believed to have been due to ploughing but work by bruce mcfadgen shows that at some stage probably between the two periods of occupation the site was subject to either large storm surge waves or a tsunami which probably contributed to the scattering using the techniques of the time about 2000 artefacts and 44 human skeletons were removed and examined in detail the record seems to show that the partial skeletons of several children were found in shallow graves but these were in such poor condition and scattered that duff was either unable or unwilling to keep the fragments using the methods of those days the examination showed that the people were using the same cultural methods as those in eastern polynesia particularly the marquesas islands sixty-nine adzes were found at wairau bar of which only three were made of greenstone eighty small one-piece triangular stone or bone fishing lures with lashed unbarbed hook were found skeletal analysis in 2009 a more modern analysis by buckley et al found the skeletons had a wide range of estimated ages none of the skeletons were from elderly people the oldest was 39 and the second oldest was 36 most of the skeletons were from people aged in their 20s no children and only 1 teenagers skeleton was found this is consistent with younger people being buried elsewhere a practice that was quite common in the south pacific there was only one childs skeleton the 21 skeletons with teeth all exhibited some developmental enamel disorders showing they had suffered long stressful periods during childhood but survived to reasonably healthy adulthood tooth decay was rare especially amongst males a similar trait to neolithic people of the americas north american indians many of the skeletons showed multiple signs of stress such as harris lines on x-rays of long bones such as the tibia caused by either infection or a poor diet tooth wear was substantial among older individuals with teeth worn to the roots but this did not seem to be due to bracken fern root chewing all the adults showed healed bone fractures indicating a well-balanced diet and a supportive community structure several skeletons showed features that are interpreted as being caused by tuberculosis tb the presence of tb was yet to be confirmed by dna analysis in 2010 anaemia was common as was arthritis the average height of the males was 175 centimetres 69in and the females 161 centimetres 63in these figures show the early colonisers were tall compared to most polynesians the skeletons were all found in shallow graves with the heads pointing towards the east and the feet to the west as was the practice in eastern polynesia the archaeological layers were shallow site use the later 20092010 study using more precise modern methods resulted in the site being more accurately dated by the radiocarbon method to 12881300 ce the site appeared to be occupied twice over a period of about 20 years which is consistent with information from other early polynesian colonisation sites in new zealand accurate dates were obtained from moa egg fragments found in grave and midden sites buried with the skeletons were moa bone reel necklaces whole moa eggs used as water carriers argillite adze heads carved serpentine that looked like shark and whale teeth harpoon heads and tattoo chisels few nephrite jade or greenstone artefacts were found it is believed the site was primarily a factory for making stone adze heads it has been estimated from the adze heads found and the large area of stone flakes that about 12000 adze heads were made here or about 400 to 500 per year argillitethe most common adze head material is hard compressed mudstone it is found at durville island only 100 kilometres 62mi away from wairau bar a maori argillite quarry is located in the hills behind nelson city such large numbers of adze heads have implications about trade in the early archaic period one adze found in the 2009 study has been identified by archaeologist richard walter as tahanga basalt from tahanga hill near opito a well known moahunter area it was of quadrangular shapeknown as type 1 identical in design to those use in the cook island at the same time also found were chert from kaikoura which was commonly used for making holes pumice from the volcanic plateauwhich was used as floats and for making small handheld fire bowls and small amounts of greenstone from the west coast which was made into two adze heads this indicates that the wairau bar moa hunters travelled extensively through new zealand exploring the land adze heads are associated with shaping wood especially in the making of waka the stone head was lashed to an l-shaped natural crook and swung so the blade struck the wood more or less horizontally an investigation by a team from otago university found a huge stone-lined umu or hangi pit earth oven 15 metres 49ft deep by 4 metres 13ft acrossestimated to be big enough to feed 1000 people by a local maori familiar with modern hangi however these large hangi or umu pits were identified in 1968 in the kermadecs by roger duff as being typical polynesian umu ti the purpose of the large pit was to cook the taproot of the ti plant this was a common method of reducing the tuberous root to a sugary pulp the ti can be cultivated easily but is slow growing the root is about 900 millimetres 35in long by 90 millimetres 35in wide to a point it is cooked very slowly in an umu for 12 to 24hours the plant is usually associated with the far north of new zealand but may have been grown further south during the warmer climatic period associated with early polynesian settlement a geophysics study showed that it was only one of six such pits in a rough horseshoe shape on the edge of a lagoon the study also showed the site to be much bigger than previously thoughtat least 11 hectares 27 acres and possibly larger as two boundaries have not been accurately plotted at least 50percent of the area was intact by 2007 only 2percent of the site had been scientifically investigated intact skeletons many minus the head were found in four groups with the oldest 1-7 being closer to the sea and at the western end of the site these have been shown by dna studies to be people who had lived in east polynesia the largest group of skeletons 15-43 were in an area to the east which covered an oval area 30 by 50 metres 98 by 164ft these people are believed to be moa hunters who lived their lives in new zealand based on bone and teeth dna analysis the main habitation area was centralabout 25 to 50 metres 82 to 164ft from the southern lagoon edge there were three zones of cooking and surface midden debris all about 100 by 30 metres 328 by 98ft approximately the earliest zone was alongside the lagoon and the latter on the ocean side of the island at the time of the second occupation of the island the second site was protected from the ocean by a long and narrow boulder bank there are two adze-making sitesone adjacent to the early occupation zone and the second adjacent to the later burial site the most intensely studied indicates a right handed person sitting in the porch area of a small whare they sat in front of a flat stone on a path cobbled with small round rocks chipping off flakes of argillite with a hammer stone of quartzite the limited studies done so far indicate a sizeable village it is apparent that bodies were commonly buried about 60 metres 200ft from the cooking and working zones exploitation of fauna after being used for cooking each umu had subsequently been used as a midden the bottom layer of the midden showed that at the very earliest occupation time shellfish such as mussels were much larger averaging 250 millimetres 98in long the lower layers of the midden also showed that early moa bones were not smashed to get at the marrow as was common in the upper layers whale bones were found in the lower layer mainly moa leg bones were found indicating that moa were hunted inland and brought to the site for cooking bones from all five moa species located in the upper south island were found as well as the remains of numerous butchered moa seals porpoises the extinct haasts eagle eyles harrier new zealand swan and new zealand raven kur maori dogs tuatara kiore shellfish such as pipi paua cockles and marine bones from eels skate sunfish and sharks were found there anderson and smith in their 1996 study stated that the first colonists enjoyed a sustained assault on the local megafauna at the time of the latest investigation the local rangitne iwi reburied 60 skeletons claimed to be their forebears in a formal ceremony at the lagoon site shell link to east polynesia a study of a turret shell artifact completed in 2011 shows a direct link between the wairau bar site and east polynesia this is only the second artifact found in new zealand originating from east polynesia dated to the early polynesian colonial period the other is the early east polynesian pearl lure found at tairua identified by a powell of auckland museum the shell tool is a modified spiral gastropod shell these tools were used as small chisels or gouges possibly for enlarging holes the point of the turret shell was removed and the remains honed to a chisel point of about 60 degrees by grinding although found in various east polynesian islands the most common site by far is faalia ruahine in the society islands where many have been located from the same period the significance of the find that was dug up 60 years ago was not realised until recently 2012 dna study results dr lisa matisoo-smith and dr michael knapp from new zealands otago university have released the results of a recent bone and teeth dna study carried out on early polynesian migrants to new zealand who lived at wairau bar about 12851300 ad the results of dna analysis reinforce the idea that some these people were original settlers from east polynesia as they had a very different diet based on soft starchy food the two other burial groups showed a very different more varied diet consistent with being raised in new zealand scientists found that there was a wide range of dna mutations indicating that settlers were part of a reasonably large group this indicate a planned migration rather than isolated random groups one of the mutations was associated with insulin rejection as found in type 2 diabetes this reinforces the mathematical modelling done in the past that shows the same pattern work will now begin on tracing east polynesian populations that have the same dna mutations in order to discover the specific homelands of the wairau bar settlers the dna pattern is very similar to that found in the marquesas islands in east polynesia at the same time antiquity june 1999 t higham a anderson c jacomb
