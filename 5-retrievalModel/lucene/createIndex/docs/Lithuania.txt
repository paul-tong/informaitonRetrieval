baltic branch of the indo-european language family for centuries the southeastern shores of the baltic sea were inhabited by various baltic tribes in the 1230s the lithuanian lands were united by mindaugas the king of lithuania and the first unified lithuanian state the kingdom of lithuania was created on 6 july 1253 during the 14th century the grand duchy of lithuania was the largest country in europe present-day lithuania belarus ukraine and parts of poland and russia were the territories of the grand duchy with the lublin union of 1569 lithuania and poland formed a voluntary two-state personal union the polishlithuanian commonwealth the commonwealth lasted more than two centuries until neighbouring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795 with the russian empire annexing most of lithuanias territory as world war i neared its end lithuanias act of independence was signed on 16 february 1918 declaring the founding of the modern republic of lithuania in the

lithuania lithuania is a member of the european union the council of europe eurozone schengen agreement nato and oecd it is also a member of the nordic investment bank and part of nordic-baltic cooperation of northern european countries the united nations human development index lists lithuania as a very high human development country etymology the first known record of the name of lithuania lithuanian lietuva is in a 9 march 1009 story of saint bruno in the quedlinburg chronicle the chronicle recorded a latinized form of the name lietuva litua pronounced litua due to the lack of reliable evidence the true meaning of the name is unknown nowadays scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions since the word lietuva has a suffix -uva the original word should have no suffix a likely candidate is liet because many baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms usually such names evolved through the following process hydronym toponym ethnonym lietava a small river not far from kernav the core area of the early lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual grand duchy of lithuania is usually credited as the source of the name however the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation on the other hand such a naming is not unprecedented in world history artras dubonis proposed another hypothesis that lietuva relates to the word leiiai plural of leitis from the middle of the 13th century leiiai were a distinct warrior social group of the lithuanian society subordinate to the lithuanian ruler or the state itself the word leiiai is used in the 1416th-century historical sources as an ethnonym for lithuanians but not samogitians and is still used usually poetically or in historical contexts in the latvian language which is closely related to lithuanian history prehistory the first people settled in the territory of lithuania after the last glacial period in the 10th millennium bc kunda neman and narva cultures they were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements in the 8th millennium bc the climate became much warmer and forests developed the inhabitants of what is now lithuania then traveled less and engaged in local hunting gathering and fresh-water fishing agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium bc due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land crafts and trade also started to form at this time over a millennium the indo-europeans who arrived in the 3rd 2nd millennium bc mixed with the local population and formed various baltic tribes the baltic tribes did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the roman empire but they did maintain trade contacts see amber road tacitus in his study germania described the aesti people inhabitants of the south-eastern baltic sea shores who were probably balts around the year 97 ad the western balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first ptolemy in the 2nd century ad knew of the galindians and yotvingians and early medieval chroniclers mentioned old prussians curonians and semigallians the lithuanian language is considered to be very conservative for its close connection to indo-european roots it is believed to have differentiated from the latvian language the most closely related existing language around the 7th century traditional lithuanian pagan customs and mythology with many archaic elements were long preserved rulers bodies were cremated up until the conversion to christianity the descriptions of the cremation ceremonies of the grand dukes algirdas and kstutis have survived grand duchy of lithuania from the 9th to the 11th centuries coastal balts were subjected to raids by the vikings and the kings of denmark collected tribute at times during the 1011th centuries lithuanian territories were among the lands paying tribute to kievan rus and yaroslav the wise was among the ruthenian rulers who invaded lithuania from 1040 from the mid-12th century it was the lithuanians who were invading ruthenian territories in 1183 polotsk and pskov were ravaged and even the distant and powerful novgorod republic was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging lithuanian war machine toward the end of the 12th century from the late 12th century an organized lithuanian military force existed it was used for external raids plundering and the gathering of slaves such military and pecuniary activities fostered social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in lithuania this initiated the formation of early statehood from which the grand duchy of lithuania developed initially inhabited by fragmented baltic tribes in the 1230s the lithuanian lands were united by mindaugas who was crowned as king of lithuania on 6 july 1253 after his assassination in 1263 pagan lithuania was a target of the christian crusades of the teutonic knights and the livonian order siege of pilnai is noted for the lithuanians heroic defense against the intruders despite the devastating century-long struggle with the orders the grand duchy of lithuania expanded rapidly overtaking former slavic principalities of kievan rus on 22 september 1236 the battle of saul between samogitians and the livonian brothers of the sword took place close to iauliai the livonian brothers were smashed during it and their further conquest of the balts lands were stopped the battle inspired rebellions among the curonians semigallians selonians oeselians tribes previously conquered by the sword-brothers some thirty years worth of conquests on the left bank of daugava were lost in 2000 the lithuanian and latvian parliaments declared 22 september to be the day of baltic unity according to the legend grand duke gediminas was once hunting near the vilnia river tired after the successful hunt he settled in for the night and dreamed of a huge iron wolf standing on top a hill and howling as strong and loud as a hundred wolves krivis pagan priest lizdeika interpreted the dream that the iron wolf represents vilnius castles gediminas obeying the will of gods built the city and gave it the name vilnius from the stream of the vilnia river in 1362 or 1363 grand duke algirdas achieved a decisive victory in the battle of blue waters against golden horde and stopped its further expansion in the present-day ukraine the victory brought the city of kiev and a large part of present-day ukraine including sparsely populated podolia and dykra under the control of the expanding grand duchy of lithuania after taking kiev lithuania became a direct neighbor and rival of the grand duchy of moscow by the end of the 14th century lithuania was one of the largest countries in europe and included present-day belarus ukraine and parts of poland and russia the geopolitical situation between the west and the east determined the multicultural and multi-confessional character of the grand duchy of lithuania the ruling elite practised religious tolerance and chancery slavonic language was used as an auxiliary language to the latin for official documents in 1385 the grand duke jogaila accepted polands offer to become its king jogaila embarked on gradual christianization of lithuania and established a personal union between poland and lithuania lithuania was one of the last pagan areas of europe to adopt christianity after two civil wars vytautas the great became the grand duke of lithuania in 1392 during his reign lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion centralization of the state began and the lithuanian nobility became increasingly prominent in state politics in the great battle of the vorskla river in 1399 the combined forces of tokhtamysh and vytautas were defeated by the mongols thanks to close cooperation the armies of lithuania and poland achieved a great victory over the teutonic knights in 1410 at the battle of grunwald one of the largest battles of medieval europe in january 1429 at the congress of lutsk vytautas received the title of king of lithuania with the backing of sigismund holy roman emperor but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by polish magnates in autumn of 1430 another crown was sent but vytautas died in the trakai island castle several days before it reached lithuania he was buried in the cathedral of vilnius after the deaths of jogaila and vytautas the lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union between poland and lithuania independently selecting grand dukes from the jagiellon dynasty but at the end of the 15th century lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with poland when the growing power of the grand duchy of moscow threatened lithuanias russian principalities and sparked the muscovitelithuanian wars and the livonian war on 8 september 1514 battle of orsha between lithuanians commanded by the grand hetman konstanty ostrogski and muscovites was fought according to rerum moscoviticarum commentarii by sigismund von herberstein the primary source for information on the battle the much smaller army of polandlithuania under 30000 men defeated a force of 80000 muscovite soldiers capturing their camp and commander the battle destroyed a military alliance against lithuania and poland thousands of muscovites were captured as prisoners and used as laborers in the lithuanian manors while konstanty ostrogski delivered the captured muscovite flags to the cathedral of vilnius the livonian war was ceased for ten years with a truce of yam-zapolsky signed on 15 january 1582 according to which the already polishlithuanian commonwealth recovered livonia polotsk and velizh but transferred velikiye luki to the tsardom of russia the truce was extended for twenty years in 1600 when a diplomatic mission to moscow led by lew sapieha concluded negotiations with tsar boris godunov the truce was broken when the poles invaded muscovy in 1605 polishlithuanian commonwealth the polishlithuanian commonwealth was created in 1569 by the union of lublin as a member of the commonwealth lithuania retained its institutions including a separate army currency and statutory laws - the statute of lithuania eventually polonization affected all aspects of lithuanian life politics language culture and national identity from the mid-16th to the mid-17th centuries culture arts and education flourished fueled by the renaissance and the protestant reformation from 1573 the kings of poland and grand dukes of lithuania were elected by the nobility who were granted ever increasing golden liberties these liberties especially the liberum veto led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state the commonwealth reached its golden age in the early 17th century its powerful parliament was dominated by nobles who were reluctant to get involved in the thirty years war this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary europe the commonwealth held its own against sweden the tsardom of russia and vassals of the ottoman empire and even launched successful expansionist offensives against its neighbors in several invasions during the time of troubles commonwealth troops entered russia and managed to take moscow and hold it from 27 september 1610 to 4 november 1612 when they were driven out after a siege in 1655 after the extinguishing battle for the first time in history lithuanian capital vilnius was taken by the foreign army russian army looted the city splendid churches manors 8000-10000 citizens were killed the city burned 17 days those who returned after the catastrophe didnt recognise the city russian occupation of grand duchy of lithuania lasted up to 1661 many artefacts and cultural heritage were either lost or looted significant parts of the state archive lithuanian metrica collected since 13th century were lost and the rest is moved out of the country during the northern wars 16551661 the lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the swedish army almost all territory of grand duchy of lithuania was occupied by swedish and russian armies this period is known as tvanas the deluge before it could fully recover lithuania was ravaged during the great northern war 17001721 the war a plague and a famine caused the deaths of approximately 40 of the countrys population foreign powers especially russia became dominant in the domestic politics of the commonwealth numerous fractions among the nobility used the golden liberties to prevent any reforms the constitution of 3 may 1791 was adopted by the great sejm parliament of the polishlithuanian commonwealth trying to save the state the legislation was designed to redress the commonwealths political defects due to the system of golden liberties also known as the nobles democracy had conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility szlachta and over time had corrupted politics the constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered by some of the countrys magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy it introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom it banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto which had put the sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm it was drafted in relation to a copy of the united states constitution others have called it the worlds second-oldest codified national governmental constitution after the 1787 us constitution russian empire eventually the commonwealth was partitioned in 1772 1792 and 1795 by the russian empire prussia and habsburg austria the largest area of lithuanian territory became part of the russian empire after unsuccessful uprisings in 1831 and 1863 the tsarist authorities implemented a number of russification policies in 1840 the third statute of lithuania was abolished they banned the lithuanian press closed cultural and educational institutions and made lithuania part of a new administrative region called northwestern krai the russification failed owing to an extensive network of book smugglers and secret lithuanian home schooling after the russo-turkish war 18771878 when german diplomats assigned what were seen as russian spoils of war to turkey the relationship between russia and the german empire became complicated the russian empire resumed the construction of fortresses at its western borders

first-class defensive structure in the entire state the 65km 25sqmi kaunas fortress large numbers of lithuanians went to the united states in 18671868 after a faminesimonas daukantas promoted a return to lithuanias pre-commonwealth traditions which he depicted as a golden age of lithuania and a renewal of the native culture based on the lithuanian language and customs with those ideas in mind he wrote already in 1822 a history of lithuania in lithuanian darbai senj lietuvi ir emaii the deeds of ancient lithuanians and samogitians though still not yet published at that time a colleague of sdaukantas teodor narbutt wrote in polish a voluminous ancient history of the lithuanian nation 18351841 where he likewise expounded and expanded further on the concept of historic lithuania whose days of glory had ended with the union of lublin in 1569 narbutt invoking the german scholarship pointed out the relationship between the lithuanian and sanskrit languages a lithuanian national revival inspired by the ancient lithuanian history language and culture laid the foundations of the modern lithuanian nation and independent lithuania 20th and 21st centuries 19181939 as a result of

as the president of lithuania the number of people in a group fell to 35 people despite the fact that the guerrilla warfare did not achieve its goal of liberating lithuania and that it resulted in more than 20000 deaths the armed resistance de facto demonstrated that lithuania did not voluntarily join the ussr and it also legitimized the will of the people of lithuania to be independent even

press and catholic literature the most active participants of the movement included vincentas sladkeviius sigitas tamkeviius and nijol sadnait in 1972 after romas kalantas public self-immolation the

meters per year while production is only 45 percent of all mineral water resources vilnius is the only baltic capital that uses centralized water supplying from deep water springs which are protected from pollution and has no nitrates or nitrites that are harmful to the human body water is cleaned without chemicals in lithuania about 20 of the consumed water in the state is a non-filtered very high quality water energy systematic diversification of energy imports and resources is lithuanias key energy strategy long term aims were defined in national energy independence strategy in 2012 by

electricity grid with the synchronous grid of continental europe has started in 2016 208 of electricity consumed in lithuania came from renewable sources demographics since the neolithic period the native inhabitants of the lithuanian territory have not been replaced by any other ethnic group so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements although without being actually isolated from them the lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups a 2004 analysis of mtdna in the lithuanian population revealed that lithuanians are close to the slavic and finno-ugric speaking

cases in rural areas are five times more frequent than in cities and fourth highest age-standardized suicide rate in the world according to who according to experts this number was largely influenced

institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket the ministry of health also runs a few health care

as a result the student-teacher ratio is decreasing and expenditure per student is increasing but schools particularly in rural areas are forced into reorganizations and consolidations as with other baltic nations in particular latvia the large volume of higher education graduates within the country coupled with the high rate of spoken second languages is contributing to an education brain drain
