the observable universe is a spherical region of the universe comprising all matter that can be observed from earth at the present time because electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion there are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe assuming the universe is isotropic the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction that is the observable universe has a spherical volume a ball centered on the observer every location in the universe has its own observable universe which may or may not overlap with the one centered on earth the word observable in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect light or other information from an object or whether there is anything to be detected it refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself because no signals can travel faster than light any object farther away from us than light could travel in the age of the universe estimated as of 2015 around 7010137990000000000137990021billion years simply cannot be detected as the signals could not have reached us yet sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the visible universe which includes only signals emitted since recombinationand the observable universe which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion the big bang in traditional physical cosmology the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology according to calculations the current comoving distanceproper distance which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emittedto particles from which the cosmic microwave background radiation cmbr was emitted which represent the radius of the visible universe is about 140 billion parsecs about 457 billion light-years while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 143 billion parsecs about 466 billion light-years about 2 larger the radius of the observable universe is therefore estimated to be about 465 billion light-years and its diameter about 285 gigaparsecs 93 billion light-years 8810 kilometres or 5510 miles the total mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be calculated using the critical density and the diameter of the observable universe to be about 15 10kg in november 2018 astronomers reported that the extragalactic background light ebl amounted to 4 10 photons since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future the light emitted from all distant objects past some time dependent on their current redshift will never reach the earth in the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light for instance objects with the current redshift z from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 46 billion years in addition light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance currently about 19 billion parsecs will never reach earth the universe versus the observable universe some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the big bang to have had enough time to reach earth and so lie outside the observable universe in the future light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel so additional regions will become observable however due to hubbles law regions sufficiently distant from the earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light special relativity prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding see uses of the proper distance for a discussion and furthermore the expansion rate appears to be accelerating due to dark energy assuming dark energy remains constant an unchanging cosmological constant so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate there is a future visibility limit beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the earth a subtlety is that because the hubble parameter is decreasing with time there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the earth eventually this future visibility limit is calculated at a comoving distance of 19 billion parsecs 62 billion light-years assuming the universe will keep expanding forever which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift as discussed in the following paragraph is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 236 though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely redshifted due to ongoing expansion so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible an additional subtlety is that a galaxy at a given comoving distance is defined to lie within the observable universe if we can receive signals emitted by the galaxy at any age in its past history say a signal sent from the galaxy only 500 million years after the big bang but because of the universes expansion there may be some later age at which a signal sent from the same galaxy can never reach the earth at any point in the infinite future so for example we might never see what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years after the big bang even though it remains at the same comoving distance comoving distance is defined to be constant with timeunlike proper distance which is used to define recession velocity due to the expansion of space which is less than the comoving radius of the observable universe this fact can be used to define a type of cosmic event horizon whose distance from the earth changes over time for example the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years meaning that a signal from an event happening at present can eventually reach the earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away but the signal will never reach the earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term universe to mean observable universe this can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is causally disconnected from the earth although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe no evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2d surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge it is plausible that the galaxies within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe according to the theory of cosmic inflation initially introduced by its founder alan guth and by d kazanas if it is assumed that inflation began about 10 seconds after the big bang then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age that would suggest that at present the entire universes size is at least 310 times the radius of the observable universe there are also lower estimates claiming that the entire universe is in excess of 250 times larger than the observable universe and also higher estimates implying that the universe is at least 10 times larger than the observable universe if the universe is finite but unbounded it is also possible that the universe is smaller than the observable universe in this case what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe it is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history and consequently might appear quite different bielewicz et al claims to establish a lower bound of 279 gigaparsecs 91 billion light-years on the diameter of the last scattering surface since this is only a lower bound the paper leaves open the possibility that the whole universe is much larger even infinite this value is based on matching-circle analysis of the wmap 7 year data this approach has been disputed size the comoving distance from earth to the edge of the observable universe is about 1426 gigaparsecs 465 billion light-years or 44010 meters in any direction the observable universe is thus a sphere with a diameter of about 285 gigaparsecs 93 billion light-years or 8810 meters assuming that space is roughly flat in the sense of being a euclidean space this size corresponds to a comoving volume of about 700412200000000000012210gpc 700542200000000000042210gly or 708035700000000000035710m the figures quoted above are distances now in cosmological time not distances at the time the light was emitted for example the cosmic microwave background radiation that we see right now was emitted at the time of photon decoupling estimated to have occurred about 7005380000000000000380000 years after the big bang which occurred around 138 billion years ago this radiation was emitted by matter that has in the intervening time mostly condensed into galaxies and those galaxies are now calculated to be about 46 billion light-years from us to estimate the distance to that matter at the time the light was emitted we may first note that according to the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric which is used to model the expanding universe if at the present time we receive light with a redshift of z then the scale factor at the time the light was originally emitted is given by a t 1 1 z displaystyle atfrac 11z wmap nine-year results combined with other measurements give the redshift of photon decoupling as z7003109164000000000109164047 which implies that the scale factor at the time of photon decoupling would be 109264 so if the matter that originally emitted the oldest cmbr photons has a present distance of 46 billion light-years then at the time of decoupling when the photons were originally emitted the distance would have been only about 42 million light-years misconceptions on its size many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe some of these figures are listed below with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them large-scale structure sky surveys and mappings of the various wavelength bands of electromagnetic radiation in particular 21-cm emission have yielded much information on the content and character of the universes structure the organization of structure appears to follow as a hierarchical model with organization up to the scale of superclusters and filaments larger than this at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs there seems to be no continued structure a phenomenon that has been referred to as the end of greatness walls filaments nodes and voids the organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level though most cosmologists rarely address astrophysics on that scale stars are organized into galaxies which in turn form galaxy groups galaxy clusters superclusters sheets walls and filaments which are separated by immense voids creating a vast foam-like structure sometimes called the cosmic web prior to 1989 it was commonly assumed that virialized galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction however since the early 1980s more and more structures have been discovered in 1983 adrian webster identified the webster lqg a large quasar group consisting of 5 quasars the discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe in 1987 robert brent tully identified the piscescetus supercluster complex the galaxy filament in which the milky way resides it is about 1 billion light-years across that same year an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered the giant void which measures 13 billion light-years across based on redshift survey data in 1989 margaret geller and john huchra discovered the great wall a sheet of galaxies more than 500 million light-years long and 200 million light-years wide but only 15 million light-years thick the existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from redshifts two years later astronomers roger g clowes and luis e campusano discovered the clowescampusano lqg a large quasar group measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement in april 2003 another large-scale structure was discovered the sloan great wall in august 2007 a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation eridanus it coincides with the cmb cold spot a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model this supervoid could cause the cold spot but to do so it would have to be improbably big possibly a billion light-years across almost as big as the giant void mentioned above another large-scale structure is the ssa22 protocluster a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across in 2011 a large quasar group was discovered u111 measuring about 25 billion light-years across on january 11 2013 another large quasar group the huge-lqg was discovered which was measured to be four billion light-years across the largest known structure in the universe at that time in november 2013 astronomers discovered the herculescorona borealis great wall an even bigger structure twice as large as the former it was defined by the mapping of gamma-ray bursts end of greatness the end of greatness is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100mpc roughly 300 million light-years where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the universe is homogenized and isotropized in accordance with the cosmological principle at this scale no pseudo-random fractalness is apparent the superclusters and filaments seen in smaller surveys are randomized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent it was not until the redshift surveys of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed observations another indicator of large-scale structure is the lyman-alpha forest this is a collection of absorption lines that appear in the spectra of light from quasars which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic mostly hydrogen gas these sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear gravitational lensing bending of light by gravitation can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source this is caused when foreground objects such as galaxies curve surrounding spacetime as predicted by general relativity and deflect passing light rays rather usefully strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies making them easier to detect weak lensing gravitational shear by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure the large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses redshift to measure distances to galaxies for example galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it and so fall towards it and so are slightly blueshifted compared to how they would be if there were no cluster on the near side things are slightly redshifted thus the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance an opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center and when these random motions are converted to redshifts the cluster appears elongated this creates a finger of godthe illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the earth cosmography of earths cosmic neighborhood at the centre of the hydra-centaurus supercluster a gravitational anomaly called the great attractor affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across these galaxies are all redshifted in accordance with hubbles law this indicates that they are receding from us and from each other but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies the great attractor discovered in 1986 lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years 250 million is the most recent estimate in the direction of the hydra and centaurus constellations in its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies many of which are colliding with their neighbours or radiating large amounts of radio waves in 1987 astronomer r brent tully of the university of hawaiis institute of astronomy identified what he called the piscescetus supercluster complex a structure one billion light-years long and 150 million light-years across in which he claimed the local supercluster was embedded mass of ordinary matter the mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10 tonnes or 10 kg in this context mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the interstellar medium ism and the intergalactic medium igm however it excludes dark matter and dark energy this quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density the calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite estimates based on critical density critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat if there is no dark energy it is also the density for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse from the friedmann equations the value for c displaystyle rho c critical density is where g is the gravitational constant and h h0 is the present value of the hubble constant the current value for h0 due to the european space agencys planck telescope is h0 6715 kilometers per second per mega parsec this gives a critical density of 697385000000000000008510kgm commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter this density includes four significant types of energymass ordinary matter 48 neutrinos 01 cold dark matter 268 and dark energy 683 note that although neutrinos are standard model particles they are listed separately because they are difficult to detect and so different from ordinary matter the density of ordinary matter as measured by planck is 48 of the total critical density or 697240800000000000040810kgm to convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume a value based on the radius of the observable universe since the universe has been expanding for 138 billion years the comoving distance radius is now about 466 billion light-years thus volume 43r equals 708035800000000000035810m and the mass of ordinary matter equals density 697240800000000000040810kgm times volume 708035800000000000035810m or 705314600000000000014610kg matter content number of atoms assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about 705314499999999999914510kg refer to previous section and assuming all atoms are hydrogen atoms which are about 74 of all atoms in our galaxy by mass see abundance of the chemical elements calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom 705314499999999999914510kg divided by 697316700000000000016710kg the result is approximately 10 hydrogen atoms most distant objects the most distant astronomical object yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified gn-z11 in 2009 a gamma ray burst grb 090423 was found to have a redshift of 82 which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old the burst happened approximately 13 billion years ago so a distance of about 13 billion light-years was widely quoted in the media or sometimes a more precise figure of 13035 billion light-years though this would be the light travel distance see distance measures cosmology rather than the proper distance used in both hubbles law and in defining the size of the observable universe cosmologist ned wright argues against the common use of light travel distance in astronomical press releases on this page and at the bottom of the page offers online calculators that can be used to calculate the current proper distance to a distant object in a flat universe based on either the redshift z or the light travel time the proper distance for a redshift of 82 would be about 92 gpc or about 30 billion light-years another record-holder for most distant object is a galaxy observed through and located beyond abell 2218 also with a light travel distance of approximately 13 billion light-years from earth with observations from the hubble telescope indicating a redshift between 66 and 71 and observations from keck telescopes indicating a redshift towards the upper end of this range around 7 the galaxys light now observable on earth would have begun to emanate from its source about 750 million years after the big bang horizons the limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limitbased on various physical constraintsthe extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe the most famous horizon is the particle horizon which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite age of the universe additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations larger than the particle horizon owing to the expansion of space an optical horizon at the surface of last scattering and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for neutrinos and gravitational waves
