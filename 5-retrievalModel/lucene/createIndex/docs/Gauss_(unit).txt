the gauss abbreviated as g or gs is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density or magnetic induction b it is named after german mathematician and physicist carl friedrich gauss one gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter the cgs system has been superseded by the international system of units si which uses the tesla symbol t as the unit of magnetic flux density one gauss equals 110 tesla 100 t so 1 tesla 10000 gauss unit name and convention as with all units whose names are derived from a persons name the first letter of its symbol is uppercase g but when the unit is spelled out it should be written in lowercase gauss unless it begins a sentence unit conversions according to the system of gaussian units cgs the gauss is the unit of magnetic flux density b and the equivalent of mxcm while the oersted is the unit of magnetizing field h one tesla t is equal to 10 gauss and one ampere a per meter is equal to 4x10 oersted the units for magnetic flux which is the integral of magnetic field over an area are the weber wb in the si and the maxwell mx in the cgs system the conversion factor is 10 since flux is the integral of field over an area area having the units of the square of distance thus 10 magnetic field conversion factor times the square of 10 linear distance conversion factor ie centimetres per meter 1010 x 10 typical values 1010 gauss the magnetic field of the human brain 1010 gauss the magnetic field of galactic molecular clouds 025060 gauss the earths magnetic field at its surface 25 gauss the earths magnetic field in its core 50 gauss a typical refrigerator magnet 100 gauss an iron magnet 1500 gauss - within a sun spot 10000 to 13000 gauss remanence of a neodymium-iron-boron nib magnet 16000 to 22000 gauss - saturation of high permeability iron alloys used in transformers 300070000 gauss a medical magnetic resonance imaging machine 1010 gauss the surface of a neutron star 410 gauss the quantum electrodynamic threshold 10 gauss the magnetic field of some newly created magnetars 10 gauss the upper limit to neutron star magnetism see also centimetregramsecond system of units gaussian units carl friedrich gauss magnetic field
