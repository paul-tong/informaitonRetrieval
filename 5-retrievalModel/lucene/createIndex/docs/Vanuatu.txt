island country located in the south pacific ocean the archipelago which is of volcanic origin is 1750 kilometres 1090mi east of northern australia 540 kilometres 340mi northeast of new caledonia east of new guinea southeast of the solomon islands and west of fiji vanuatu was first inhabited by melanesian people the first europeans to visit the islands were a spanish expedition led by portuguese navigator fernandes de queirs who arrived on the largest island in 1606 since the portuguese and spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of spain in 1580 following the vacancy of the portuguese throne which lasted for sixty years until 1640 when the portuguese monarchy was restored queirs claimed the archipelago for spain as part of the colonial spanish east indies and named it la austrialia del espritu santo in the 1880s france and the united kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the new hebrides through an anglofrench condominium an independence movement arose in the 1970s and the republic of vanuatu was founded in 1980 since independence the country is a member of the united nations commonwealth of nations organisation internationale de la francophonie and the pacific islands forum etymology vanuatus name is derived from the word vanua land or home which occurs in several austronesian languages and the word tu stand together the two words indicated the independent status of the new country history the prehistory of vanuatu is obscure archaeological evidence supports the theory that people speaking austronesian languages first came to the islands about 3300 years ago pottery fragments have been found dating to 13001100 bc the vanuatu group of islands first had contact with europeans in 1606 when the portuguese explorer pedro fernandes de queirs sailing for the spanish crown arrived on the largest island and called the group of islands la austrialia del espiritu santo or the southern land of the holy spirit believing he had arrived in terra australis australia the spanish established a short-lived settlement at big bay on the north side of the island the name espiritu santo remains to this day europeans did not return until 1768 when louis antoine de bougainville rediscovered the islands on 22 may naming them the great cyclades in 1774 captain cook named the islands the new hebrides a name that would last until independence in 1980 in 1825 the trader peter dillons discovery of sandalwood on the island of erromango began a rush of immigrants that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant polynesian workers and indigenous melanesians during the 1860s planters in australia fiji new caledonia and the samoa islands in need of labourers encouraged a long-term indentured labour trade called blackbirding at the height of the labour trade more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad fragmentary evidence indicates that the current population of vanuatu is greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times in the 19th century missionaries both roman catholic and protestant arrived on the islands settlers also came looking for land on which to establish cotton plantations when international cotton prices collapsed they switched to coffee cocoa bananas and most successfully coconuts initially british subjects from australia made up the majority but the establishment of the caledonian company of the new hebrides in 1882 soon tipped the balance in favour of french subjects by around the start of the 20th century the french outnumbered the british two to one the jumbling of french and british interests in the islands brought petitions for one or another of the two powers to annexe the territory the convention of 16 october 1887 established a joint naval commission for the sole purpose of protecting french and british citizens with no claim to jurisdiction over internal native affairs in 1906 however france and the united kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly called the british-french condominium it was a unique form of government with separate governmental systems that came together only in a joint court the condominiums authority was extended in the anglo-french protocol of 1914 although this was not formally ratified until 1922 melanesians were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power and were officially stateless in the 1920s indentured workers from french annam now part of vietnam came to work in the plantations in the new hebrides they were 437 in 1923 5413 in 1930 then after the crisis 1630 in 1937 there was some social and political unrest among them in 1947 challenges to the condominium government began in the early 1940s the arrival of americans during the second world war with their informal habits and relative wealth contributed to the rise of nationalism in the islands the belief in a mythical messianic figure named john frum was the basis for an indigenous cargo cult a movement attempting to obtain industrial goods through magic promising melanesian deliverance today john frum is both a religion and a political party with a member in parliament the first political party established in the early 1970s was called the new hebrides national party one of the founders was father walter lini who later became prime minister renamed the vanuaaku pati in 1974 the party pushed for independence which was gained amidst the brief coconut war the independent republic of vanuatu was established in 1980 during the 1990s vanuatu experienced a period of political instability which resulted in a more decentralised government the vanuatu mobile force a paramilitary group attempted a coup in 1996 because of a pay dispute there were allegations of corruption in the government of maxime carlot korman new elections have been held several times since 1997 most recently in 2016 geography vanuatu is a y-shaped archipelago consisting of about 82 relatively small geologically newer islands of volcanic origin 65 of them inhabited with about 1300 kilometres 810mi between the most northern and southern islands two of these islands matthew and hunter are also claimed and controlled by france as part of the french collectivity of new caledonia the country lies between latitudes 13s and 21s and longitudes 166e and 171e the fourteen of vanuatus islands that have surface areas of more than 100 square kilometres 39sqmi are from largest to smallest espiritu santo malakula efate erromango ambrym tanna pentecost epi ambae or aoba gaua vanua lava maewo malo and aneityum or anatom the nations largest towns are the capital port vila on efate and luganville on espiritu santo the highest point in vanuatu is mount tabwemasana at 1879 metres 6165ft on the island of espiritu santo vanuatus total area is roughly 12274 square kilometres 4739sqmi of which its land surface is very limited roughly 4700 square kilometres 1800sqmi most of the islands are steep with unstable soils and little permanent fresh water one estimate made in 2005 is that only 9 of land is used for agriculture 7 with permanent crops plus 2 considered arable the shoreline is mostly rocky with fringing reefs and no continental shelf dropping rapidly into the ocean depths there are several active volcanoes in vanuatu including lopevi mount yasur and several underwater volcanoes volcanic activity is common with an ever-present danger of a major eruption a nearby undersea eruption of 64 magnitude occurred in november 2008 with no casualties and an eruption occurred in 1945 vanuatu is recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion known as the vanuatu rain forests it is part of the australasia ecozone which includes new caledonia the solomon islands australia new guinea and new zealand vanuatus population estimated in 2008 as growing 24 annually is placing increasing pressure on land and resources for agriculture grazing hunting and fishing 90 of vanuatu households fish and consume fish which has caused intense fishing pressure near villages and the depletion of near-shore fish species while well-vegetated most islands show signs of deforestation the islands have been logged particularly of high-value timber subjected to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture and converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches and now show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides many upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded and fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce proper waste disposal as well as water and air pollution are becoming troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages additionally the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems flora and fauna despite its tropical forests vanuatu has a limited number of plant and animal species it has an indigenous flying fox pteropus anetianus flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators they pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees their diet is nectar pollen and fruit and they are commonly called fruit bats they are in decline across their south pacific range however governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection there are no indigenous large mammals the nineteen species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake found only on efate the fiji banded iguana brachylophus fasciatus was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s there are eleven species of bats three unique to vanuatu and sixty-one species of land and water birds while the small polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous the large species arrived with europeans as did domesticated hogs dogs and cattle the ant species of some of the islands of vanuatu were catalogued by e o wilson the region is rich in sea life with more than 4000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of marine fishes cone snails and stonefish carry poison fatal to humans the giant east african land snail arrived only in the 1970s but already has spread from the port-vila region to luganville there are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in vanuatus mangroves and no current breeding population it is said the crocodiles reached the northern part of the islands after cyclones given the island chains proximity to the solomon islands and new guinea where crocodiles are very common climate the climate is tropical with about nine months of warm to hot rainy weather and the possibility of cyclones and three to four months of cooler drier weather characterised by winds from the southeast the water temperature ranges from 22c 72f in winter to 28c 82f in the summer cool between april and september the days become hotter and more humid starting in october the daily temperature ranges from 2032c 6890f southeasterly trade winds occur from may to october vanuatu has a long rainy season with significant rainfall almost every month the wettest and hottest months are december through april which also constitutes the cyclone season the driest months are june through november rainfall averages about 2360 millimetres 93in per year but can be as high as 4000 millimetres 160in in the northern islands in 2015 the united nations university gave vanuatu the highest natural disaster risk of all the countries it measured tropical cyclones in march 2015 cyclone pam impacted much of vanuatu as a category5 severe tropical cyclone causing extensive damage to all the islands and deaths as of 17march2015 the united nations said the official death toll was 11 six from efate and five from tanna and 30were reported injured these numbers are expected to rise as more remote islands are reached cyclone pam is possibly the worst natural disaster in vanuatus history vanuatu lands minister ralph regenvanu said this is the worst disaster to affect vanuatu ever as far as we know earthquakes vanuatu has relatively frequent earthquakes of the 58 m7 or greater events that occurred between 1909 and 2001 few were studied government politics the republic of vanuatu is a parliamentary democracy with a written constitution which declares that the head of the republic shall be known as the president and shall symbolise the unity of the nation the powers of the president of vanuatu who is elected for

figures at the village level it has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them one becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade or alternatively through inheritance the latter only in polynesian-influenced villages in northern vanuatu feasts are graded through the nimangki-system government and society in vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic french and english lines forming coalition governments however has proved problematic at times due to differences between english and french speakers francophone politicians like those of the union of moderate parties tend to be conservative and support neo-liberal policies as well as closer relations with france and the west the anglophone vanuaaku pati identifies as socialist and anti-colonial the supreme court consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges two or more members of this court may constitute a court of appeal magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters the legal system is based on british common law and french civil law the constitution also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of customary law foreign relations vanuatu has joined the asian development bank the world bank the international monetary fund the agence de coopration culturelle et technique la francophonie and the commonwealth of nations since 1980 australia the united kingdom france and new zealand have provided the bulk of vanuatus development aid direct aid from the uk to vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the uk to no longer focus on the pacific more recently new donors such as the millennium challenge account mca of the united states and the peoples republic of china have been providing increased amounts of aid funding and loans in 2005 the mca announced that vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support an amount of us65million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of public infrastructure in 2018 newspaper reports from australia indicated growing concern about the level of chinese investment in vanuatu with over 50 of the countrys debt of 440 million owed to china concern was focused on the possibility china would use vanuatus potential inability to repay debt as leverage to bargain for control of or peoples liberation army presence at luganville wharf china loaned and funded the 114 million redevelopment of the wharf which has already been constructed with capability to dock naval vessels vanuatu retains strong economic and cultural ties to australia the european union in particular france and uk and new zealand australia now provides the bulk of external assistance including the police force which has a paramilitary wing there is no vanuatu high commission or other vanuatu government office in britain but the british friends of vanuatu based in london provides support for vanuatu visitors to the uk and can often offer advice and contacts to persons seeking information about vanuatu or wishing to visit and welcomes new members not necessarily resident in the uk

they collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services they are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the public service commission their executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the prime minister with the advice of the minister of local government the provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and like the national government is advised in ni-vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs the provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the president of vanuatu the provinces are in turn divided into municipalities usually consisting of an individual island headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council economy the four mainstays of the economy are agriculture tourism offshore financial services and raising cattle there is substantial fishing activity although this industry does not bring in much foreign exchange exports include copra kava beef cocoa and timber and imports include machinery and equipment foodstuffs and fuels in contrast mining activity is unsubstantial although manganese mining halted in 1978 there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported the country has no known petroleum deposits a small light-industry sector caters to the local market tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15 vat on goods and services economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports vulnerability to natural disasters and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets agriculture is used for consumption as well as for export it provides a living for 65 of the population in particular production of copra and kava create substantial revenue many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange in 2007 the number of households engaged in fishing was 15758 mainly for consumption 99 and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3 the tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices including banana garlic cabbage peanuts pineapples sugarcane taro yams watermelons leaf spices
