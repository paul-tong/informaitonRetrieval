the red sea also the erythraean sea arabic is a seawater inlet of the indian ocean lying between africa and asia the connection to the ocean is in the south through the bab el mandeb strait and the gulf of aden to the north lie the sinai peninsula the gulf of aqaba and the gulf of suez leading to the suez canal the red sea is a global 200 ecoregion the sea is underlain by the red sea rift which is part of the great rift valley the red sea has a surface area of roughly 438000km 169100mi is about 2250km 1398mi long and at its widest point 355km 2206mi wide it has a maximum depth of 3040m 9970ft in the central suakin trough and an average depth of 490m 1608ft however there are also extensive shallow shelves noted for their marine life and corals the sea is the habitat of over 1000 invertebrate species and 200 soft and hard corals it is the worlds northernmost tropical sea extent the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the red sea as follows names red sea is a direct translation of the greek erythra thalassa latin mare rubrum alternatively sinus arabicus literally arabian gulf arabic translital-bar al-amar alternatively bar al-qulzum literally the sea of clysma somali badda cas and tigrinya qeyyi br the name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured trichodesmium erythraeum near the waters surface a theory favoured by some modern scholars is that the name red is referring to the direction south just as the black seas name may refer to north the basis of this theory is that some asiatic languages used colour words to refer to the cardinal directions herodotus on one occasion uses red sea and southern sea interchangeably historically it was also known to western geographers as mare mecca sea of mecca and sinus arabicus gulf of arabia some ancient geographers called the red sea the arabian gulf or gulf of arabia the association of the red sea with the biblical account of the israelites crossing the red sea is ancient and was made explicit in the septuagint translation of the book of exodus from hebrew to koine greek in approximately the third century bc in that version the yam suph hebrew litsea of reeds is translated as erythra thalassa red sea the red sea is one of four seas named in english after common color terms the others being the black sea the white sea and the yellow sea the direct rendition of the greek erythra thalassa in latin as mare erythraeum refers to the north-western part of the indian ocean and also to a region on mars history ancient era the earliest known exploration of the red sea was conducted by ancient egyptians as they attempted to establish commercial routes to punt one such expedition took place around 2500 bc and another around 1500 bc by hatshepsut both involved long voyages down the red sea historically scholars argued whether these trips were possible the biblical book of exodus tells the account of the israelites crossing of a body of water which the hebrew text calls yam suph hebrew yam suph was traditionally identified as the red sea rabbi saadia gaon 882942 in his judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch identifies the crossing place of the red sea as baar al-qulzum meaning the gulf of suez in the 6th century bc darius the great of persia sent reconnaissance missions to the red sea improving and extending navigation by locating many hazardous rocks and currents a canal was built between the nile and the northern end of the red sea at suez in the late 4th century bc alexander the great sent greek naval expeditions down the red sea to the indian ocean greek navigators continued to explore and compile data on the red sea agatharchides collected information about the sea in the 2nd century bc the periplus of the erythraean sea periplus of the red sea a greek periplus written by an unknown author around the 1st century ad contains a detailed description of the red seas ports and sea routes the periplus also describes how hippalus first discovered the direct route from the red sea to india the red sea was favored for roman trade with india starting with the reign of augustus when the roman empire gained control over the mediterranean egypt and the northern red sea the route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the romans from indian ports goods from china were introduced to the roman world contact between rome and china depended on the red sea but the route was broken by the aksumite empire around the 3rd century ad middle ages and modern era during the middle ages the red sea was an important part of the spice trade route in 1513 trying to secure that channel to portugal afonso de albuquerque laid siege to aden but was forced to retreat they cruised the red sea inside the bab al-mandab as the first european fleet to have sailed these waters in 1798 france ordered general napoleon to invade egypt and take control of the red sea although he failed in his mission the engineer jean-baptiste lepre who took part in it revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the pharaohs several canals were built in ancient times from the nile to the red sea along or near the line of the present sweet water canal but none lasted for long the suez canal was opened in november 1869 at the time the british french and italians shared the trading posts but these were gradually dismantled following the first world war after the second world war the americans and soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified however the six-day war culminated in the closure of the suez canal from 1967 to 1975 today in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the red sea the suez canal has never recovered its supremacy over the cape route which is believed to be less vulnerable to piracy oceanography the red sea is between arid land desert and semi-desert reef systems are better developed along the red sea mainly because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern the red sea water mass-exchanges its water with the arabian sea indian ocean via the gulf of aden these physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation in the north and relatively hot water in the south the climate of the red sea is the result of two monsoon seasons a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world the average surface water temperature of the red sea during the summer is about 26c 79f in the north and 30c 86f in the south with only about 2c 36f variation during the winter months the overall average water temperature is 22c 72f temperature and visibility remain good to around 200m 656ft the sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents the rainfall over the red sea and its coasts is extremely low averaging 006m 236in per year the rain is mostly short showers often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust storms the scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the red sea result in excess evaporation as high as 205cm 81in per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation a recent underwater expedition to the red sea offshore from sudan and eritrea found surface water temperatures 28c 82f in winter and up to 34c 93f in the summer but despite that extreme heat the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of coral bleaching with only 9 infected by thalassomonas loyana the white plague agent favia favus coral there harbours a virus ba3 which kills t loyana plans are afoot to use samples of these corals apparently heat-adapted commensal algae to salvage bleached coral elsewhere salinity the red sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world owing to high evaporation salinity ranges from between 36 in the southern part because of the effect of the gulf of aden water and 41 in the northern part owing mainly to the gulf of suez water and the high evaporation the average salinity is 40 average salinity for the worlds seawater is 35 on the practical salinity scale or psu that translates to 35 of actual dissolved salts the salinity of the red sea is greater than the world average by approximately 5 this is due to several factors high rate of evaporation and very little precipitation lack of significant rivers or streams draining into the sea limited connection with the indian ocean which has lower water salinity tidal range in general tide ranges between 06m 20ft in the north near the mouth of the gulf of suez and 09m 30ft in the south near the gulf of aden but it fluctuates between 020m 066ft and 030m 098ft away from the nodal point the central red sea jeddah area is therefore almost tideless and as such the annual water level changes are more significant because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal sabkhas as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than flooding the sabkhas through a network of channels however south of jeddah in the shoiaba area the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as 3km 2mi whereas north of jeddah in the al-kharrar area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as 2km 12mi the prevailing north and northeast winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas especially during storms winter mean sea level is 05m 16ft higher than in summer tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 12ms 365fts coral reefs in the red sea are near egypt eritrea israel saudi arabia and sudan current detailed information regarding current data is lacking partially because the currents are weak and both spatially and temporally variable the variation of temporal and spatial currents is as low as 05m 16ft and are governed all by wind during the summer nw winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 1520cms 68ins whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the gulf of aden into the red sea the net value of the latter predominates resulting in an overall drift to the north end of the red sea generally the velocity of the tidal current is between 5060cms 20236ins with a maximum of 1ms 33fts at the mouth of the al-kharrar lagoon however the range of the north-northeast current along the saudi coast is 829cms 3114ins wind regime the north part of the red sea is dominated by persistent north-west winds with speeds ranging between 7kmh 43mph and 12kmh 75mph the rest of the red sea and the gulf of aden are subjected to regular and seasonally reversible winds the wind regime is characterized by seasonal and regional variations in speed and direction with average speed generally increasing northward wind is the driving force in the red sea to transport material as suspension or as bedload wind-induced currents play an important role in the red sea in resuspending bottom sediments and transferring materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition wind-generated current measurement is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds geology the red sea was formed by the arabian peninsula being split from the horn of africa by movement of the red sea rift this split started in the eocene and accelerated during the oligocene the sea is still widening in 2005 following a three-week period of tectonic activity it had grown by 8m and it is considered that it will become an ocean in time as proposed in the model of john tuzo wilson in 1949 a deep water survey reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the red sea later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot 60c 140f saline brines and associated metalliferous muds the hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor rift lake asal in djibouti is eligible as an experimental site to study the evolution of the deep hot brines of the red sea indeed by observing the strontium isotope composition of the red sea brines it is easy to deduce how these salt waters found at the bottom of the red sea could have evolved in a similar way to lake asal which ideally represents their compositional extreme the high salinity of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms sometime during the tertiary period the bab el mandeb closed and the red sea evaporated to an empty hot dry salt-floored sink effects causing this would have been a race between the red sea widening and perim island erupting filling the bab el mandeb with lava the lowering of world sea level during the ice ages because of much water being locked up in the ice caps a number of volcanic islands rise from the center of the sea most are dormant however in 2007 jabal al-tair island in the bab el mandeb strait erupted violently two new islands were formed in 2011 and 2013 in the zubair archipelago a small chain of islands owned by yemen the first island sholan island emerged in an eruption in december 2011 the second island jadid emerged in september 2013 the durwara 2 field was discovered in 1963 while the suakin 1 field and the bashayer 1a field were discovered in 1976 on the egyptian side of the red sea the barqan field was discovered in 1969 and the midyan field in 1992 both within the midyan basin on the saudi arabian side of the red sea the 20 m thick middle miocene maqna formation is an oil source rock in the basin oil seeps occur near the farasan islands the dahlak archipelago along the coast of eritrea and in the southeastern red sea along the coasts of saudi arabia and yemen mineral resources in terms of mineral resources the major constituents of the red sea sediments are as follows biogenic constituents volcanogenic constituents terrigenous constituents authigenic minerals evaporite minerals brine precipitate ecosystem the red sea is a rich and diverse ecosystem more than 1200 species of fish have been recorded in the red sea and around 10 of these are found nowhere else this also includes 42 species of deepwater fish the rich diversity is in part due to the 2000km 1240mi of coral reef extending along its coastline these fringing reefs are 50007000 years old and are largely formed of stony acropora and porites corals the reefs form platforms and sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders such as the blue hole red sea at dahab these coastal reefs are also visited by pelagic species of red sea fish including some of the 44 species of shark it contains 175 species of nudibranch many of which are only found in the red sea the red sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true atolls many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic ie darwinian coral reef classification schemes and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area the special biodiversity of the area is recognized by the egyptian government who set up the ras mohammed national park in 1983 the rules and regulations governing this area protect local marine life which has become a major draw for diving enthusiasts divers and snorkellers should be aware that although most red sea species are innocuous a few are hazardous to humans see red sea species hazardous to humans other marine habitats include sea grass beds salt pans mangroves and salt marshes desalination plants there is extensive demand for desalinated water to meet the needs of the population and the industries along the red sea there are at least 18 desalination plants along the red sea coast of saudi arabia which discharge warm brine and treatment chemicals chlorine and anti-scalants that bleach and kill corals and cause diseases in the fish this is only localized but it may intensify with time and profoundly impact the fishing industry the water from the red sea is also used by oil refineries and cement factories for cooling used water drained back into the coastal zones may harm the nearshore environment of the red sea security the red sea is part of the sea roads between europe the persian gulf and east asia and as such has heavy shipping traffic government-related

reef rocky island in egypt and less known sites in sudan such as sanganeb abington angarosh and shaab rumi the red sea became a popular destination for diving after the expeditions of hans hass in the 1950s and later by jacques-yves cousteau popular tourist resorts include el gouna hurghada safaga marsa alam on the west shore of the red sea and sharm-el-sheikh dahab and taba on the egyptian side of sina as well as aqaba in jordan and eilat in israel in an area known as the red sea riviera the popular tourist beach of sharm el-sheikh was closed to all swimming in december 2010 due to several serious shark attacks including a fatality as of december 2010 scientists are investigating the attacks and have identified but not verified several possible causes including over-fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore tourist boat operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities and reports of ships throwing dead livestock overboard the seas narrowness significant depth and sharp drop-offs all combine to form a geography where large deep-water sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water yet be within a hundred meters of swimming areas tourism to the region has been threatened by occasional terrorist attacks and by incidents related to food safety standards bordering countries the red sea may be geographically divided into three sections the red sea proper and in the north the gulf of aqaba and the gulf of suez the six countries bordering the red sea proper are eastern shore saudi arabia yemen saudi arabia yemen western shore egypt sudan eritrea djibouti egypt sudan eritrea djibouti the gulf of suez is entirely bordered by egypt the gulf of aqaba borders egypt israel jordan and saudi arabia in addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering the red sea cited above areas such as somalia are sometimes also described as red sea territories this is primarily due to their proximity to and geological similarities with the nations facing the red sea andor political ties with said areas towns and cities towns and cities on the red sea coast including the coasts of the gulfs of aqaba and suez include see also
