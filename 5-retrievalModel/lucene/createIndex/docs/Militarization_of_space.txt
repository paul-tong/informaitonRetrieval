the militarisation of space is the placement and development of weaponry and military technology in outer space the early exploration of space in the mid-20th century had in part a military motivation as the united states and the soviet union used it as an opportunity to demonstrate ballistic missile technology and other technologies having the potential for military application outer space has since been used as an operating location for military spacecraft such as imaging and communications satellites and some ballistic missiles pass through outer space during their flight as yet however weapons are not known to have been stationed in space with the exception of the almaz space station and the tp-82 cosmonaut survival pistol for post-landing pre-recovery use history the cold war during the cold war the worlds two great superpowers the soviet union and the united states of america spent large proportions of their gdp on developing military technologies the drive to place objects in orbit stimulated space research and started the space race in 1957 the ussr launched the first artificial satellite sputnik 1 by the end of the 1960s both countries regularly deployed satellites reconnaissance satellites were used by militaries to take accurate pictures of their rivals military installations as time passed the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the iron curtain both the united states and the soviet union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or destroy each others satellites directed-energy weapons kamikaze-style satellites as well as orbital nuclear explosion were researched with varying levels of success spy satellites were and continue to be used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control treaties signed between the two superpowers to use spy satellites in such a manner is often referred to in treaties as national technical means of verification the superpowers developed ballistic missiles to enable them to use nuclear weaponry across great distances as rocket science developed the range of missiles increased and intercontinental ballistic missiles icbm were created which could strike virtually any target on earth in a timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days in order to cover large distances ballistic missiles are usually launched into sub-orbital spaceflight as soon as intercontinental missiles were developed military planners began programmes and strategies to counter their effectiveness usa early american efforts included the nike-zeus program project defender the sentinel program and the safeguard program the late 1950s nike-zeus programme involved firing nike nuclear missiles against oncoming icbms thus exploding nuclear warheads over the north pole this idea was soon scrapped and work began on project defender in 1958 project defender attempted to destroy soviet icbms at launch with satellite weapon systems which orbited over russia this programme proved infeasible with the technology from that era work then began on the sentinel program which used anti-ballistic missiles abm to shoot down incoming icbms in the late 1950s united states air force considered detonating an atomic bomb on the moon to display us superiority to the soviet union and the rest of the world project a119 in 1959 a feasibility study of a possible military base on the moon project horizon was conducted in 1958 a plan for a 21-airman underground air force base on the moon by 1968 was developed lunex project the safeguard program was deployed in the mid-1970s and was based on the sentinel program since the abm treaty only allowed for construction of a single abm facility to protect either the nations capital city or an icbm field the stanley r mickelsen safeguard complex was constructed near nekoma north dakota to protect the grand forks icbm facility though it was only operational as an abm facility for less than a year the perimeter acquisition radar par one of safeguards components was still operational as of 2005 one major problem with the safeguard program and past abm systems was that the interceptor missiles though state-of-the-art required nuclear warheads to destroy incoming icbms future abms will likely be more accurate and use hit-to-kill or conventional warheads to knock down incoming warheads the technology involved in such systems was shaky at best and deployment was limited by the abm treaty of 1972 in 1983 american president ronald reagan proposed the strategic defense initiative sdi a space-based system to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear missiles the plan was ridiculed by some as unrealistic and expensive and dr carol rosin nicknamed the policy star wars after the popular science-fiction movie franchise astronomer carl sagan pointed out that in order to defeat sdi the soviet union had only to build more missiles allowing them to overcome the defence by sheer force of numbers proponents of sdi said the strategy of technology would hasten the soviet unions downfall according to this doctrine communist leaders were forced to either shift large portions of their gdp to counter sdi or else watch as their expensive nuclear stockpiles were rendered obsolete united states space command usspacecom a unified command of the united states military was created in 1985 to help institutionalise the use of outer space by the united states armed forces the commander in chief of us space command cincusspacecom with headquarters at peterson air force base colorado was also the commander in chief of the bi-national us-canadian north american aerospace defense command cincnorad and for the majority of time during usspacecoms existence also the commander of the us air force major command air force space command military space operations coordinated by usspacecom proved to be very valuable for the us-led coalition in the 1991 persian gulf war the us military has relied on communications intelligence navigation missile warning and weather satellite systems in areas of conflict since the early 1990s including the balkans southwest asia and afghanistan space systems are considered indispensable providers of tactical information to us war-fighters as part of the ongoing initiative to transform the us military on 26 june 2002 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld announced that us space command would merge with usstratcom the ucp directed that unified combatant commands be capped at ten and with the formation of the new united states northern command one would have to be deactivated in order to maintain that level thus the usspacecom merger into usstratcom ussr the soviet union was also researching innovative ways of gaining space supremacy two of their most notable efforts were the r-36orb fractional orbital bombardment system fobs and polyus orbital weapons system the r-36orb was a soviet icbm in the 1960s that once launched would go into a low earth orbit whereupon it would de-orbit for an attack this system would approach north america over the south pole thereby striking targets from the opposite direction from that to which norad early warning systems are oriented the missile was phased out in january 1983 in compliance with the salt ii treaty the salt ii treaty 1979 prohibited the deployment of fobs systems on may 15 1987 an energia rocket flew for the first time the payload was a prototype orbital weapons platform polyus also known as polus skif-dm or 17f19dm the final version of which according to some reports could be armed with nuclear space mines and defensive cannon the polyus weapons platform was designed to defend itself against anti-satellite weapons with recoilless cannon it was also equipped with a sensor blinding laser to confuse approaching weapons and could launch test targets to validate the fire control system the attempt to place the satellite into orbit failed post-cold war as the cold war ended with the implosion of the soviet union the space race between the two superpowers ended the united states of america was left as the only superpower on earth with a large concentration of the worlds wealth and technological advancement despite the united states new status in the world the monopoly of space militarisation is in no way certain countries such as china japan and india have begun their own space programmes while the european union collectively works to create satellite systems to rival those of the united states the ussr space forces were established as the ministry of defense space units in 1982 in 1991 the soviet union disintegrated the russian armed forces were established on 7 may 1992 enabling the creation of russian space forces later that year on 10 august in july 1997 the space force was dissolved as a separate service arm and incorporated to the strategic rocket forces along with the space missile defense forces which previously were part of the troops of air defense the russian space forces were officially reborn on june 1 2001 as an independent section of the russian military post cold war space militarisation seems to revolve around three types of applications the word seems is used because much of this subject matter is inconclusively verifiable due to the high level of secrecy that exists among the great powers with regard to the details of space sensing systems the first application is the continuing development of spy or reconnaissance satellites which began in the cold war era but has progressed significantly since that time spy satellites perform a variety of missions such as high resolution photography imint communications eavesdropping sigint and covert communications humint these tasks are performed on a regular basis both during peacetime and war operations satellites are also used by the nuclear states to provide early warning of missile launches locate nuclear detonations and detect preparations for otherwise clandestine or surprise nuclear tests at least those tests or preparations carried out above-ground this was the case when in 1998 india and pakistan both conducted a series of nuclear tests in addition a nuclear-detection satellite of the vela type was also reported to have detected a nuclear detonation in the indian ocean in 1978 that was believed to be a south african nuclear test in what was famously called the vela incident early-warning satellites can also be used to detect tactical missile launches this capability was used during desert storm when america was able to provide advance warning to israel of iraqi ss-1 scud missile launches military satellite types of reconnaissance satellites united states lacrosseonyx mistysirconic samos quasar

radar satellites ofeq series of photo reconnaissance and radar satellites global positioning systems the second application of space militarisation currently in use is gps or global positioning system this satellitenavigationsystem is used for determining ones precise location and providing a highly accurate time reference almost anywhere on earth or in earth orbit it uses an intermediate circular orbit ico satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites the gps system was designed by and is controlled by the united states department of defense and can be used by anyone free of charge the cost of maintaining the system is approximately us400 million per year including the replacement of ageing satellites the first of 24 satellites that form the current gps constellation block ii was placed into orbit on february 14 1989 the 52nd gps satellite since the beginning in 1978 was launched november 6 2004 aboard a delta ii rocket the primary military purposes are to allow improved command and control of forces through improved location awareness and to facilitate accurate targeting of smart bombs cruise missiles or other munitions the satellites also carry nuclear detonation detectors which form a major portion of the united states nuclear detonation detection system european concern about the level of control over the gps network and commercial issues has resulted in the planned galileo positioning system russia already operates an independent system called glonass global navigation system the system operates with 24 satellites that are deployed in 3 orbital planes as opposed to the 4 gps is deployed in the chinese beidou system provides china a similar regional not global navigation capability india is currently developing its own regional satellite navigation system the indian regional navigational satellite system military communication systems the third current application of militarisation of space can be demonstrated by the emerging military doctrine of network-centric warfare network-centric warfare relies heavily on the use of high speed communications which allows all soldiers and branches of the military to view the battlefield in real-time real-time technology improves the situational awareness of all of the militarys assets and commanders in a given theatre for example a soldier in the battle zone can access satellite imagery of enemy positions two blocks away and if necessary e-mail the coordinates to a bomber or weapon platform hovering overhead while the commander hundreds of miles away watches as the events unfold on a monitor this high-speed communication is facilitated by a separate internet created by the military for the military communication satellites hold this system together by creating an informational grid over the given theatre of operations the department of defense is currently working to establish a global information grid to connect all military units and branches into a computerised network in order to share information and create a more efficient military military spaceplanes it was revealed that soviet officials were concerned that the us space shuttle program had such military objectives such as to make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on moscow and these concerns were part of the motivation behind pursuing their own buran programme the nasa uncrewed spaceplane project x-37 was transferred to the us department of defense in 2004 it is unclear what its military mission would be the x-37 is akin to a space version of unmanned aerial vehicle weapons in space space weapons are weapons used in space warfare they include weapons that can attack space systems in orbit ie anti-satellite weapons attack targets on the earth from space or disable missiles travelling through space in the course of the militarisation of space such weapons were developed mainly by the contesting superpowers during the cold war and some remain under development today space weapons are also a central theme in military science fiction and sci-fi video games terrestrial-type weapons in space the soviet space station salyut 3 was fitted with a 23mm cannon which was successfully test fired at target satellites at ranges from 500 to 3000 metres 1600 to 9800ft as of 2008 it was reported that russian cosmonauts have regularly carried the tp-82 cosmonaut survival pistol on soyuz spacecraft as part of the emergency landing survival kit the intent of the weapon is to protect cosmonauts from wild animals in the event of an off-course wilderness landing the specially designed gun is capable of firing bullets shotgun shells or flares space warfare space warfare is combat that takes place in outer space ie outside the atmosphere technically as a distinct classification it refers to battles where the targets themselves are in space space warfare therefore includes ground-to-space warfare such as attacking satellites from the earth as well as space-to-space warfare such as satellites attacking satellites it does not include the use of satellites for espionage surveillance or military communications however useful those activities might be it does not technically include space-to-ground warfare where orbital objects attack ground sea or air targets directly but the public and media frequently use the term to include any conflict which includes space as a theatre of operations regardless of the intended target for example a rapid delivery system in which troops are deployed from orbit might be described as space warfare even though the military uses the term as described above a film was produced by the us military in the early 1960s called space and national security which depicted space warfare from 1985 to 2002 there was a united states space command which in 2002 merged with the united states strategic command there is a russian space force which was established on august 10 1992 and which became an independent section of the russian military on december 1 2001 only a few incidents of space warfare have occurred in world history and all were training missions as opposed to actions against real opposing forces in the mid-1980s a usaf pilot in an f-15 successfully shot down the p78-1 a communications satellite in a 345-mile 555km orbit in 2007 the peoples republic of china used a missile system to destroy one of its obsolete satellites see 2007 chinese anti-satellite missile test and in 2008 the united states similarly destroyed its malfunctioning satellite usa 193 to date there have been no human casualties resulting from conflict in space nor has any ground target been successfully neutralised from orbit international treaties governing space limit or regulate conflicts in space and limit the installation of weapon systems especially nuclear weapons space treaties treaties are agreed to when all parties perceive a benefit from becoming a signatory participant in the treaty as mutually assured destruction mad became the deterrent strategy between the two superpowers in the cold war many countries worked together to avoid extending the threat of nuclear weapons to space based launchers outer space treaty the outer space treaty was considered by the legal subcommittee in 1966 later that year agreement was reached in the general assembly the treaty included the following principles the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all states outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty by means of use or occupation or by any other means states shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind states shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental activities states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects and states shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies in summary the treaty initiated the banning of signatories placing of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in orbit of earth installing them on the moon or any other celestial body or to otherwise station them in outer space the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union signed the treaty and it entered into effect on october 10 1967 as of january 1 2005 98 states have ratified and an additional 27 have signed the outer space treaty note that this treaty does not ban the placement of weapons in space in general only nuclear weapons and wmd space preservation treaty the space preservation treaty was a proposed 2006 un general assembly resolution against all space weapons only the united states of america voted against the treaty with israel abstaining in february 2008 china and russia together submitted a draft to the un known as the treaty on prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects ppwt the us opposed the draft treaty due to security concerns over its space assets despite the treaty explicitly affirming a states inherent right of self-defence on december 4 2014 the general assembly of the un passed two resolutions on preventing an arms race in outer space the first resolution prevention of an arms race in outer space calls on all states in particular those with major space capabilities to contribute actively to the peaceful use of outer space prevent an arms race there and refrain from actions contrary to that objective there were 178 countries that voted in favour to none against with 2 abstentions israel united states the second resolution no first placement of weapons in outer space which emphasises the prevention of an arms race in space and that other measures could contribute to ensuring that weapons were not placed in outer space 126 countries voted in favour to 4 against georgia israel ukraine united states with 46 abstentions eu member states abstained on the resolution national missile defense nmd with the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war defence spending was reduced and space research was chiefly focused on peaceful research american military research is focused on a more modest goal of preventing the united states from being subject to nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism by a rogue state on 16 december 2002 us president george w bush signed national security presidential directive which outlined a plan to begin deployment of operational ballistic missile defence systems by 2004 the following day the us formally requested from the uk and denmark use of facilities in raf fylingdales england and thule greenland respectively as a part of the nmd program the administration continued to push the programme despite highly publicised but not unexpected trial-and-error technical failures during development and over the objections of some scientists who opposed it the projected cost of the programme for the years 2004 to 2009 was 53 billion us dollars making it the largest single line in the pentagons budget missile defence does not station weapons in space but is designed to intercept incoming warheads at a very high altitude which requires the interceptor to travel into space to achieve the intercept these missiles are both land-based and sea-based see also project a119 fractional orbital bombardment gravity tractor kinetic bombardment vryan programme anti-satellite weapon
