the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to space science space science encompasses all of the scientific disciplines that involve space exploration and study natural phenomena and physical bodies occurring in outer space such as space medicine and astrobiology the following outline is an overview of and topical guide to space science branches of space sciences astronomy outline of astronomy fields of astronomy defined by approach observational astronomy observatories on the ground as well as space observatories take measurements of celestial entities and phenomena astrometry studies the position and movements of celestial objects amateur astronomy theoretical astronomy mathematical modelling of celestial entities and phenomena fields of astronomy defined by scope astrophysics study of the physics of the universe of extraterrestrial objects and interstitial spaces space plasma physics orbital mechanics or astrodynamics which also has applications to spacecraft stellar astronomy the study of stars solar astronomy the study of our sun planetary science the study of planets especially those other than earth planetary geology galactic astronomy the study of our milky way galaxy extragalactic astronomy the study of the larger universe beyond the milky way physical cosmology the study of the universe as a whole outline of astronomy
