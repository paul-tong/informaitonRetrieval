a molecular cloud sometimes called a stellar nursery if star formation is occurring within is a type of interstellar cloud the density and size of which permit the formation of molecules most commonly molecular hydrogen h2 this is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium that contain predominantly ionized gas molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of h2 is carbon monoxide co the ratio between co luminosity and h2 mass is thought to be constant although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies within molecular clouds are regions with higher density where lots of dust and gas cores reside called clumps these clumps are the beginning of star formation if gravity can overcome the high density and force the dust and gas to collapse occurrence within the milky way molecular gas clouds account for less than one percent of the volume of the interstellar medium ism yet it is also the densest part of the medium comprising roughly half of the total gas mass interior to the suns galactic orbit the bulk of the molecular gas is contained in a ring between 35 and 75 kiloparsecs 11000 and 24000 light-years from the center of the milky way the sun is about 85 kiloparsecs from the center large scale co maps of the galaxy show that the position of this gas correlates with the spiral arms of the galaxy that molecular gas occurs predominantly in the spiral arms suggests that molecular clouds must form and dissociate on a timescale shorter than 10 million yearsthe time it takes for material to pass through the arm region vertically to the plane of the galaxy the molecular gas inhabits the narrow midplane of the galactic disc with a characteristic scale height z of approximately 50 to 75 parsecs much thinner than the warm atomic z from 130 to 400parsecs and warm ionized z around 1000parsecs gaseous components of the ism the exception to the ionized-gas distribution are h ii regions which are bubbles of hot ionized gas created in molecular clouds by the intense radiation given off by young massive stars and as such they have approximately the same vertical distribution as the molecular gas this distribution of molecular gas is averaged out over large distances however the small scale distribution of the gas is highly irregular with most of it concentrated in discrete clouds and cloud complexes types of molecular cloud giant molecular clouds a vast assemblage of molecular gas with a mass of approximately 10 to 10 times the mass of the sun is called a giant molecular cloud gmc gmcs are around 15 to 600 light-years in diameter 5 to 200 parsecs whereas the average density in the solar vicinity is one particle per cubic centimetre the average density of a gmc is a hundred to a thousand times as great although the sun is much more dense than a gmc the volume of a gmc is so great that it contains much more mass than the sun the substructure of a gmc is a complex pattern of filaments sheets bubbles and irregular clumps the densest parts of the filaments and clumps are called molecular cores while the densest molecular cores are called dense molecular cores and have densities in excess of 10 to 10 particles per cubic centimeter observationally typical molecular cores are traced with co and dense molecular cores are traced with ammonia the concentration of dust within molecular cores is normally sufficient to block light from background stars so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae gmcs are so large that local ones can cover a significant fraction of a constellation thus they are often referred to by the name of that constellation eg the orion molecular cloud omc or the taurus molecular cloud tmc these local gmcs are arrayed in a ring in the neighborhood of the sun coinciding with the gould belt the most massive collection of molecular clouds in the galaxy forms an asymmetrical ring about the galactic center at a radius of 120 parsecs the largest component of this ring is the sagittarius b2 complex the sagittarius region is chemically rich and is often used as an exemplar by astronomers searching for new molecules in interstellar space small molecular clouds isolated gravitationally-bound small molecular clouds with masses less than a few hundred times that of the sun are called bok globules the densest parts of small molecular clouds are equivalent to the molecular cores found in gmcs and are often included in the same studies high-latitude diffuse molecular clouds in 1984 iras identified a new type of diffuse molecular cloud these were diffuse filamentary clouds that are visible at high galactic latitudes these clouds have a typical density of 30 particles per cubic centimeter processes star formation the formation of stars occurs exclusively within molecular clouds this is a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities because the gravitational force acting to collapse the cloud must exceed the internal pressures that are acting outward to prevent a collapse there is observed evidence that the large star-forming clouds are confined to a large degree by their own gravity like stars planets and galaxies rather than by external pressure the evidence comes from the fact that the turbulent velocities inferred from co linewidth scale in the same manner as the orbital velocity a virial relation physics the physics of molecular clouds is poorly understood and much debated their internal motions are governed by turbulence in a cold magnetized gas for which the turbulent motions are highly supersonic but comparable to the speeds of magnetic disturbances this state is thought to lose energy rapidly requiring either an overall collapse or a steady reinjection of energy at the same time the clouds are known to be disrupted by some processmost likely the effects of massive starsbefore a significant fraction of their mass has become stars molecular clouds and especially gmcs are often the home of astronomical masers see also accretion astrophysics astrochemistry atomic and molecular astrophysics cosmic
