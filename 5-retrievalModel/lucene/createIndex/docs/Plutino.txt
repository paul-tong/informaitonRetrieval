in astronomy the plutinos are a dynamical group of trans-neptunian objects in the outermost region of the solar system that orbit in 23 mean-motion resonance with neptune this means that for every two orbits a plutino makes neptune orbits three times the dwarf planet pluto is the largest member and namesake of this group plutinos are named after mythological creatures associated with the underworld plutinos form the inner part of the kuiper belt and represent about a quarter of the known kuiper belt objects they are the largest class of the resonant trans-neptunian objects also see adjunct box with hierarchical listing aside from pluto itself the first plutino 385185 1993 ro was discovered on september 16 1993 orbits origin it is thought that objects that are currently in mean orbital resonances with neptune initially followed independent heliocentric paths as neptune migrated outward early in the solar systems history see origins of the kuiper belt the bodies it approached would have been scattered during this process some of them would have been captured into resonances the 32 resonance is a low-order resonance and the strongest and most stable among all resonances this is the main reason it contains the largest number of bodies orbital characteristics while the majority of plutinos have low orbital inclinations a substantial number of them follow orbits similar to that of pluto with inclinations in the 1025 range and eccentricities around 02025 resulting in perihelia inside or close to the orbit of neptune and aphelia close to the main kuiper belts outer edge where objects have 12 resonance with neptune the orbital periods of plutinos cluster around 2473 years 15 neptunes orbital period varying by at most a few years from this value unusual plutinos include 2005 tv189 which follows the most highly inclined orbit 345 15875 1996 tp66 which has the most elliptical orbit its eccentricity is 033 with the perihelion halfway between uranus and neptune 470308 2007 jh43 following a quasi-circular orbit 2002 vx130 lying almost perfectly on the ecliptic inclination less than 15 see also the comparison with the distribution of the cubewanos long-term stability the gravitational influence of pluto is usually neglected given its small mass however the resonance width the range of semi-axes compatible with the resonance is very narrow and only a few times larger than plutos hill sphere gravitational influence consequently depending on the original eccentricity some plutinos will be driven out of the resonance by interactions with pluto numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of plutinos with an eccentricity 1030 smaller or larger than that of pluto are not stable over ga timescales orbital diagrams the motions of orcus and pluto in a rotating frame with a period equal to neptunes orbital period holding neptune stationary the motions of orcus and pluto in a rotating frame with a period equal to neptunes orbital period holding neptune stationary orbits and sizes of the larger plutinos and the reference non-plutino 2002 kx14 orbital eccentricity is represented by segments extending horizontally from perihelion to aphelion inclination is shown on the vertical axis orbits and sizes of the larger plutinos and the reference non-plutino 2002 kx14 orbital eccentricity is represented by segments extending horizontally from perihelion to aphelion inclination is shown on the vertical axis the distribution of plutinos and the reference non-plutino 2002 kx14 small inserts show histograms for the distributions of orbital inclination and eccentricity the distribution of plutinos and the reference non-plutino 2002 kx14 small inserts show histograms for the distributions of orbital inclination and eccentricity brightest objects the plutinos brighter than hv6 include david jewitt on plutinos minor planet center list of tnos mpc list of distant minor planets astronomy portal
