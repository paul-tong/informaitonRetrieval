dido dado dy-doh ancient greek latin pronunciationdido was according to ancient greek and roman sources the founder and first queen of carthage she is primarily known from the account given by the roman poet virgil in his epic aeneid in some sources she is also known as elissa ils ee-liss- name many names in the legend of dido are of punic origin which suggests that the first greek authors who mention this story have taken up phoenician accounts one suggestion is that dido is an epithet from the same semitic root as david which means beloved others state did means the wanderer according to marie-pierre nol elishatelisha is a name repeatedly attested on punic votives it is composed of the punic reflex of il- god the remote phoenician creator god el also a name for god in judaism and issa which could be either i means fire or another word for woman other works state it is the feminine form of el in greek it appears as theioss which translates lissa el becoming theos chronology this understanding of the chronology related to dido and her company resulted in the following dates for dido and her immediate relations as derived from f m cross and wm h barnes baal-eser ii bal-mazzer ii 846-841 bc mattan i 840-832 bc 839 bc dido was born in tyre 831 bc pygmalion begins to reign 825 bc dido flees tyre in 7th year of pygmalion after the death of acerbas 825 bc and possibly some time thereafter dido and companions on cyprus between 825 bc and 814 bc tyrians build settlement on island of cothon 814 bc dido founds carthage on mainland 785 bc death of pygmalion 759 bc dido died in carthage early accounts the person of dido can be traced to references by roman historians to lost writings of timaeus of tauromenium in sicily c356260 bc historians gave various dates both for the foundation of carthage and the foundation of rome appian in the beginning of his punic wars claims that carthage was founded by a certain zorus and carchedon but zorus looks like an alternative transliteration of the city name tyre and carchedon is just the greek form of carthage timaeus made carchedons wife elissa the sister of king pygmalion of tyre archaeological evidence of settlement on the site of carthage before the last quarter of the 8th century bc has yet to be found paucity of material for this period may be explained by rejection of the greek dark age theory that the city is named qart-hadasht or new city at least indicates it was a colony the only surviving full account before virgils treatment is that of virgils contemporary gnaeus pompeius trogus in his philippic histories as rendered in a digest or epitome made by junianus justinus in the 3rd century ad justin quoting or paraphrasing trogus states 1846 a king of tyre whom justin does not name made his very beautiful daughter dido and son pygmalion his joint heirs but on his death the people took pygmalion alone as their ruler though pygmalion was yet still a boy dido married acerbas her uncle who as priest of heraclesthat is melqartwas second in power to king pygmalion acerbas sicharbas zacherbas can be equated with the zikarbaal king of byblos mentioned in the egyptian tale of wenamon rumor told that acerbas had much wealth secretly buried and king pygmalion had acerbas murdered in hopes of gaining this wealth dido desiring to escape tyre expressed a wish to move into pygmalions palace but then ordered the attendants whom pygmalion sent to aid in the move to throw all acerbas bags of gold into the sea apparently as an offering to his spirit in fact these bags contained only sand dido then persuaded the attendants to join her in flight to another land rather than face pygmalions anger when he discovered what had supposedly become of acerbas wealth some senators also joined her in her flight the party arrived at cyprus where the priest of jupiter joined the expedition there the exiles also seized about eighty young women who were prostituting themselves on the shore in order to provide wives for the men in the party eventually dido and her followers arrived on the coast of north africa where dido asked the berber king iarbas for a small bit of land for a temporary refuge until she could continue her journeying only as much land as could be encompassed by an oxhide they agreed dido cut the oxhide into fine strips so that she had enough to encircle an entire nearby hill which was therefore afterwards named byrsa hide this event is commemorated in modern mathematics the isoperimetric problem of enclosing the maximum area within a fixed boundary is often called the dido problem in modern calculus of variations that would become their new home many of the local berbers joined the settlement and both berbers and envoys from the nearby phoenician city of utica urged the building of a city in digging the foundations an oxs head was found indicating a city that would be wealthy but subject to others accordingly another area of the hill was dug instead where a horses head was found indicating that the city would be powerful in war but when the new city of carthage had been established and become prosperous iarbas a native king of the maxitani or mauritani manuscripts differ demanded dido for his wife or he would make war on carthage didos envoys fearing iarbas told dido only that iarbas terms for peace were that someone from carthage must dwell permanently with him to teach phoenician ways and they added that of course no carthaginian would agree to dwell with such savages dido condemned any who would feel that way when they should indeed give their lives for the city if necessary didos envoys then explained that iarbas had specifically requested dido as wife dido was trapped by her words still she preferred to stay faithful to her first husband and after creating a ceremonial funeral pyre and sacrificing many victims to his spirit in pretense that this was a final honoring of her first husband in preparation for marriage to iarbas dido ascended the pyre announced that she would go to her husband as they desired and then slew herself with her sword after this self-sacrifice dido was deified and was worshipped as long as carthage endured in this account the foundation of carthage occurred 72 years before the foundation of rome servius in his commentary on virgils aeneid gives sicharbas as the name of didos husband in early tradition historicity and dating the oxhide story which explains the name of the hill must be of greek origin since byrsa means oxhide in greek not in punic the name of the hill in punic was probably just a derivation from semitic brt fortified place but that does not prevent other details in the story from being carthaginian tradition though still not necessarily historical michael grant in roman myths 1973 claims but others conjecture that dido was indeed historical as described in the following accounts it is not known who first combined the story of dido with the tradition that connected aeneas either with rome or with earlier settlements from which rome traced its origin a fragment of an epic poem by gnaeus naevius who died at utica in 201 bc includes a passage which might or might not be part of a conversation between aeneas and dido servius in his commentary 4682 54 cites varro 1st century bc for a version in which didos sister anna killed herself for love of aeneas evidence for the historicity of dido which is a question independent of whether or not she ever met aeneas can be associated with evidence for the historicity of others in her family such as her brother pygmalion and their grandfather balazeros both of these kings are mentioned as well as dido in the list of tyrian kings given in menander of ephesuss list of the kings of tyre as preserved in josephuss against apion i18 josephus ends his quotation of menander with the sentence now in the seventh year of his pygmalions reign his sister fled away from him and built the city of carthage in libya the nora stone found on sardinia has been interpreted by frank moore cross as naming pygmalion as the king of the general who was using the stone to record his victory over the local populace on paleographic grounds the stone is dated to the 9th century bc crosss translation with a longer discussion of the nora stone is found in the pygmalion article if crosss interpretation is correct this presents inscriptional evidence substantiating the existence of a 9th-century-bc king of tyre named in greek pygmalion several scholars have identified baali-maanzer the king of tyre who gave tribute to shalmaneser iii in 841 bc with baal-azor phoenician form of the name or baal-eserbalazeros greek form of the name didos grandfather this lends credibility to the account in josephusmenander that names the kings of tyre from abibaal and hiram i down to the time of pygmalion and dido another possible reference to balazeros is found in the aeneid it was a common ancient practice of using the hypocoristicon or shortened form of the name that included only the divine element so that the belus that virgil names as the father of dido in the aeneid may be a reference to her grandfather baal-eser iibalazeros even more important than the inscriptional and literary references supporting the historicity of pygmalion and dido are chronological considerations that give something of a mathematical demonstration of the veracity of the major feature of the pygmaliondido saga namely the flight of dido from tyre in pygmalions seventh year and her eventual founding of the city of carthage classical authors give two dates for the founding of carthage the first is that of pompeius trogus mentioned above that says this took place 72 years before the foundation of rome at least as early as the 1st century bc and then later the date most commonly used by roman writers for the founding of rome was 753 bc this would place didos flight in 753 72 825 bc another tradition that of the greek historian timaeus c 345260 bc gives 814 bc for the founding of carthage traditionally most modern scholars have preferred the 814 date however the publication of the shalmaneser text mentioning tribute from baal-eser ii of tyre in 841 bc caused a re-examination of this question since the best texts of menanderjosephus only allow 22 years from the accession of baal-eserbalazeros until the seventh year of pygmalion and measuring back from 814 bc would not allow any overlap of balazeros with the 841 tribute to shalmaneser with the 825 date for the seventh year of pygmalion however balazeross last year would coincide with 841 bc the year of the tribute additional evidence in favor of the 825 date is found in the statement of menander repeated by josephus as corroborated from tyrian court records against apion i1718 that didos flight or the founding of carthage occurred 143 years and eight months after hiram of tyre sent assistance to solomon for the building of the temple using the 825 date this tyrian record would then date the start of temple construction in 969 or 968 bc in agreement with the statement in 1 kings 61 that temple construction began in solomons fourth regnal year solomons fourth year can be calculated as starting in the fall of 968 bc when using the widely accepted date of 931930 bc for the division of the kingdom after the death of solomon these chronological considerations therefore definitely favor the 825 date over the 814 date for didos departure from tyre more than that the agreement of this date with the timing of the tribute to shalmaneser and the year when construction of the first temple began provide evidence for the essential historicity of at least the existence of pygmalion and dido as well as their rift in 825 bc that eventually led to the founding of carthage according to j m peuela the difference in the two dates for the foundation of carthage has an explanation if we understand that dido fled tyre in 825 bc but eleven years elapsed before she was given permission by the original inhabitants to build a city on the mainland years marked by conflict in which the tyrians first built a small city on an island in the harbor additional information about didos activities after leaving tyre are found in the pygmalion article along with a summary of later scholars who have accepted peuelas thesis if chronological considerations thus help to establish the basic historicity of dido they also serve to refute the idea that she could have had any liaison with aeneas aeneas fought in the trojan war which is conventionally dated anywhere from the 14th to the 12th centuries bc far too early for aeneas to have been alive in the time of dido even with the date of 864 bc that historical revisionist david rohl gives for the end of the trojan war aeneas would have been about 77 years old when dido fled tyre in 825 bc and 88 when she began to build carthage in 814 following peuelas reconstruction hardly consistent with the romantic intrigues between dido and aeneas imagined by virgil in the aeneid virgils aeneid virgils references in the aeneid generally agree with what justins epitome of trogus recorded virgil names belus as didos father this belus sometimes being called belus ii by later commentators to distinguish him from belus son of poseidon and libya in earlier greek mythology if the story of dido has a factual basis and is synchronized properly with history then this belus should stand for mattan i father of the historical pygmalion virgil 1343f adds that the marriage between dido and sychaeus as virgil calls didos husband occurred while her father was still alive pygmalion slew sychaeus secretly due to his wealth and sychaeus appeared to dido in a dream in which he told the truth about his death urged her to flee the country and revealed to her where his gold was buried she left with those who hated or feared pygmalion none of these details contradicts justins epitome but virgil very much changes the import and many details of the story when he brings aeneas and his followers to carthage 1657f dido and aeneas fall in love by the management of juno and venus acting in concert though for different reasons 4198f when the rumour of the love affair comes to king iarbas the gaetulian a son of jupiter ammon by a raped garamantian nymph iarbas prays to his father blaming dido who has scorned marriage with him yet now takes aeneas into the country as her lord 4222f jupiter dispatches mercury to send aeneas on his way and the pious aeneas sadly obeys mercury tells aeneas of all the promising italian lands and orders aeneas to get his fleet ready 4450f dido can no longer bear to live 4474 she has her sister anna build her a pyre under the pretence of burning all that reminded her of aeneas including weapons and clothes that aeneas had left behind and what she calls their bridal bed though according to aeneas they were never officially married 4584f when dido sees aeneas fleet leaving she curses him and his trojans and proclaims endless hate between carthage and the descendants of troy foreshadowing the punic wars 4642 dido ascends the pyre lies again on the couch which she had shared with aeneas and then falls on a sword that aeneas had given her 4666 those watching let out a cry anna rushes in and embraces her dying sister juno sends iris from heaven to release didos spirit from her body 51 from their ships aeneas and his crew see the glow of didos burning funeral pyre and can only guess what has happened at least two scholars have argued that the inclusion of the pyre as part of didos suicideotherwise unattested in epic and tragedyalludes to the self-immolation that took the life of carthages last queen or the wife of its general hasdrubal the boetharch in 146 bc 6450f during his journey in the underworld aeneas meets dido and tries to excuse himself but dido does not deign to look at him instead she turns away from aeneas to a grove where her former husband sychaeus waits virgil has included most of the motifs from the original iarbas who desires dido against her will a deceitful explanation for the building of the pyre and didos final suicide in both versions dido is loyal to her original husband in the end but whereas the earlier elissa remained always loyal to her husbands memory virgils dido dies as a tortured and repentant woman who has fallen away from that loyalty virgil consistently uses the form dido as nominative but derivates of elissa for the oblique cases later roman tradition letter 7 of ovids heroides is a feigned letter from dido to aeneas written just before she ascends the pyre the situation is as in virgils aeneid in ovids fasti 3545f ovid introduced a kind of sequel involving aeneas and didos sister anna see anna perenna the barcids the family to which hannibal belonged claimed descent from a younger brother of dido according to silius italicus in his punica 1717 the augustan history tyrrani triginta 27 30 claims that zenobia queen of palmyra in the late third century was descended from cleopatra dido and semiramis continuing tradition in the divine comedy dante sees the shade of dido in the second circle of hell where she is condemned on account of her consuming lust to be blasted for eternity in a fierce whirlwind this legend inspired the renaissance drama dido queen of carthage by christopher marlowe also from the 17th century is a ballad inspired by the relationship between dido and aeneas the ballad often printed on a broadside is called the wandering prince of troy and it alters the end of the relationship between the two lovers rethinking didos final sentiment for aeneas and rewriting aeneass visit to the underworld as didos choice to haunt him the story of dido and aeneas remained popular throughout the post-renaissance era and was the basis for many operas including 1641 la didone by francesco cavalli 1656 la didone by andrea mattioli 1689 dido and aeneas by henry purcell 1693 didon by henry desmarets 1707 dido knigin von carthago by christoph graupner 1724 didone abbandonata by domenico sarro 1740 didone abbandonata by

by saverio mercadante 1860 les troyens by hector berlioz 2007 aeneas and dido by james rolfe composer william shakespeare refers to dido twelve times in his plays four times in the tempest albeit all in one dialogue twice in titus andronicus and also in henry vi part 2 antony and cleopatra hamlet romeo and juliet a midsummer nights dream and most famously in the merchant of venice in lorenzos and jessicas mutual wooing in 1794 germany charlotte von stein wrote her own drama named dido with an autobiographical element - as von stein had been forsaken by her own lover the famous goethe in a manner which she found reminiscent of aeneas even today dido appears in sid meiers strategy games civilization ii and civilization v as the leader of the carthaginian civilization although she appears alongside hannibal in the former in civilization v she speaks phoenician with a modern israeli accent in 2019 dido was made the leader of phoenicia in civilization vi gathering storm with tyre as its capital in honor of dido the asteroid 209 dido discovered in 1879 was named after her another dedication of queen dido is the mount dido in antarctica remembrance of the story of the bulls hide and the foundation of carthage is preserved in mathematics in connection with the isoperimetric problem which is sometimes called didos problem and similarly the isoperimetric theorem is sometimes called didos theorem it is sometimes stated in such discussion that dido caused her thong to be placed as a half circle touching the sea coast at each end which would add greatly to the perimeter but the sources mention the thong only and say nothing about the sea carthage was the roman republics greatest rival and enemy and virgils dido in part symbolises this even though no rome existed in her day virgils dido curses the future progeny of the trojans in italy under the fascist regime her figure was demonized perhaps not only as an anti-roman figure but because she represented together at least three other unpleasant qualities feminine virtue semitic race and north african civilization as an innocuous example when benito mussolinis regime named the streets of new quarters in rome with the
