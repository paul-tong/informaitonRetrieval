unmanned or uncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board used for unmanned spaceflight uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input they may be remote controlled remote guided or even autonomous meaning they have a pre-programmed list of operations which they will execute unless otherwise instructed many habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic features for example the space stations salyut 7 and mir and the iss module zarya were capable of remote guided station-keeping and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules the most common uncrewed spacecraft categories are robotic spacecraft uncrewed resupply spacecraft space probes and space observatories not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft for example a reflector ball is a non-robotic uncrewed spacecraft examples for a more detailed list see list of solar system probes selected lunar probes luna program ussr lunar exploration 19591976
