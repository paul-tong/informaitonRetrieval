flyby is a spacecraft concept whereby one object passes in closer proximity to another usually a spacecraft maneuver in space exploration spacecraft which are specifically designed for this purpose are known as flyby spacecraft although the term has also been used in regard to asteroid flybys of earth for example two common goals are for exploration or for a gravity assist one important subconcept of a flyby in spaceflight is the time and distance of closest approach this distance is often reported along with a time in regards to flybys in space spacecraft flyby flyby maneuvers can be conducted with a planet or non-planet object such as a comet planetary flybys have occurred with mars or earth for example list of earth flybys mars flyby an example of a comet flyby is when international cometary explorer formerly isee-3 passed about 4800 miles 7800 kilometers from the nucleus of comet giacobini-zinner in september 1985 another application of the flyby is of earths moon usually called a lunar flyby the orion em-2 mission has a mission design that would include a lunar flyby in regards to mars flybys a related concept is a mars flyby rendezvous where a spacecraft does not enter orbit but rendezvous before or after a flyby of the planet with another spacecraft mars flyby rendezvous was evaluated at nasas manned spacecraft center in the 1960s at that time nasa developed designs for a combination of a mars lander short-stay surface habitat and ascent vehicle called a mars excursion module mem the ascent stage performed the rendezvous with another spacecraft that did a flyby of mars without entering orbit or landing compared to mor a flyby rendezvous means one spacecraft does not have to orbit mars so the resources needed on a return journey to earth are not taken in and out of mars orbit for example see also mars cycler mariner iv flyby of mars in july 1965 returned more accurate atmospheric data about mars and much closer views of its surface then previously mariner 6 and mariner 7 flyby of mars in 1969 caused another breakthrough in knowledge about the planet the mariner 6 7 infrared radiometer results from he flyby showed that the atmosphere of mars was composed mostly of carbon dioxide co2 and they were also able to detect trace amounts water on the surface of mars in 2018 the twin mars cube one performed a flyby to relay communication for insight lander edl they were launched towards mars with the cruise stage carrying the insight lander both marcos reached mars and successfully relayed data during the entry descent and landing phase of insight on november 26 2018 the new horizons spacecraft was planning to flyby the kuiper belt object 2014 mu69 on new years day 2019 after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet pluto in 2015 on the night of december 31 2018 to the morning of january 1 2019 new horizons performed the most distant flyby to date of the kuiper belt minor planet 486958 2014 mu69 new horizons previously did a flyby of pluto in july 2015 and that was at about 329 au astronomical units from the sun while the new years day 2019 flyby of the kuiper object ultima thule 2014 mu69 was at 436 au cassini-huygens launched 1997 which orbited saturn from 2004-2017 performed flybys of many of saturns moons including titan cassini-huygens had its first flyby of titan in october 2004 for further examples of cassini flybys of saturns moons see timeline of cassini-huygens cassini conducted many flybys at various distances of the moons of saturn it achieved 126 flybys of titan and its final close flyby was on april 22 2017 prior to its retirement animation of the cassini spacecraft trajectory around saturn over 10 years and during this time it passed closely by many moons of saturn international cometary explorer isee-3 passed through the plasma tail of comet giacobini-zinner doing a flyby of the distance of 7800km 4800mi of the nucleus on september 11 1985 in 2010 the deep impact spacecraft on the epoxi mission did a flyby of comet hartley 2 natural flyby flyby is also commonly used to describe when for example an asteroid approaches and coasts by the earth this was also the term for when a comet did a flyby of mars in 2014 p2016 ba14 was radar imaged at distance of 22 million miles 9 lunar distances from earth in 2016 during its flyby this enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to about 1 km in diameter on december 16 2018 the short period comet 46pwirtanen had its closest approach of earth coming within 71 million miles one of its closest approaches to earth see also list of asteroid close approaches to earth space rendezvous orbital spaceflight aerobraking aerogravity assist perihelion and aphelion flight dynamics spacecraft deliberate crash landings on extraterrestrial bodies fly-in smithsonian air and space- probes and fly-by spacecraft lunar flybys
