tempel 1 official designation 9ptempel is a periodic jupiter-family comet discovered by wilhelm tempel in 1867 it completes an orbit of the sun every 55 years tempel 1 was the target of the deep impact space mission which photographed a deliberate high-speed impact upon the comet in 2005 it was re-visited by the stardust spacecraft on february 14 2011 and came back to perihelion in august 2016 discovery and orbital history tempel 1 was discovered on april 3 1867 by wilhelm tempel an astronomer working in marseille at the time of discovery it approached perihelion once every 568 years designations 9p1867 g1 and 1867 ii it was subsequently observed in 1873 9p1873 g1 1873 i 1873a and in 1879 1879 iii 1879b photographic attempts during 1898 and 1905 failed to recover the comet and astronomers surmised that it had disintegrated in fact its orbit had changed tempel 1s orbit occasionally brings it sufficiently close to jupiter to be altered with a consequent change in the comets orbital period this occurred in 1881 closest approach to jupiter of 055 au lengthening the orbital period to 65 years perihelion also changed increasing by 50 million kilometres rendering the comet far less visible from earth tempel 1 was rediscovered 13 orbits later in 1967 as 9p1967 l1 1966 vii after british astronomer brian g marsden performed precise calculations of the comets orbit that took into account jupiters perturbations marsden found that further close approaches to jupiter in 1941 041 au and 1953 077 au had decreased both the perihelion distance and the orbital period to values smaller than when the comet was initially discovered 584 and 555 years respectively these approaches moved tempel 1 into its present libration around the 12 resonance with jupiter despite an unfavorable 1967 return elizabeth roemer of the catalina observatory took several photographs initial inspection revealed nothing but in late 1968 she found a june 8 1967 exposure tempel 1 had passed perihelion in january that held the image of an 18th magnitude diffuse object very close to where marsden had predicted the comet to be a single image does not allow an orbit computation so the next return had to be awaited roemer and l m vaughn recovered the comet on january 11 1972 from steward observatory 9p1972 a1 1972 v 1972a the comet became widely observed reached a maximum brightness of magnitude 11 during may and was last seen on july 10 since that time the comet has been seen at every apparition in 1978 1978 ii 1977i 1983 1983 xi 1982j 1989 1989 i 1987e1 1994 1994 xiux 1993c 2000 and 2005 its orbital period is 5515 years physical characteristics tempel 1 is not a bright comet its brightest apparent magnitude since discovery has been 11 far below naked-eye visibility its nucleus measures 76km 49km 47mi 30mi measurements taken by the hubble space telescope in visible light and the spitzer space telescope in infrared light suggest a low albedo of only 4 a two-day rotation rate was also determined exploration deep impact space mission on 4 july 2005 at 0552 utc 0152 edt tempel 1 was deliberately struck by one component of the nasa deep impact probe one day before perihelion the impact was photographed by the other component of the probe which recorded a bright spray from the impact site the impact was also observed by earthbound and space telescopes which recorded a brightening of several magnitudes the crater that formed was not visible to deep impact due to the cloud of dust raised by the impact but was estimated to be between 100 and 250 meters in diameter and 30 meters deep the probes spectrometer instrument detected dust particles finer than human hair and discovered the presence of silicates carbonates smectite metal sulfides such as fools gold amorphous carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons water ice was detected in the ejecta the water ice came from 1 meter below the surface crust the devolatized layer around the nucleus next mission in part because the crater formed during the deep impact collision could not be imaged during the initial flyby on 3 july 2007 nasa approved the new exploration of tempel 1 or next mission the low-cost mission utilized the already existing stardust spacecraft which had studied comet wild 2 in 2004 stardust was placed into a new orbit so that it approached tempel 1 it passed at a distance of approximately 181km 112mi on february 15 2011 0442 utc this was the first time that a comet was visited twice on february 15 nasa scientists identified the crater formed by deep impact in images from stardust the crater is estimated to be 150m 490ft in diameter and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into the crater energy of impactor according to nasa the impactor delivers 19 gigajoules thats 48 tons of tnt of kinetic energy to excavate the crater this kinetic energy is generated by the combination of the mass of the impactor 370 kg 816 lbs and its velocity when it impacts 102 kms also according to nasa expected crater dimensions the energy from the impact will excavate a crater approximately 100m wide and 28m deep the geometry of the flyby allowed investigators to obtain considerably more three-dimensional information about the nucleus from stereo pairs of images than during deep impacts encounter scientists were able to quickly spot locations where an elevated flow-like formation of icy material on the comets surface receded due to sublimation between encounters close approaches comets are in unstable orbits that evolve over time due to perturbations and outgassing tempel 1 passed within 004au - or 59 million km 37 million mi - of the dwarf planet ceres on november 11 2011 then as a jupiter-family comet it will spend years interacting with the giant planet jupiter finally passing within 002au - or 30 million km 19 million mi - of mars on october 17 2183 gallery see also deep
