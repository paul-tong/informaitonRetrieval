electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles the electromagnetic force usually exhibits electromagnetic fields such as electric fields magnetic fields and light and is one of the four fundamental interactions commonly called forces in nature the other three fundamental interactions are the strong interaction the weak interaction and gravitation at high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electroweak force electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force sometimes called the lorentz force which includes both electricity and magnetism as different manifestations of the same phenomenon the electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life ordinary matter takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual atoms and molecules in matter and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force electrons are bound by the electromagnetic force to atomic nuclei and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics the electromagnetic force governs all chemical processes which arise from interactions between the electrons of neighboring atoms there are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field in classical electrodynamics electric fields are described as electric potential and electric current in faradays law magnetic fields are associated with electromagnetic induction and magnetism and maxwells equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents the theoretical implications of electromagnetism particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the medium of propagation permeability and permittivity led to the development of special relativity by albert einstein in 1905 history of the theory originally electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate forces this view changed however with the publication of james clerk maxwells 1873 a treatise on electricity and magnetism in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force there are four main effects resulting from these interactions all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments electric charges attract or repel one another with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them unlike charges attract like ones repel magnetic poles or states of polarization at individual points attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs every north pole is yoked to a south pole an electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire its direction clockwise or counter-clockwise depends on the direction of the current in the wire a current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field or a magnet is moved towards or away from it the direction of current depends on that of the movement while preparing for an evening lecture on 21 april 1820 hans christian rsted made a surprising observation as he was setting up his materials he noticed a compass needle deflected away from magnetic north when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off this deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current just as light and heat do and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism at the time of discovery rsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework however three months later he began more intensive investigations soon thereafter he published his findings proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire the cgs unit of magnetic induction oersted is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism his findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in electrodynamics they influenced french physicist andr-marie ampres developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors rsteds discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy this unification which was observed by michael faraday extended by james clerk maxwell and partially reformulated by oliver heaviside and heinrich hertz is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics it has had far-reaching consequences one of which was the understanding of the nature of light unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time light and other electromagnetic waves are at present seen as taking the form of quantized self-propagating oscillatory electromagnetic field disturbances called photons different frequencies of oscillation give rise to the different forms of electromagnetic radiation from radio waves at the lowest frequencies to visible light at intermediate frequencies to gamma rays at the highest frequencies rsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism in 1802 gian domenico romagnosi an italian legal scholar deflected a magnetic needle using a voltaic pile the factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear so if current flew across the needle or not an account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an italian newspaper but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community because romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community an earlier 1735 and often neglected connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a dr cookson the account stated a tradesman at wakefield in yorkshire having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box and having placed the box in the corner of a large room there happened a sudden storm of thunder lightning c the owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay the persons who took up the knives that lay on the nails observed that the knives took up the nails on this the whole number was tried and found to do the same and that to such a degree as to take up large nails packing needles and other iron things of considerable weight e t whittaker suggested in 1910 that this particular event was responsible for lightning to be credited with the power of magnetizing steel and it was doubtless this which led franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of leyden jars fundamental forces the electromagnetic force is one of the four known fundamental forces the other fundamental forces are the weak nuclear force which binds to all known particles in the standard model and causes certain forms of radioactive decay in particle physics though the electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature electromagnetism and the weak interaction the strong nuclear force which binds quarks to form nucleons and binds nucleons to form nuclei the gravitational force all other forces eg friction contact forces are derived from these four fundamental forces including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles the electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale with the exception of gravity roughly speaking all the forces involved in interactions between atoms can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons of the atoms electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement this includes the forces we experience in pushing or pulling ordinary material objects which result from the intermolecular forces that act between the individual molecules in our bodies and those in the objects the electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of chemical phenomena a necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons movement such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them as a collection of electrons becomes more confined their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the pauli exclusion principle the behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves classical electrodynamics in 1600 william gilbert proposed in his de magnete that electricity and magnetism while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects were distinct effects mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until benjamin franklins proposed experiments in 1752 one of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was romagnosi who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a voltaic pile deflected a nearby compass needle however the effect did not become widely known until 1820 when rsted performed a similar experiment rsteds work influenced ampre to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation a theory of electromagnetism known as classical electromagnetism was developed by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a treatise by james clerk maxwell which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light in classical electromagnetism the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as maxwells equations and the electromagnetic force is given by the lorentz force law one of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics but it is compatible with special relativity according to maxwells equations the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space this violates galilean invariance a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics one way to reconcile the two theories electromagnetism and classical mechanics is to assume the existence of a luminiferous aether through which the light propagates however subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether after important contributions of hendrik lorentz and henri poincar in 1905 albert einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism for more information see history of special relativity in addition relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin hence the term electromagnetism for more information see classical electromagnetism and special relativity and covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism extension to nonlinear phenomena the maxwell equations are linear in that a change in the sources the charges and currents results in a proportional change of the fields nonlinear dynamics can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws this is studied for example in the subject of magnetohydrodynamics which combines maxwell theory with the navierstokes equations quantities and units electromagnetic units are part of a system of electrical units based primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents the fundamental si unit being the ampere the units are ampere electric current coulomb electric charge farad capacitance henry inductance ohm resistance siemens conductance tesla magnetic flux density volt electric potential watt power weber magnetic flux in the electromagnetic cgs system electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via ampres law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity relative permeability whose value in a vacuum is unity as a consequence the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism such as maxwells equations need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses this is because there is no one-to-one correspondence between electromagnetic units in si and those in cgs as is the case for mechanical units furthermore within cgs there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units leading to different unit sub-systems including gaussian esu emu and heavisidelorentz among these choices gaussian units are the most common today and in fact the phrase cgs units is often used to refer specifically to cgs-gaussian units see also electromagnetism
