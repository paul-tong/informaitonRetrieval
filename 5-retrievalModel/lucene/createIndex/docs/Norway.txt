and the democracy index norway has one of the lowest crime rates in the world etymology norway has two official names norge in bokml and noreg in nynorsk the english name norway comes from the old english word norweg mentioned in 880 meaning northern way or way leading to the north which is how the anglo-saxons referred to the coastline of atlantic norway similar to scientific consensus about the origin of the norwegian language name the anglo-saxons of britain also referred to the kingdom of norway in 880 as normanna land there is some disagreement about whether the native name of norway originally had the same etymology as the english form according to the traditional dominant view the first component was originally norr a cognate of english north so the full name was norr vegr the way northwards referring to the sailing route along the norwegian coast and contrasting with survegar southern way from old norse sur for germany and austrvegr eastern way from austr for the baltic in the translation of orosius for alfred the name is norweg while in younger old english sources the is gone in the 10th century many norsemen settled in northern france according to the sagas in the area that was later called normandy from normann norseman or scandinavian although not a norwegian possession in france normanni or northmanni referred to people of norway sweden or denmark until around 1800 inhabitants of western norway where referred to as nordmenn northmen while inhabitants of eastern norway where referred to as austmenn eastmen according to another theory the first component was a word nr meaning narrow old english nearu or northern referring to the inner-archipelago sailing route through the land narrow way the interpretation as northern as reflected in the english and latin forms of the name would then have been due to later folk etymology this latter view originated with philologist niels halvorsen trnnes in 1847 since 2016 it as also advocated by language student and activist klaus johan myrvoll and was adopted by philology professor michael schulte the form nore is still used in placenames such as the village of nore and lake norefjorden in buskerud county and still has the same meaning among other arguments in favour of the theory it is pointed out that the word has a long vowel in skaldic poetry and is not attested with in any native norse texts or inscriptions the earliest runic attestations have the spellings nuruiak and nuriki this resurrected theory has received some pushback by other scholars on various grounds eg the uncontroversial presence of the element norr in the ethnonym norrmar norseman norwegian person modern norwegian nordmann and the adjective norrnn northern norse norwegian as well as the very early attestations of the latin and anglo-saxon forms with th in a latin manuscript of 849 the name northuagia is mentioned while a french chronicle of c 900 uses the names northwegia and norwegia when ohthere of hlogaland visited king alfred the great in england in the end of the ninth century the land was called norwegr lit northway and normanna land lit northmens land according to ohthere normanna lived along the atlantic coast the danes around skagerrak og kattegat while the smi people the fins had a nomadic lifestyle in the wide interior ohthere told alfred that he was the most northern of all norwegians presumably at senja island or closer to troms he also said that beyond the wide wilderness in norways southern part was the land of the swedes svealand the adjective norwegian recorded from c 1600 is derived from the latinisation of the name as norwegia in the adjective norwegian the old english spelling -weg has survived after norway had become christian noregr and noregi had become the most common forms but during the 15th century the newer forms noregh and norghe found in medieval icelandic manuscripts took over and have survived until the modern day history prehistory the first inhabitants were the ahrensburg culture 11th to 10th millennia bc which was a late upper paleolithic culture during the younger dryas the last period of cold at the end of the weichselian glaciation the culture is named after the village of ahrensburg 25km 1553mi north-east of hamburg in the german state of schleswig-holstein where wooden arrow shafts and clubs have been excavated the earliest traces of human occupation in norway are found along the coast where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11000 and 8000 bc the oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9500 to 6000 bc discovered in finnmark komsa culture in the north and rogaland fosna culture in the south-west however theories about two altogether different cultures the komsa culture north of the arctic circle being one and the fosna culture from trndelag to oslofjord being the other were rendered obsolete in the 1970s more recent finds along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not to different cultures coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for fishermen and hunters who may have made their way along the southern coast about 10000 bc when the interior was still covered with ice it is now thought that these so-called arctic peoples came from the south and followed the coast northward considerably later in the southern part of the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5000 bc finds from these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing peoples the implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different kinds of stone those of later periods are more skilfully made rock carvings ie petroglyphs have been found usually near hunting and fishing grounds they represent game such as deer reindeer elk bears birds seals whales and fish especially salmon and halibut all of which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples the rock carvings at alta in finnmark the largest in scandinavia were made at sea level from 4200 to 500 bc and mark the progression of the land as the sea rose after the last ice age ended bronze age between 3000 and 2500 bc new settlers corded ware culture arrived in eastern norway they were indo-european farmers who grew grain and kept cows and sheep the hunting-fishing population of the west coast was also gradually replaced by farmers though hunting and fishing remained useful secondary means of livelihood from about 1500 bc bronze was gradually introduced but the use of stone implements continued norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period the motifs of the rock carvings differ from those typical of the stone age representations of the sun animals trees weapons ships and people are all strongly stylised thousands of rock carvings from this period depict ships and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships suggest that ships and seafaring played an important role in the culture at large the depicted ships most likely represent sewn plank built canoes used for warfare fishing and trade these ship types may have their origin as far back as the neolithic period and they continue into the pre-roman iron age as exemplified by the hjortspring boat iron age little has been found dating from the early iron age the last 500 years bc the dead were cremated and their graves contain few burial goods during the first four centuries ad the people of norway were in contact with roman-occupied gaul about 70 roman bronze cauldrons often used as burial urns have been found contact with the civilised countries farther south brought a knowledge of runes the oldest known norwegian runic inscription dates from the 3rd century at this time the amount of settled area in the country increased a development that can be traced by coordinated studies of topography archaeology and place-names the oldest root names such as nes vik and b cape bay and farm are of great antiquity dating perhaps from the bronze age whereas the earliest of the groups of compound names with the suffixes vin meadow or heim settlement as in bjrgvin bergen or sheim seim usually date from the 1st century ad archaeologists first made the decision to divide the iron age of northern europe into distinct pre-roman and roman iron ages after emil vedel unearthed a number of iron age artefacts in 1866 on the island of bornholm they did not exhibit the same permeating roman influence seen in most other artefacts from the early centuries ad indicating that parts of northern europe had not yet come into contact with the romans at the beginning of the iron age migration period the destruction of the western roman empire by the germanic peoples in the 5th century is characterised by rich finds including tribal chiefs graves containing magnificent weapons and gold objects hill forts were built on precipitous rocks for defence excavation has revealed stone foundations of farmhouses 18 to 27 metres 59 to 89ft longone even 46 metres 151 feet longthe roofs of which were supported on wooden posts these houses were family homesteads where several generations lived together with people and cattle under one roof these states were based on either clans or tribes eg the horder of hordaland in western norway by the 9th century each of these small states had things local or regional assemblies for negotiating and settling disputes the thing meeting places each eventually with a hrgr open-air sanctuary or a heathen hof temple literally hill were usually situated on the oldest and best farms which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers the regional things united to form even larger units assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions in this way the lagting assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking developed the gulating had its meeting place by sognefjord and may have been the centre of an aristocratic confederation along the western fjords and islands called the gulatingslag the frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the trondheimsfjord area the earls of lade near trondheim seem to have enlarged the frostatingslag by adding the coastland from romsdalsfjord to lofoten viking age from the 8th to the 10th century the wider scandinavian region was the source of vikings the looting of the monastery at lindisfarne in northeast england in 793 by norse people has long been regarded as the event which marked the beginning of the viking age this age was characterised by expansion and emigration by viking seafarers they colonised raided and traded in all parts of europe norwegian viking explorers first discovered iceland by accident in the 9th century when heading for the faroe islands and eventually came across vinland known today as newfoundland in canada the vikings from norway were most active in the northern and western british isles and eastern north america isles according to tradition harald fairhair unified them into one in 872 after the battle of hafrsfjord in stavanger thus becoming the first king of a united norway haralds realm was mainly a south norwegian coastal state fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas many norwegians left the country to live in iceland the faroe islands greenland and parts of britain and ireland the modern-day irish cities of dublin limerick and waterford were founded by norwegian settlers norse traditions were replaced slowly by christian ones in the late 10th and early 11th centuries one of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century vikings is the treaty between the icelanders and olaf haraldsson king of norway circa 1015 to 1028 this is largely attributed to the missionary kings olav tryggvasson and st olav haakon the good was norways first christian king in the mid-10th century though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected born sometime in between 963969 olav tryggvasson set off raiding in england with 390 ships he attacked london during this raiding arriving back in norway in 995 olav landed in moster there he built a church which became the first christian church ever built in norway from moster olav sailed north to trondheim where he was proclaimed king of norway by the eyrathing in 995 feudalism never really developed in norway or sweden as it did in the rest of europe however the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character the hanseatic league forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy the league had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying the leagues monopolistic control over the economy of norway put pressure on all classes especially the peasantry to the degree that no real burgher class existed in norway civil war and peak of power from the 1040s to 1130 the country was at peace in 1130 the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws which allowed all the kings sons to rule jointly for periods there could be peace before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict the archdiocese of nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings the church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the churchs influence of the king the wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of hkon hkonsson who introduced clear law of succession from 1000 to 1300 the population increased from 150000 to 400000 resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms while in the viking age all farmers owned their own land by 1300 seventy percent of the land was owned by the king the church or the aristocracy this was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times and not being able to repay however tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs in the 13th century about twenty percent of a farmers yield went to the king church and landowners the 14th century is described as norways golden age with peace and increase in trade especially with the british islands although germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century throughout the high middle ages the king established norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives in 1349 the black death spread to norway and had within a year killed a third of the population later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400 many communities were entirely wiped out resulting in an abundance of land allowing farmers to switch to more animal husbandry the reduction in taxes weakened the kings position and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus reducing some to mere farmers high tithes to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the council of state the hanseatic league took control over norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading center in bergen in 1380 olaf haakonsson inherited both the norwegian and danish thrones creating a union between the two countries in 1397 under margaret i the kalmar union was created between the three scandinavian countries she waged war against the germans resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on norwegian goods which resulted in a rebellion however the norwegian council of state was too weak to pull out of the union margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured denmark because it had a greater population than norway and sweden combined margaret also granted trade privileges to the hanseatic merchants of lbeck in bergen in return for recognition of her right to rule and these hurt the norwegian economy the hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in bergen for generations even worse were the pirates the victual brothers who launched three devastating raids on the port the last in 1427 norway slipped ever more to the background under the oldenburg dynasty established 1448 there was one revolt under knut alvsson in 1502 norwegians had some affection for king christian ii who resided in the country for several years norway took no part in the events which led to swedish independence from denmark in the 1520s kalmar union upon the death of haakon v king of norway in 1319 magnus erikson at just three years old inherited the throne as king magnus vii of norway at the same time a movement to make magnus king of sweden proved successful and both the kings of sweden and of denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles thus with his election to the throne of sweden both sweden and norway were united under king magnus vii in 1349 the black death radically altered norway killing between 50 and 60 of its population and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline the plague left norway very poor although the death rate was comparable with the rest of europe economic recovery took much longer because of the small scattered population even before the plague the population was only about 500000 after the plague many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased however the few surviving farms tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened king magnus vii ruled norway until 1350 when his son haakon was placed on the throne as haakon vi in 1363 haakon vi married margaret the daughter of king valdemar iv of denmark upon the death of haakon vi in 1379 his son olaf iv was only 10 years old olaf had already been elected to the throne of denmark on 3 may 1376 thus upon olafs accession to the throne of norway denmark and norway entered personal union olafs mother and haakons widow queen margaret managed the foreign affairs of denmark and norway during the minority of olaf iv margaret was working toward a union of sweden with denmark and norway by having olaf elected to the swedish throne she was on the verge of achieving this goal when olaf iv suddenly died however denmark made margaret temporary ruler upon the death of olaf on 2 february 1388 norway followed suit and crowned margaret queen margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place she settled on eric of pomerania grandson of her sister thus at an all-scandinavian meeting held at kalmar erik of pomerania was crowned king of all three scandinavian countries thus royal politics resulted in personal unions between the nordic countries eventually bringing the thrones of norway denmark and sweden under the control of queen margaret when the country entered into the kalmar union union with denmark after sweden broke out of the kalmar union in 1521 norway tried to follow suit but the subsequent rebellion was defeated and norway remained in a union with denmark until 1814 a total of 434 years during the national romanticism of the 19th century this period was by some referred to as the 400-year night since all of the kingdoms royal intellectual and administrative power was centred in copenhagen in denmark in fact it was a period of great prosperity and progress for norway especially in terms of shipping and foreign trade and it also secured the countrys revival from the demographic catastrophe it suffered in the black death based on the respective natural resources denmarknorway was in fact a very good match since denmark supported norways needs for grain and food supplies and norway supplied denmark with timber metal and fish with the introduction of protestantism in 1536 the archbishopric in trondheim was dissolved and norway lost its independence and effectually became a colony of denmark the churchs incomes and possessions were instead redirected to the court in copenhagen norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of st olav at the nidaros shrine and with them much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of europe eventually restored as a kingdom albeit in legislative union with denmark in 1661 norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces bhuslen jemtland and herjedalen to sweden as the result of a number of disastrous wars with sweden in the north however its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of troms and finnmark at the expense of sweden and russia the famine of 16951696 killed roughly 10 of norways population the harvest failed in scandinavia at least nine times between 1740 and 1800 with great loss of life union with sweden after denmarknorway was attacked by the united kingdom at the battle of copenhagen it entered into an alliance with napoleon with the war leading to dire conditions and mass starvation in 1812 as the danish kingdom found itself on the losing side in 1814 it was forced under terms of the treaty of kiel to cede norway to the king of sweden while the old norwegian provinces of iceland greenland and the faroe islands remained with the danish crown norway took this opportunity to declare independence adopted a constitution based on american and french models and elected the crown prince of denmark and norway christian frederick as king on 17 may 1814 this is the famous syttende mai seventeenth of may holiday celebrated by norwegians and norwegian-americans alike syttende mai is also called norwegian constitution day norwegian opposition to the great powers decision to link norway with sweden caused the norwegianswedish war to break out as sweden tried to subdue norway by military means as swedens military was not strong enough to defeat the norwegian forces outright and norways treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war and as british and russian navies blockaded the norwegian coast the belligerents were forced to negotiate the convention of moss according to the terms of the convention christian frederik abdicated the norwegian throne and authorised the parliament of norway to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the personal union that norway was forced to accept on 4 november 1814 the parliament storting elected charles xiii of sweden as king of norway thereby establishing the union with sweden under this arrangement norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions except for the foreign service following the recession caused by the napoleonic wars economic development of norway remained slow until economic growth began around 1830 this period also saw the rise of the norwegian romantic nationalism as norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character the movement covered all branches of culture including literature henrik wergeland 18081845 bjrnstjerne bjrnson 18321910 peter christen asbjrnsen 18121845 jrgen moe 18131882 painting hans gude 18251903 adolph tidemand 18141876 music edvard grieg 18431907 and even language policy where attempts to define a native written language for norway led to todays two official written forms for norwegian bokml and nynorsk king charles iii john who came to the throne of norway and sweden in 1818 was the second king following norways break from denmark and the union with sweden charles john was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844 he protected the constitution and liberties of norway and sweden during the age of metternich as such he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age however he was ruthless in his use of paid informers the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reformespecially the norwegian national independence movement the romantic era that followed the reign of king charles iii john brought some significant social and political reforms in 1854 women won the right to inherit property in their own right just like men in 1863 the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed furthermore women were then eligible for different occupations particularly the common school teacher by mid-century norways democracy was limited by modern standards voting was limited to officials property owners leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns still norway remained a conservative society life in norway especially economic life was dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government there was no strong bourgeosie class in norway to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control of the economy thus even while revolution swept over most of the countries of europe in 1848 norway was largely unaffected by revolts that year marcus thrane was a utopian socialist he made his appeal to the labouring classes urging a change of social structure from below upwards in 1848 he organised a labour society in drammen in just a few months this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper within two years 300 societies had been organised all over norway with a total membership of 20000 persons the membership was drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas for the first time these two groups felt they had a common cause in the end the revolt was easily crushed thrane was captured and in 1855 after four years in jail was sentenced to three additional years for crimes against the safety of the state upon his release marcus thrane attempted unsuccessfully to revitalise his movement but after the death of his wife he migrated to the united states in 1898 all men were granted universal suffrage followed by all women in 1913 dissolution of the union christian michelsen a shipping magnate and statesman and prime minister of norway from 1905 to 1907 played a central role in the peaceful separation of norway from sweden on 7 june 1905 a national referendum confirmed the peoples preference for a monarchy over a republic no norwegian could legitimately claim the throne because none was able to prove relationship to medieval royalty and in european tradition royal or blue blood is a precondition for laying claim to the throne the government offered the throne of norway to a prince of the dano-german royal house of schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-glcksburg prince carl of denmark was unanimously elected king by the norwegian parliament the first king of a fully independent norway in 508 years 1397 kalmar union he took the name haakon vii in 1905 the country welcomed the prince from neighbouring denmark his wife maud of wales and their young son to re-establish norways royal house following centuries of close ties between norway and denmark a prince from the latter was the obvious choice for a european prince who could best relate to the norwegian people first and second world wars throughout the first world war norway was in principle a neutral country in reality however norway had been pressured by the british to hand over increasingly large parts of its large merchant fleet to the british at low rates as well as to join the trade blockade against germany norwegian merchant marine ships often with norwegian sailors still on board were then sailing under the british flag and at risk of being sunk by german submarines thus many norwegian sailors and ships were lost thereafter the world ranking of the norwegian merchant navy fell from fourth place to sixth in the world norway also proclaimed its neutrality during the second world war but despite this it was invaded by german forces on 9 april 1940 although norway was unprepared for the german surprise attack see battle of drbak sound norwegian campaign and invasion of norway military and naval resistance lasted for two months norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the german forces in the battles of narvik until they were forced to surrender on 10 june after losing british support which had been diverted to france during the german invasion of france king haakon and the norwegian government escaped to rotherhithe in london throughout the war they sent inspirational radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions in norway against the germans on the day of the invasion the leader of the small national-socialist party nasjonal samling vidkun quisling tried to seize power but was forced by the german occupiers to step aside real power was wielded by the leader of the german occupation authority reichskommissar josef terboven quisling as minister president later formed a collaborationist government under german control up to 15000 norwegians volunteered to fight in german units including the waffen-ss the fraction of the norwegian population that supported germany was traditionally smaller than in sweden but greater than is generally appreciated today it included a number of prominent personalities such as the nobel-prize winning novelist knut hamsun the concept of a germanic union of member states fit well into their thoroughly nationalist-patriotic ideology many norwegians and persons of norwegian descent joined the allied forces as well as the free norwegian forces in june 1940 a small group had left norway following their king to britain this group included 13 ships five aircraft and 500 men from the royal norwegian navy by the end of the war the force had grown to 58 ships and 7500 men in service in the royal norwegian navy 5 squadrons of aircraft including spitfires sunderland flying boats and mosquitos in the newly formed norwegian air force and land forces including the norwegian independent company 1 and 5 troop as well as no 10 commandos during the five years of german occupation norwegians built a resistance movement which fought the german occupation forces with both civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of norsk hydros heavy water plant and stockpile of heavy water at vemork which crippled the german nuclear programme see norwegian heavy water sabotage more important to the allied war effort however was the role of the norwegian merchant marine at the time of the invasion norway had the fourth-largest merchant marine fleet in the world it was led by the norwegian shipping company nortraship under the allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the evacuation of dunkirk to the normandy landings each december norway gives a christmas tree to the united kingdom as thanks for the british assistance during the

post-world war ii history from 1945 to 1962 the labour party held an absolute majority in the parliament the government led by prime minister einar gerhardsen embarked on a program inspired by keynesian economics emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and employers organisations many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in 1949 while price control and rationing of housing and cars continued as long as until 1960 the wartime alliance with the united kingdom and the united states was continued in the post-war years although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy the labour party distanced itself from the communists especially after the communists seizure of power in czechoslovakia in 1948 and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the us norway received marshall plan aid from the united states starting in 1947 joined the organisation for economic co-operation and development oeec one year later and became a founding member of the north atlantic treaty organization nato in 1949 the first oil was discovered at the small balder field in 1967 production only began in 1999 in 1969 the phillips petroleum company discovered petroleum resources at the ekofisk field west of norway in 1973 the norwegian government founded the state oil company statoil oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the countrys petroleum industry around 1975 both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced norway was a founding member of the european free trade association efta norway was twice invited to join the european union but ultimately declined to join after referendums that failed by narrow margins in 1972 and 1994 in 1981 a conservative government led by kre willoch replaced the labour party with a policy of stimulating the stagflated economy with tax cuts economic liberalisation deregulation of markets and measures to curb record-high inflation 136 in 1981 norways first female prime minister gro harlem brundtland of the labour party continued many of the reforms of her conservative predecessor while backing traditional labour concerns such as social security high taxes the industrialisation of nature and feminism by the late 1990s norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a sovereign wealth fund since the 1990s a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend and how much it should save in 2011 norway suffered two terrorist attacks on the same day conducted by anders behring breivik which struck the government quarter in oslo and a summer camp of the labour partys youth movement at utya island resulting in 77 deaths and 319 wounded the 2013 norwegian parliamentary election brought a more conservative government to power with the conservative party and the progress party winning 43 of the electorates votes geography norways core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the scandinavian peninsula the remote island of jan mayen and the archipelago of svalbard are also part of the kingdom of norway the antarctic peter i island and the sub-antarctic bouvet island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the kingdom norway also lays claim to a section of antarctica known as queen maud land from the middle ages to 1814 norway was part of the danish kingdom norwegian possessions in the north atlantic faroe islands greenland and iceland remained danish when norway was passed to sweden at the treaty of kiel norway also comprised bohusln until 1658 jmtland and hrjedalen until 1645 shetland and orkney until 1468 and the hebrides and isle of man until the treaty of perth in 1266 norway comprises the western and northernmost part of scandinavia in northern europe norway lies between latitudes 57 and 81 n and longitudes 4 and 32 e norway is the northernmost of the nordic countries and if svalbard is included also the easternmost vard at 31 10 07 east of greenwich lies further east than st petersburg and istanbul norway includes the northernmost point on the european mainland the rugged coastline is broken by huge fjords and thousands of islands the coastal baseline is 2532 kilometres 1573mi the coastline of the mainland including fjords stretches 28953 kilometres 17991mi when islands are included the coastline has been estimated to 100915 kilometres 62706mi norway shares a 1619-kilometre 1006mi land border with sweden 727 kilometres 452mi with finland and 196 kilometres 122mi with russia to the east to the north west and south norway is bordered by the barents sea the norwegian sea the north sea and skagerrak the scandinavian mountains form much of the border with sweden at 385252 square kilometres 148747sqmi including svalbard and jan mayen and 323802 square kilometres 125021sqmi without much of the country is dominated by mountainous or high terrain with a great variety of natural features caused by prehistoric glaciers and varied topography the most noticeable of these are the fjords deep grooves cut into the land flooded by the sea following the end of the ice age sognefjorden is the worlds second deepest fjord and the worlds longest at 204 kilometres 127mi hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in all europe norway has about 400000 lakes there are registred 239057 islands permafrost can be found all year in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of finnmark county numerous glaciers are found in norway the land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock but slate sandstone and limestone are also common and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits because of the gulf stream and prevailing westerlies norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes especially along the coast the mainland experiences four distinct seasons with colder winters and less precipitation inland the northernmost part has a mostly maritime subarctic climate while svalbard has an arctic tundra climate because of the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate norway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other european country there are approximately 60000 species in norway and adjacent waters excluding bacteria and virus the norwegian shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive climate the southern and western parts of norway fully exposed to atlantic storm fronts experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow and have lower rain and snow totals than the west the lowlands around oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers but also cold weather and snow in wintertime because of norways high latitude there are large seasonal variations in daylight from late may to late july the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the arctic circle hence norways description as the land of the midnight sun and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day conversely from late november to late january the sun never rises above the horizon in the north and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country the coastal climate of norway is exceptionally mild compared with areas on similar latitudes elsewhere in the world with the gulf stream passing directly offshore the northern areas of the atlantic coast continuously warming the region in the winter temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional with rst and vry lacking a meteorological winter in spite of being north of the arctic circle the gulf stream has this effect only on the northern parts of norway not in the south despite what is commonly believed the northern coast of norway would thus be ice-covered if not for the gulf stream as a side-effect the scandinavian mountains prevent continental winds from reaching the coastline causing very cool summers throughout atlantic norway oslo has more of a continental climate similar to swedens the mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates there is also very high rainfall in areas exposed to the atlantic such as bergen oslo in comparison is dry being in a rain shadow skjk in oppland county is also in the rain shadow and is one of the driest places with 278 millimetres 109 inches precipitation annually finnmarksvidda and the interior valleys of troms and nordland also receive less than 300 millimetres 12 inches annually longyearbyen is the driest place in norway with 190 millimetres 75 inches parts of southeastern norway including parts of mjsa have warm-summer humid continental climates kppen dfb while the more southern and western coasts are mostly of the oceanic climate cfb further inland in southeastern and northern norway the subarctic climate dfc dominates this is especially true for areas in the rain shadow of the scandinavian mountains some of the inner valleys of oppland get so little precipitation annually thanks to the rain shadow effect that they meet the requirements for dry-summer subarctic climates dsc in higher altitudes close to the coasts of southern and western norway one can find the rare subpolar oceanic climate cfc this climate is also common in northern norway but there usually in lower altitudes all the way down to sea level a small part of the northernmost coast of norway has the tundraalpinepolar climate et large parts of norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus many of which also exhibit the tundraalpinepolar climate et biodiversity the total number of species include 16000 species of insects probably 4000 more species yet to be described 20000 species of algae 1800 species of lichen 1050 species of mosses 2800 species of vascular plants up to 7000 species of fungi 450 species of birds 250 species nesting in norway 90 species of mammals 45 fresh-water species of fish 150 salt-water species of fish 1000 species of fresh-water invertebrates and 3500 species of salt-water invertebrates about 40000 of these species have been described by science the red list of 2010 encompasses 4599 species seventeen species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale such as the european beaver even if the population in norway is not seen as endangered the number of threatened and near-threatened species equals to 3682 it includes 418 fungi species many of which are closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests 36 bird species and 16 species of mammals in 2010 2398 species were listed as endangered or vulnerable of these were 1250 listed as vulnerable vu 871 as endangered en and 276 species as critically endangered cr among which were the grey wolf the arctic fox healthy population on svalbard and the pool frog the largest predator in norwegian waters is the sperm whale and the largest fish is the basking shark the largest predator on land is the polar bear while the brown bear is the largest predator on the norwegian mainland the largest land animal on the mainland is the elk american english moose the elk in norway is known for its size and strength and is often called skogens konge king of the forest environment attractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout norway the west coast of southern norway and the coast of northern norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world national geographic has listed the norwegian fjords as the worlds top tourist attraction the country is also home to the natural phenomena of the midnight sun during summer as well as the aurora borealis known also as the northern lights the 2016 environmental performance index from yale university columbia university and the world economic forum put norway in seventeenth place immediately below croatia and switzerland the index is based on environmental risks to human health habitat loss and changes in co2 emissions the index notes over-exploitation of fisheries but not norways whaling or oil exports politics and government norway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and states of justice in the world from 1814 c 45 of men 25 years and older had the right to vote whereas the united kingdom had c 20 1832 sweden c 5 1866 and belgium c 115 1840 since 2010 norway has been classified as the worlds most democratic country by the democracy index according to the constitution of norway which was adopted on 17 may 1814 and inspired by the united states declaration of independence and french revolution of 1776 and 1789 respectively norway is a unitary constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government wherein the king of norway is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government power is separated among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government as defined by the constitution which serves as the countrys supreme legal document the monarch officially retains executive power but following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government accordingly the monarch is commander-in-chief of the norwegian armed forces and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity harald v of the house of schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-glcksburg was crowned king of norway in 1991 the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country haakon crown prince of norway is the legal and rightful heir to the throne and the kingdom in practice the prime minister exercises the executive powers constitutionally legislative power is vested with both the government and the parliament of norway but the latter is the supreme legislature and a unicameral body norway is fundamentally structured as a representative democracy the parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives who are elected on the basis of proportional representation from 19 constituencies for four-year terms 150 are elected directly from the 19 constituencies and an additional 19 seats levelling seats are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties a 4 election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in parliament there are a total of 169 members of parliament the parliament of norway called the stortinget meaning grand assembly ratifies national treaties developed by the executive branch it can impeach members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional if an indicted suspect is impeached parliament has the power to remove the person from office the position of prime minister norways head of government is allocated to the member of parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in parliament usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties a single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a government on its own norway has often been ruled by minority governments the prime minister nominates the cabinet traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the storting making up the government the pm organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the constitution norway has a state church the lutheran church of norway which has in recent years gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day-to-day affairs but which still has a special constitutional status formerly the pm had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the church of norway meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries this rule was however removed in 2012 the issue of separation of church and state in norway has been increasingly controversial as many people believe it is time to change this to reflect the growing diversity in the population a part of this is the evolution of the public school subject christianity a required subject since 1739 even the states loss in a battle at the european court of human rights at strasbourg in 2007 did not settle the matter as of 1 january 2017 the church of norway is a separate legal entity and no longer a branch of the civil service through the council of state a privy council presided over by the monarch the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the royal palace and formally consult the monarch all government bills need the formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to parliament the council reviews and approves all of the monarchs actions as head of state although all government and parliamentary acts are decided beforehand the privy council is an example of symbolic gesture the king retains members of the storting are directly elected from party-lists proportional representation in nineteen plural-member constituencies in a national multi-party system historically both the norwegian labour party and conservative party have played leading political roles in the early 21st century the labour party has been in power since the 2005 election in a redgreen coalition with the socialist left party and the centre party since 2005 both the conservative party and the progress party have won numerous seats in the parliament but not sufficient in the 2009 general election to overthrow the coalition commentators have pointed to the poor co-operation between the opposition parties including the liberals and the christian democrats jens stoltenberg the leader of the labour party continued to have the necessary majority through his multi-party alliance to continue as pm until 2013 in national elections in september 2013 voters ended eight years of labor rule two political parties hyre and fremskrittspartiet elected on promises of tax cuts more spending on infrastructure and education better services and stricter rules on immigration formed a government coming at a time when norways economy is in good condition with low unemployment the rise of the right appeared to be based on other issues erna solberg became prime minister the second female prime minister after brundtland and the first conservative prime minister since syse solberg said her win was a historic election victory for the right-wing parties administrative divisions norway a unitary state is divided into eighteen first-level administrative counties fylke the counties are administrated through directly elected county assemblies who elect the county governor additionally the king and government are represented in every county by a fylkesmann who effectively acts as a governor as such the government is directly represented at a local level through the county governors offices the counties are then sub-divided into 422-second-level municipalities kommuner which in turn are administrated by directly elected municipal council headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet the capital of oslo is considered both a county and a municipality norway has two integral overseas territories jan mayen and svalbard the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name located miles away to the north there are three antarctic and subantarctic dependencies bouvet island peter i island and queen maud land on most maps there had been an unclaimed area between queen maud land and the south pole until 12 june 2015 when norway formally annexed that area 96 settlements have city status in norway in most cases the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities often norwegian city municipalities include large areas that are not developed for example oslo municipality contains large forests located north and south-east of the city and over half of bergen municipality consists of mountainous areas the counties of norway are largest cities judicial system and law enforcement norway uses a civil law system where laws are created and amended in parliament and the system regulated through the courts of justice of norway it consists of the supreme court of 20 permanent judges and a chief justice appellate courts city and district courts and conciliation councils the judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches while the prime minister nominates supreme court justices for office their nomination must be approved by parliament and formally confirmed by the monarch in the council of state usually judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister the courts strict and formal mission is to regulate the norwegian judicial system interpret the constitution and as such implement the legislation adopted by parliament in its judicial reviews it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation the law is enforced in norway by the norwegian police service it is a unified national police service made up of 27 police districts and several specialist agencies such as norwegian national authority for the investigation and prosecution of economic and environmental crime known as kokrim and the national criminal investigation service known as kripos each headed by a chief of police the police service is headed by the national police directorate which reports to the ministry of justice and the police the police directorate is headed by a national police commissioner the only exception is the norwegian police security agency whose head answers directly to the ministry of justice and the police norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in 1902 the legislature abolished the death penalty for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979 reporters without borders in its 2007 worldwide press freedom index ranked norway at a shared first place along with iceland out of 169 countries

low norway has ratified all relevant international anti-corruption conventions and its standards of implementation and enforcement of anti-corruption legislation are considered very high by many

30 of the labour force are employed by the government the highest in the oecd the hourly productivity levels as well as average hourly wages in norway are among the highest in the world the egalitarian values of norwegian society have kept the wage difference between the lowest paid worker and the ceo of most companies as much less than in comparable western economies this is also evident in norways low gini coefficient the state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors such as the strategic petroleum sector statoil hydroelectric energy production statkraft aluminium production norsk hydro the largest norwegian bank dnb and telecommunication provider telenor through these big companies the government controls approximately 30 of the stock values at the

agreements among the eu member states the country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum hydropower fish forests and minerals large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s which led to a boom in the economy norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population in 2011 28 of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry norway is the first country which banned cutting of trees deforestation in order to prevent rain forests from vanishing the country declared its intention at the un climate summit in 2014 alongside great britain and germany crops that are typically linked to forests destruction are timber soy palm oil and beef now norway has to find a new way to provide these essential products without exerting negative influence on its environment resources export revenues from oil and gas have risen to almost 50 of total exports and constitute more than 20 of the gdp norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world but it is not a member of opec in 1995 the norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund government pension fund global which would be funded with oil revenues including taxes dividends sales revenues and licensing fees this was intended to reduce overheating in the economy from oil revenues minimise uncertainty from volatility in oil price and provide a cushion to compensate for expenses associated with the ageing of the population the government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields with approximately 62 ownership in statoil in 2007 and the fully state-owned petoro which has a market value of about twice statoil and sdfi finally the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields the fund invests in developed financial markets outside norway the budgetary rule handlingsregelen is to spend no more than 4 of the fund each year assumed to be the normal yield from the fund between 1966 and 2013 norwegian companies drilled 5085

generate roughly 9899 of norways electric power more than any other country in the world norway contains significant mineral resources and in 2013 its mineral production was valued at us15billion norwegian geological survey data the most valuable minerals are calcium carbonate limestone building stone nepheline syenite olivine iron titanium and nickel in march 2017 the government pension fund controlled assets were valued at approximately us913billion equal to us182000 per capita which is about 178 of norways current gdp it is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world the fund controls about 13 of all listed shares in europe and more than 1 of all the publicly traded shares in the world the norwegian central bank operates investment offices in london new york and shanghai guidelines implemented in 2007 allow the fund to invest up to 60 of the capital in shares maximum of 40 prior while the rest may be placed in bonds and real-estate as the stock markets tumbled in september 2008 the fund was able to buy more shares at low prices in this way the losses incurred by the market turmoil was recuperated by november 2009 other nations with economies based on natural resources such as russia are trying to learn from norway by establishing similar funds the investment choices of the norwegian fund are directed by ethical guidelines for example the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons norways highly transparent investment scheme is lauded by the international community the future size of the fund is closely linked to the price of oil and to developments in international financial markets in 2000 the government sold one-third of the state-owned oil company statoil in an ipo the next year the main telecom supplier telenor was listed on oslo stock exchange the state also owns significant shares of norways largest bank dnb nor and the airline sas since 2000 economic growth has been rapid pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s unemployment in 2007 13 the international financial crisis has primarily affected the industrial sector but unemployment has remained low and was at 33 86000 people in august 2011 in contrast to norway sweden had substantially higher actual and projected unemployment numbers as a result of the recession thousands of mainly young swedes migrated to norway for work during these years which is easy as the labour market and social security systems overlap in the nordic countries in the first quarter of 2009 the gnp of norway surpassed swedens for the first time in history although its population is half the size between 1966 and 2013 norwegian companies drilled 5085 oil wells mostly in the north sea of these 3672 are

its public transport is less developed than in many european countries especially outside the major cities the country has long-standing water transport traditions but the norwegian ministry of transport and communications has in recent years implemented rail road and air transport through numerous subsidiaries to develop the countrys infrastructure under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nations largest cities norways main railway network consists of 4114 kilometres 2556mi of standard gauge lines of which 242 kilometres 150mi is double track and 64 kilometres 40mi high-speed rail 210kmh while 62 is electrified at 15kv 167hz ac the railways transported 56827000 passengers 2956 million passenger-kilometres and 24783000 tonnes of cargo 3414 million tonne-kilometres the entire network is owned by the norwegian national rail administration all domestic passenger trains except the airport express train are operated by norges statsbaner nsb several companies operate freight trains investment in new infrastructure and maintenance is financed through the state budget and subsidies are provided for passenger train operations nsb operates long-haul trains including night trains regional services and four commuter train systems around oslo trondheim bergen and stavanger norway has approximately 92946 kilometres 57754mi of road network of which 72033 kilometres 44759mi are paved and 664 kilometres 413mi are motorway the four tiers of road routes are national county municipal and private with national and primary county roads numbered en route the most important national routes are part of the european route scheme the two most prominent are the e6 going north-south through the entire country and the e39 which follows the west coast national and county roads are managed by the norwegian public roads administration norway has the worlds largest registered stock of plug-in electric vehicles per capita in march 2014 norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads is a plug-in electric the plug-in electric segment market share of new car sales is also the highest in the world according to a report by dagens nringsliv in june 2016 the country would like to ban all gasoline and diesel powered vehicles as early as 2025 in june 2017 42 of new cars registered were electric of the 98 airports in norway 52 are public and 46 are operated by the state-owned avinor seven airports have more than one million passengers annually a total of 41089675 passengers passed through norwegian airports in

airlines scandinavian airlines and norwegian air shuttle and for regional aircraft from western norway there are departures to most european countries and some intercontinental destinations a direct high-speed train connects to oslo central station every 10 minutes for a 20 min ride demographics languages norwegian and smi are the two official languages of norway the north germanic norwegian language has two official written forms bokml and nynorsk both are used in public administration schools churches and media bokml is the written language used by a large majority of about 8085 around 95 of the population speak norwegian as their first or native language although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages all norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle to understand certain phrases and pronunciations in some other dialects several uralic smi languages are spoken and written throughout the country especially in the north by some members of the smi people estimates suggest that about one third of the norwegian smi speak a smi language speakers have a right to be educated and to receive communication from the government in their own language in a special forvaltningsomrde administrative area for smi languages the kven minority historically spoke the uralic kven language considered a separate language in norway but generally perceived as a finnish dialect in finland today the majority of ethnic kven have little or no knowledge of the language according to the kainun institutti the typical modern kven is a norwegian-speaking norwegian who knows his genealogy as norway has ratified the european charter for regional or minority languages ecrml the kven language together with romani and scandoromani language has become officially recognised minority languages some supporters have also advocated making norwegian sign language an
