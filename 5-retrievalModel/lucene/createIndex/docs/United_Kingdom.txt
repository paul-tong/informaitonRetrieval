organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd interpol and the world trade organization wto etymology and terminology the 1707 acts of union declared that the kingdoms of england and scotland were united into one kingdom by the name of great britain the term united kingdom has occasionally been used as a description for the former kingdom of great britain although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply great britain the acts of union 1800 united the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland in 1801 forming the united kingdom of great britain and ireland following the partition of ireland and the independence of the irish free state in 1922 which left northern ireland as the only part of the island of ireland within the united kingdom the name was changed to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland although the united kingdom is a sovereign country england scotland wales and northern ireland are also widely referred to as countries the uk prime ministers website has used the phrase countries within a country to describe the united kingdom some statistical summaries such as those for the twelve nuts 1 regions of the united kingdom refer to scotland wales and northern ireland as regions northern ireland is also referred to as a province with regard to northern ireland the descriptive name used can be controversial with the choice often revealing ones political preferences the term great britain conventionally refers to the island of great britain or politically to england scotland and wales in combination however it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the united kingdom as a whole the term britain is used both as a synonym for great britain and as a synonym for the united kingdom usage is mixed with the bbc preferring to use britain as shorthand only for great britain and the uk government while accepting that both terms refer to the united kingdom preferring to use the term uk rather than britain the uk permanent committee on geographical names lists united kingdom and uk or uk as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it does not list britain stating that it has been used informally by government websites the adjective british is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the united kingdom the term has no definite legal connotation but is used in law to refer to united kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality people of the united kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being british english scottish welsh northern irish or irish or as belonging to a combination of different national identities history background settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the united kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30000 years ago by the end of the regions prehistoric period the population is thought to have belonged in the main to a culture termed insular celtic comprising brittonic britain and gaelic ireland the roman conquest beginning in 43 ad and the 400-year rule of southern britain was followed by an invasion by germanic anglo-saxon settlers reducing the brittonic area mainly to what was to become wales cornwall and until the latter stages of the anglo-saxon settlement the hen ogledd northern england and parts of southern scotland most of the region settled by the anglo-saxons became unified as the kingdom of england in the 10th century meanwhile gaelic-speakers in north-west britain with connections to the north-east of ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century united with the picts to create the kingdom of scotland in the 9th century in 1066 the normans and their breton allies invaded england from northern france and after its conquest seized large parts of wales conquered much of ireland and were invited to settle in scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the northern french model and norman-french culture the anglo-norman ruling class greatly influenced but eventually assimilated with each of the local cultures subsequent medieval english kings completed the conquest of wales and made an unsuccessful attempt to annex scotland following the declaration of arbroath scotland maintained its independence albeit in near-constant conflict with england the english monarchs through inheritance of substantial territories in france and claims to the french crown were also heavily involved in conflicts in france most notably the hundred years war while the kings of scots were in an alliance with the french during this period the early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the reformation and the introduction of protestant state churches in each country wales was fully incorporated into the kingdom of england and ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the english crown in what was to become northern ireland the lands of the independent catholic gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to protestant settlers from england and scotland in 1603 the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland were united in a personal union when james vi king of scots inherited the crowns of england and ireland and moved his court from edinburgh to london each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political legal and religious institutions in the mid-17th century all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars including the english civil war which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the commonwealth of england scotland and ireland during the 17th and 18th centuries british sailors were involved in acts of piracy privateering attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of europe and the caribbean although the monarchy was restored the interregnum ensured along with the glorious revolution of 1688 and the subsequent bill of rights 1689 and the claim of right act 1689 that unlike much of the rest of europe royal absolutism would not prevail and a professed catholic could never accede to the throne the british constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system with the founding of the royal society in 1660 science was greatly encouraged during this period particularly in england the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies particularly in north america though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within great britain in 1606 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the treaty of union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments treaty of union on 1 may 1707 the united kingdom of great britain came into being the result of acts of union being passed by the parliaments of england and scotland to ratify the 1706 treaty of union and so unite the two kingdoms in the 18th century cabinet government developed under robert walpole in practice the first prime minister 17211742 a series of jacobite uprisings sought to remove the protestant house of hanover from the british throne and restore the catholic house of stuart the jacobites were finally defeated at the battle of culloden in 1746 after which the scottish highlanders were brutally suppressed the british colonies in north america that broke away from britain in the american war of independence became the united states of america recognised by britain in 1783 british imperial ambition turned towards asia particularly to india during the 18th century britain was involved in the atlantic slave trade british ships transported an estimated two million slaves from africa to the west indies parliament banned the trade in 1807 banned slavery in the british empire in 1833 and britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties the worlds oldest international human rights organisation anti-slavery international was formed in london in 1839 union with ireland the term united kingdom became official in 1801 when the parliaments of britain and ireland each passed an act of union uniting the two kingdoms and creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland in the early 19th century the british-led industrial revolution began to transform the country gradually political power shifted away from the old tory and whig landowning classes towards the new industrialists an alliance of merchants and industrialists with the whigs would lead to a new party the liberals with an ideology of free trade and laissez-faire in 1832 parliament passed the great reform act which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes in the countryside enclosure of the land was driving small farmers out towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class few ordinary workers had the vote and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions after the defeat of france at the end of the revolutionary and napoleonic wars 17921815 great britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century with london the largest city in the world from about 1830 unchallenged at sea british dominance was later described as pax britannica british peace a period of relative peace among the great powers 18151914 during which the british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman by the time of the great exhibition of 1851 britain was described as the workshop of the world the british empire was expanded to include india large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions such as asia and latin america domestically political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise during the century the population increased at a dramatic rate accompanied by rapid urbanisation causing significant social and economic stresses to seek new markets and sources of raw materials the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt south africa and elsewhere canada australia and new zealand became self-governing dominions after the turn of the century britains industrial dominance was challenged by germany and the united states social reform and home rule for ireland were important domestic issues after 1900 the labour party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900 and suffragettes campaigned for womens right to vote before 1914 britain fought alongside france russia and after 1917 the united states against germany and its allies in the first world war 19141918 british armed forces were engaged across much of the british empire and in several regions of europe particularly on the western front the high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order after the war britain received the league of nations mandate over a number of former german and ottoman colonies the british empire reached its greatest extent covering a fifth of the worlds land surface and a quarter of its population however britain had suffered 25 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt irish independence the rise of irish nationalism and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921 the irish free state became independent initially with dominion status in 1922 and unambiguously independent in 1931 northern ireland remained part of the united kingdom a wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the general strike of 1926 britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the great depression 19291932 occurred this led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s with rising membership in communist and socialist parties a coalition government was formed in 1931 britain entered the second world war by declaring war on nazi germany in 1939 after germany had invaded poland winston churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940 despite the defeat of its european allies in the first year of the war britain and its empire continued the fight alone against germany in 1940 the royal air force defeated the german luftwaffe in a struggle for control of the skies in the battle of britain urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the blitz there were also eventual hard-fought victories in the battle of the atlantic the north africa campaign and the burma campaign british forces played an important role in the normandy landings of 1944 achieved with its united states ally since the second world war after the end of the second world war in 1945 the uk was one of the big four powers along with the us the soviet union and china who met to plan the post-war world it was an original signatory to the declaration of the united nations the uk became one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and worked closely with the united states to establish the imf world bank and nato however the war left the uk severely weakened and depending financially on the marshall plan in the immediate post-war years the labour government initiated a radical programme of reforms which had a significant effect on british society in the following decades major industries and public utilities were nationalised a welfare state was established and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system the national health service was created the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britains now much-diminished economic position so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable independence was granted to india and pakistan in 1947 over the next three decades most colonies of the british empire gained their independence many became members of the commonwealth of nations the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test in 1952 but the new post-war limits of britains international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of 1956 the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture as a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s the government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries in the following decades the uk became a more multi-ethnic society than before despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s the uks economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as france west germany and japan in the decade-long process of european integration the uk was a founding member of the alliance called the western european union established with the london and paris conferences in 1954 in 1960 the uk was one of the seven founding members of the european free trade association efta but in 1973 it left to join the european communities ec when the ec became the european union eu in 1992 the uk was one of the 12 founding members the treaty of lisbon was signed in 2007 which forms the constitutional basis of the european union since then from the late 1960s northern ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence sometimes affecting other parts of the uk conventionally known as the troubles it is usually considered to have ended with the belfast good friday agreement of 1998 following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s the conservative government of the 1980s under margaret thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example big bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of state-owned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest but ultimately also economic growth particularly in the services sector from 1984 the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily it plays leading roles in the eu un and nato however controversy surrounds some of britains overseas military deployments particularly in afghanistan and iraq the 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the uk economy the coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted in 2014 the scottish government held a referendum on scottish independence with 553 of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain within the united kingdom in 2016 519 of voters in the united kingdom voted to leave the european union the legal process of leaving the eu began on 29 march 2017 with the uks invocation of article 50 of the treaty of lisbon formally notifying the eu of the uks intention to leave the article stipulates that the negotiations to leave will last at least two years the uk remains a full member of the eu during this time geography the total area of the united kingdom is approximately 243610 square kilometres 94060sqmi the country occupies the major part of the british isles archipelago and includes the island of great britain the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of ireland and some smaller surrounding islands it lies between the north atlantic ocean and the north sea with the south-east coast coming within 22 miles 35km of the coast of northern france from which it is separated by the english channel in 1993 10 of the uk was forested 46 used for pastures and 25 cultivated for agriculture the royal greenwich observatory in london was chosen as the defining point of the prime meridian in washington in 1884 though it no longer is the united kingdom lies between latitudes 49 and 61 n and longitudes 9 w and 2 e northern ireland shares a 224-mile 360km land boundary with the republic of ireland the coastline of great britain is 11073 miles 17820km long it is connected to continental europe by the channel tunnel which at 31 miles 50km 24 miles 38km underwater is the longest underwater tunnel in the world england accounts for just over half 53 of the total area of the uk covering 130395 square kilometres 50350sqmi most of the country consists of lowland terrain with mountainous terrain north-west of the tees-exe line including the cumbrian mountains of the lake district the pennines exmoor and dartmoor the main rivers and estuaries are the thames severn and the humber englands highest mountain is scafell pike 978 metres 3209ft in the lake district scotland accounts for just under a third 32 of the total area of the uk covering 78772 square kilometres 30410sqmi and including nearly eight hundred islands predominantly west and north of the mainland notably the hebrides orkney islands and shetland islands scotland is the most mountainous country in the uk and its topography is distinguished by the highland boundary faulta geological rock fracturewhich traverses scotland from arran in the west to stonehaven in the east the fault separates two distinctively different regions namely the highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east the more rugged highland region contains the majority of scotlands mountainous land including ben nevis which at 1345 metres 4413ft is the highest point in the british isles lowland areasespecially the narrow waist of land between the firth of clyde and the firth of forth known as the central beltare flatter and home to most of the population including glasgow scotlands largest city and edinburgh its capital and political centre although upland and mountainous terrain lies within the southern uplands wales accounts for less than a tenth 9 of the total area of the uk covering 20779 square kilometres 8020sqmi wales is mostly mountainous though south wales is less mountainous than north and mid wales the main population and industrial areas are in south wales consisting of the coastal cities of cardiff swansea and newport and the south wales valleys to their north the highest mountains in wales are in snowdonia and include snowdon welsh yr wyddfa which at 1085 metres 3560ft is the highest peak in wales wales has over 2704 kilometres 1680 miles of coastline several islands lie off the welsh mainland the largest of which is anglesey ynys mn in the north-west northern ireland separated from great britain by the irish sea and north channel has an area of 14160 square kilometres 5470sqmi and is mostly hilly it includes lough neagh which at 388 square kilometres 150sqmi is the largest lake in the british isles by area the highest peak in northern ireland is slieve donard in the mourne mountains at 852 metres 2795ft climate the united kingdom has a temperate climate with plentiful rainfall all year round the temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 11c 12f or rising above 35c 95f the prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the atlantic ocean although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest atlantic currents warmed by the gulf stream bring mild winters especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground summers are warmest in the south-east of england being closest to the european mainland and coolest in the north heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills administrative divisions the geographical division of the united kingdom into counties or shires began in england and scotland in the early middle ages and was complete throughout great britain and ireland by the early modern period administrative arrangements were developed separately in each country of the united kingdom with origins which often pre-dated the formation of the united kingdom modern local government by elected councils partly based on the ancient counties was introduced separately in england and wales in a 1888 act scotland in a 1889 act and ireland in a 1898 act meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the united kingdom until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function the organisation of local government in england is complex with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements the upper-tier subdivisions of england are the nine regions now used primarily for statistical purposes one region greater london has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies but a proposed assembly in the north east region was rejected by a referendum in 2004 below the regional tier some parts of england have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities while london consists of 32 london boroughs and the city of london councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards for local government purposes scotland is divided into 32 council areas with wide variation in both size and population the cities of glasgow edinburgh aberdeen and dundee are separate council areas as is the highland council which includes a third of scotlands area but only just over 200000people local councils are made up of elected councillors of whom there are 1223 they are paid a part-time salary elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors each council elects a provost or convenor to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area local government in wales consists of 22 unitary authorities these include the cities of cardiff swansea and newport which are unitary authorities in their own right elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system local government in northern ireland has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils each elected by single transferable vote their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries in 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system dependencies the united kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories which do not form part of the united kingdom itself fourteen british overseas territories and three crown dependencies the fourteen british overseas territories are anguilla bermuda the british antarctic territory the british indian ocean territory the british virgin islands the cayman islands the falkland islands gibraltar montserrat saint helena ascension and tristan da cunha the turks and caicos islands the pitcairn islands south georgia and the south sandwich islands and akrotiri and dhekelia on the island of cyprus british claims in antarctica are not universally recognised mainly by argentina whose claims cover a majority of the british sector collectively britains overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 1727570 square kilometres 667018sqmi and a population of approximately 260000 people they are the last remaining remnants of the british empire and a 1999 uk government white paper stated that the overseas territories are british for as long as they wish to remain british britain has willingly granted independence where it has been requested and we will continue to do so where this is an option self-determination is also enshrined into the constitutions of several overseas territories and three have specifically voted to remain under british sovereignty bermuda in 1995 gibraltar in 2002 and the falkland islands in 2013 the crown dependencies are possessions of the crown as opposed to overseas territories of the uk they comprise three independently administered jurisdictions the channel islands of jersey and guernsey in the english channel and the isle of man in the irish sea by mutual agreement the british government manages the islands foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf however internationally they are regarded as territories for which the united kingdom is responsible the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies with the assent of the crown privy council or in the case of the isle of man in certain circumstances the lieutenant-governor since 2005 each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government the british dependencies use a varied assortment of currencies these include the british pound us dollar new zealand dollar euro or their own currencies which may be pegged to either politics the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy queen elizabeth ii is the monarch and head of state of the uk as well as fifteen other independent countries these sixteen countries are sometimes referred to as commonwealth realms the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn the constitution of the united kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources including statutes judge-made case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law the uk parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing acts of parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution however no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change government the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the british empire the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses an elected house of commons and an appointed house of lords all bills passed are given royal assent before becoming law the position of prime minister the uks head of government belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber the prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form her majestys government by convention the monarch respects the prime ministers decisions of government the cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the prime ministers party or coalition and mostly from the house of commons but always from both legislative houses the cabinet being responsible to both executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet all of whom are sworn into the privy council of the united kingdom and become ministers of the crown the current prime minister is theresa may who has been in office since 13 july 2016 may is also the leader of the conservative party for elections to the house of commons the uk is divided into 650 constituencies each electing a single member of parliament mp by simple plurality general elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises prior to the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election the conservative party the labour party and the liberal democrats formerly as the liberal party have in modern times been considered the uks three major political parties representing the british traditions of conservatism socialism and liberalism respectively however in both the 2015 and 2017 general elections the scottish national party was the third-largest party by number of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party and sinn fin northern ireland only in accordance with party policy no elected sinn fin members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch devolved administrations scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uks government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so-called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively on matters that affect only england the 2013 mckay commission on this recommended that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament the scottish government and parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 553 to 447 resulting in scotland remaining a devolved part of the united kingdom the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north-south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the britishirish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non-operation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland law and criminal justice the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotlands separate legal system today the uk has three distinct systems of law english law northern ireland law and scots law a new supreme court of the united kingdom came into being in october 2009 to replace the appellate committee of the house of lords the judicial committee of the privy council including the same members as the supreme court is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies both english law which applies in england and wales and northern ireland law are based on common-law principles the essence of common law is that subject to statute the law is developed by judges in courts applying statute precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or

victorious from conflicts britain has often been able to decisively influence world events since the end of the british empire the uk has remained a major military power following the end of the cold war defence policy has a stated assumption that the most demanding operations will be undertaken as part of a coalition uk military operations in bosnia kosovo afghanistan iraq and libya have followed this approach setting aside the intervention in sierra leone in 2000 the last occasion on which the british military fought alone was the falklands war of 1982 according to various sources including

accounted for 7 gva in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per annum between 1997 and 2005 the industrial revolution started in the uk with an initial concentration on the textile industry followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding coal mining and steelmaking british merchants shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the uk to dominate international trade in the 19th century as other nations industrialised coupled with economic decline after two world wars the united kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined by degrees throughout the 20th century manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 167 of national output in 2003 the automotive industry is a significant part of the uk manufacturing sector and employs around 800000 people with a turnover in 2015 of 70 billion generating 346 billion of exports 118 of the uks total export goods in 2015 the uk produced

other developed countries the poverty line in the uk is commonly defined as being 60 of the median household income the office for national statistics has estimated that in 2011 14 million people were at risk of poverty or social exclusion and that one person in 20 51 was experiencing severe material depression up from 3 million people in 1977 although the uk does not have an official poverty measure the joseph rowntree foundation and the social metrics commission estimate based on government data that there are 14 million people in poverty in the uk 15 million people experienced destitution in 2017 in 2018 the un special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights visited the uk and found that government policies and cuts to social support are entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world the uk has an external debt of 96 trillion dollars which is the second highest in the world after the us as a percentage of gdp external debt is 408 which is the third highest in the world after luxembourg and iceland the combination of the uks relatively lax regulatory regime and londons financial institutions providing sophisticated methods to launder proceeds from criminal activity around the world including those from drug trade makes the city of london a global hub for illicit finance and the uk a safe haven for the worlds major-league tax dodgers according to research papers and reports published in the mid-2010s the reports on the panama papers published in april 2016 singled out the uk as being at the heart of super-rich tax-avoidance network science and technology england and scotland were leading centres of the scientific revolution from the 17th century the united kingdom led the industrial revolution from the 18th century and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include isaac newton whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science from the 19th century charles darwin whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology and james clerk maxwell who formulated classical electromagnetic theory and more recently stephen hawking who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by henry cavendish from the 20th century penicillin by alexander fleming and the structure of dna by francis crick and others famous british engineers and inventors of the industrial revolution include james watt george stephenson richard arkwright robert

first working television system by john logie baird and others the jet engine by frank whittle the basis of the modern computer by alan turing and the world wide web by tim berners-lee scientific research and development remains important in british universities with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry between 2004 and 2008 the uk produced 7 of the worlds scientific research papers and had an 8 share of scientific citations the third and second highest in the world after the united states and china respectively scientific journals

british rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997 which was followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers following years of decline although the factors behind this are disputed the uk was ranked eighth among national european rail systems in the 2017 european railway performance index assessing intensity of use quality of service and safety network rail owns and manages most of the fixed assets tracks signals etc about 20 privately owned train operating companies operate passenger trains which carried 168 billion passengers in 2015 there are also some 1000 freight trains in

most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world and is the hub for the uk flag carrier british airways as well as virgin atlantic energy in 2006 the uk was the worlds ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer the uk is home to a number of large energy companies including two of the six oil and gas supermajorsbp and royal dutch shell in 2011 40 of the uks electricity was produced by gas 30 by coal 19 by nuclear power and 42 by wind hydro biofuels and wastes in 2013 the uk produced 914thousand barrels per day bbld of oil and consumed 1507thousand bbld production is now in decline and the uk has been a net importer of oil since 2005 in 2010 the uk had around 31billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves the largest of any eu member state in 2009 the uk was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the eu production is now in decline and the uk has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004 coal production played a key role in the uk economy in the 19th and 20th centuries in the mid-1970s 130 million tonnes of coal were produced annually not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s during the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably in 2011 the uk produced 183 million tonnes of coal in 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171million tons the uk coal authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7billion tonnes and 16billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification ucg or fracking and that based on current uk coal consumption such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years however environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes in the late 1990s nuclear power plants contributed around 25 of total annual electricity generation in the uk but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability in 2012 the uk had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 of its electricity all but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023 unlike germany and japan the uk intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018 the total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 149 of the electricity generated in the united kingdom in 2013 reaching 537 twh of electricity generated the uk is one of the best sites in europe for wind energy and wind power production is its fastest growing supply in 2014 it generated 93 of the uks total electricity water supply and sanitation access to improved water supply and sanitation in the uk is universal it is estimated that 967 of households are connected to the sewer network according to the environment agency total water abstraction for public water supply in the uk was 16406 megalitres per day in 2007 drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards in the uk as in other countries of the european union are determined by the eu see water supply and sanitation in the european union in england and wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private water only companies in scotland water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company scottish water in northern ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity northern ireland water demographics a census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the uk every ten years in the 2011 census the total population of the united kingdom was 63181775 it is the third-largest in the european union the fifth-largest in the commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world in mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth in mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 07 this compares to 03 per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 02 in the decade 1981 to 1991 the 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 014 has nearly halved 31 in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011 and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled from 5 to 16 englands population in 2011 was 53 million it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with 420people resident per square kilometre in mid-2015 with a particular concentration in london and the south-east the 2011 census put scotlands population at 53 million wales at 306 million and northern ireland at 181 million in 2012 the average total fertility rate tfr across the uk was 192 children per woman while a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 295 children per woman in 1964 below the replacement rate of 21 but higher than the 2001 record low of 163 in 2011 473 of births in the uk were to unmarried women the office for national statistics published a bulletin in 2015 showing that out of the uk population aged 16 and over 17 identify as lesbian gay or bisexual 20 of males and 15 of females 45 of respondents responded with other i dont know or did not respond ethnic groups historically indigenous british people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century the celts romans anglo-saxons norse and the normans welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the uk a 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 of englands gene pool contains germanic y chromosomes another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that about 75 of the traceable ancestors of the modern british population had arrived in the british isles by about 6200 years ago at the start of the british neolithic or stone age and that the british broadly share a common ancestry with the basque people the uk has a history of small-scale non-white immigration with liverpool having the oldest black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the african slave trade during this period it is estimated the afro-caribbean population of great britain was 10000 to 15000 which later declined due to the abolition of slavery the uk also has the oldest chinese community in europe dating to the arrival of chinese seamen in the 19th century in 1950 there were probably fewer than 20000 non-white residents in britain almost all born overseas in 1951 there were an estimated 94500 people living in britain who had been born in south asia china africa and the caribbean just under 02 of the uk population by 1961 this number had more than quadrupled to 384000 just over 07 of the united kingdom population since 1948 substantial immigration from africa the caribbean and south asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the british empire migration from new eu member states in central and eastern europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups although some of this migration has been temporary since the 1990s there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population with migrants to the uk coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in british national statistics which were first introduced in the 1991 census involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race in 2011 872 of the uk population identified themselves as white meaning 128 of the uk population identify themselves as of one of number of ethnic minority groups in the 2001 census this figure was 79 of the uk population because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in england and wales scotland and northern ireland data on the other white group is not available for the uk as a whole but in england and wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses increasing by 11 million 18 percentage points amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the uk level the other asian category increased from 04 to 14 of the population between 2001 and 2011 while the mixed category rose from 12 to 2 ethnic diversity varies significantly across the uk 304 of londons population and 374 of leicesters was estimated to be non-white in 2005 whereas less than 5 of the populations of north east england wales and the south west were from ethnic minorities according to the 2001 census in 2016 314 of primary and 279 of secondary pupils at state schools in england were members of an ethnic minority the 1991 census was the first uk census to have a question on ethnic group in the 1991 uk census 941 of people reported themselves as being white british white irish or white other with 59 of people reporting themselves as coming from other minority groups languages the uks de facto official language is english it is estimated that 95 of the uks population are monolingual english speakers 55 of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the uk as a result of relatively recent immigration south asian languages including punjabi hindi bengali and gujarati are the largest grouping and are spoken by 27 of the uk population according to the 2011 census polish has become the second-largest language spoken in england and has 546000 speakers four celtic languages are spoken in the uk welsh irish scottish gaelic and cornish all are recognised as regional or minority languages by the european union under the european charter for regional or minority languages and the framework convention for the protection of national minorities as it is an eu member state this therefore obliges the uk government to provide them specific measures of protection and promotion in the 2001 census over a fifth 21 of the population of wales said they could speak welsh an increase from the 1991 census 18 in addition it is estimated that about 200000 welsh speakers live in england in the same census in northern ireland 167487 people 104 stated that they had some knowledge of irish see irish language in northern ireland almost exclusively in the nationalist mainly catholic population over 92000 people in scotland just under 2 of the population had some gaelic language ability including 72 of those living in the outer hebrides the number of schoolchildren being taught through welsh scottish gaelic and irish is increasing among emigrant-descended populations some scottish gaelic is still spoken in canada principally nova scotia and cape breton island and welsh in patagonia argentina scots a language descended from early northern middle english has limited recognition alongside its regional variant ulster scots in northern ireland without specific commitments to protection and promotion it is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in england french and german are the two most commonly taught second languages in england and scotland all pupils in wales are taught welsh as a second language up to age 16 or are taught in welsh religion forms of christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the united kingdom for over 1400 years although a majority of citizens still identify with christianity in many surveys regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths most notably islam this has led some commentators to variously describe the uk as a multi-faith secularised or post-christian society in the 2001 census 716 of all respondents indicated that they were christians with the next largest faiths being islam 28 hinduism 10 sikhism 06 judaism 05 buddhism 03 and all other religions 03 15 of respondents stated that they had no religion with a further 7 not stating a religious preference a tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten britons actually attend church weekly between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the number of people who identified as christian by 12 whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled this contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories with the number of muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 the muslim population has increased from 16 million in 2001 to 27 million in 2011 making it the second-largest religious group in the united kingdom in a 2016 survey conducted by bsa british social attitudes on religious affiliation 53 of respondents indicated no religion while 41 indicated they were christians followed by 6 who affiliated with other religions eg islam hinduism judaism etc among christians adherents to the church of england constituted 15 roman catholic church 9 other christians including presbyterians methodists other protestants as well as eastern orthodox 17 71 of young people aged 1824 said they had no religion the church of england is the established church in england it retains a representation in the uk parliament and the british monarch is its supreme governor in scotland the church of scotland is recognised as the national church it is not subject to state control and the british monarch is an ordinary member required to swear an oath to maintain and preserve the protestant religion and presbyterian church government upon his or her accession the church in wales was disestablished in 1920 and as the church of ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of ireland there is no established church in northern ireland although there are no uk-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual christian denominations it has been estimated that 62 of christians are anglican 135 catholic 6 presbyterian 34 methodist with small numbers of other protestant denominations such as plymouth brethren and orthodox churches migration the united kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration the great famine in ireland then part of the united kingdom resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to great britain throughout the 19th century a small population of german immigrants built up numbering 28644 in england and wales in 1861 london held around half of this population and other small communities existed in manchester bradford and elsewhere the german immigrant community was the largest group until 1891 when it became second to russian jews england has had small jewish communities for many centuries subject to occasional expulsions but british jews numbered fewer than 10000 at the start of the 19th century after 1881 russian jews suffered bitter persecutions and out of some 2000000 who left russia by 1914 around 120000 settled permanently in britain overtaking the germans to be the largest ethnic minority from outside the british isles the population had increased to 370000 by 1938 unable to return to poland at the end of the second world war over 120000 polish veterans remained in the uk permanently after the second world war there was significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former colonies many from the caribbean and indian subcontinent partly as a legacy of empire and partly driven by labour shortages in 1841 025 of the population of england and wales was born in a foreign country in 1901 15 of the population was foreign born by 1931 this figure had risen to 26 and by 1951 it was 44 in 2014 the net increase was 318000 immigration was 641000 up from 526000 in 2013 while the number of people emigrating for more than 12 months was 323000 one of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new eu member states in eastern europe known as the a8 countries citizens of the european union including those of the uk have the right to live and work in any eu member state the uk applied temporary restrictions to citizens of romania and bulgaria which joined the eu in january 2007 research conducted by the migration policy institute for the equality and human rights commission suggests that between may 2004 and september 2009 15million workers migrated from the new eu member states to the uk two-thirds of them polish but that many subsequently returned home resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the uk of some 700000 over that period the late-2000s recession in the uk reduced the economic incentive for poles to migrate to the uk the migration becoming temporary and circular in 2009 for the first time since enlargement more nationals of the eight central and eastern european states that had joined the eu in 2004 left the uk than arrived in 2011 citizens of the new eu member states made up 13 of the immigrants entering the country in 2010 there were 70 million foreign-born residents in the uk corresponding to 113 of the total population of these 476 million 77 were born outside the eu and 224 million 36 were born in another eu member state the proportion of foreign-born people in the uk remains slightly below that of many other european countries immigration is now contributing to a rising population with arrivals and uk-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 over a quarter 270 of live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the uk according to official statistics released in 2015 analysis of office for national statistics ons data shows that a net total of 23million migrants moved to the uk in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006 the ons reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 to 239000 in 2013 approximately 208000 foreign nationals were naturalised as british citizens the highest number since records began in 1962 this figure fell to around 125800 in 2014 between 2009 and 2013 the average number of people granted british citizenship per year was 195800 the main countries of previous nationality of those naturalised in 2014 were india pakistan the philippines nigeria bangladesh nepal china south africa poland and somalia the total number of grants of settlement which confers permanent residence in the uk without granting british citizenship was approximately 154700 in 2013 compared to 241200 in 2010 and 129800 in 2012 the british government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the european economic area to replace former schemes including the scottish governments fresh talent initiative in june 2010 the government introduced a temporary limit of 24000 on immigration from outside the eu aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in april 2011 emigration was an important feature of british society in the 19th century between 1815 and 1930 around 114million people emigrated from britain and 73million from ireland estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300million people of british and irish descent were permanently settled around the globe today at least 55million uk-born people live abroad mainly in australia spain the united states and canada education education in the united kingdom is a devolved matter with each country having a separate education system considering the four systems together about 38 per cent of the united kingdom
