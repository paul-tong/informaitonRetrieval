three-dimensional space also 3-space or rarely tri-dimensional space is a geometric setting in which three values called parameters are required to determine the position of an element ie point this is the informal meaning of the term dimension in physics and mathematics a sequence of n numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space when n 3 the set of all such locations is called three-dimensional euclidean space it is commonly represented by the symbol this serves as a three-parameter model of the physical universe that is the spatial part without considering time in which all known matter exists however this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called 3-manifolds in this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions coordinates any three directions can be chosen provided that vectors in these directions do not all lie in the same 2-space plane furthermore in this case these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms width height depth and length in euclidean geometry coordinate systems in mathematics analytic geometry also called cartesian geometry describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross they are usually labeled x y and z relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods see euclidean space below are images of the above-mentioned systems cartesian coordinate system cartesian coordinate system cylindrical coordinate system cylindrical coordinate system spherical coordinate system spherical coordinate system lines and planes two distinct points always determine a straight line three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire space two distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel do not meet three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel a line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line a hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection varignons theorem states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in form a parallelogram and so are coplanar spheres and balls a sphere in 3-space also called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance r from a central point p the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball or more precisely a 3-ball the volume of the ball is given by another type of sphere arises from a 4-ball whose three-dimensional surface is the 3-sphere points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space if a point has coordinates px y z w then x y z w 1 characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the origin polytopes in three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes the five convex platonic solids and the four nonconvex kepler-poinsot polyhedra surfaces of revolution a surface generated by revolving a plane curve about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular orthogonal to the axis is a circle simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex apex the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular cylinder quadric surfaces in analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namely where a b c f g h j k l and m are real numbers and not all of a b c f g and h are zero is called a quadric surface there are six types of non-degenerate quadric surfaces ellipsoid hyperboloid of one sheet hyperboloid of two sheets elliptic cone elliptic paraboloid hyperbolic paraboloid the degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder a surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane and all the lines of through that conic that are normal to elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as well both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family each family is called a regulus in linear algebra another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectors dot product angle and length a vector can be pictured as an arrow the vectors magnitude is its length and its direction is the direction the arrow points a vector in can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers these numbers are called the components of the vector the dot product of two vectors a a1 a2 a3 and b b1 b2 b3 is defined as the magnitude of a vector a is denoted by a the dot product of a vector a a1 a2 a3 with itself is which gives the formula for the euclidean length of the vector without reference to the components of the vectors the dot product of two non-zero euclidean vectors a and b is given by where is the angle between a and b cross product the cross product or vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space and is denoted by the symbol the cross product a b of the vectors a and b is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics physics and engineering the space and product form an algebra over a field which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracket one can in n dimensions take the product of n 1 vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions in calculus gradient divergence and curl in a rectangular coordinate system the gradient is given by the divergence of a continuously differentiable vector field f u i v j w k is equal to the scalar-valued function expanded in cartesian coordinates see del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations the curl f is for f composed of fx fy fz where i j and k are the unit vectors for the x- y- and z-axes respectively this expands as follows line integrals surface integrals and volume integrals for some scalar field f u r r the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c u is defined as where r a b c is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c and a b displaystyle ab for a vector field f u r r the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c u in the direction of r is defined as where is the dot product and r a b c is a bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces it can be thought of as the double integral analog of the line integral to find an explicit formula for the surface integral we need to parameterize the surface of interest s by considering a system of curvilinear coordinates on s like the latitude and longitude on a sphere let such a parameterization be xs t where s t varies in some region t in the plane then the surface integral is given by where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of xs t and is known as the surface element given a vector field v on s that is a function that assigns to each x in s a vector vx the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field the result is a vector a volume integral refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domain it can also mean a triple integral within a region d in r of a function f x y z displaystyle fxyz and is usually written as fundamental theorem of line integrals the fundamental theorem of line integrals says that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve let u r n r displaystyle varphi usubseteq mathbb r nto mathbb r then stokes theorem stokes theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field f over a surface in euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary divergence theorem suppose v is a subset of r n displaystyle mathbb r n in the case of n 3 v represents a volume in 3d space which is compact and has a piecewise smooth boundary s also indicated with v s if f is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of v then the divergence theorem says the left side is a volume integral over the volume v the right side is the surface integral over the boundary of the volume v the closed manifold v is quite generally the boundary of v oriented by outward-pointing normals and n is the outward pointing unit normal field of the boundary v ds may be used as a shorthand for nds in topology three-dimensional space has a number of topological properties that distinguish it from spaces of other dimension numbers for example at least three dimensions are required to tie a knot in a piece of string with the space r 3 displaystyle scriptstyle mathbb r 3 the topologists locally model all other 3-manifolds
