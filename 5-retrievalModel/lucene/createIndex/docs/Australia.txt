smaller islands it is the largest country in oceania and the worlds sixth-largest country by total area the neighbouring countries are papua new guinea indonesia and east timor to the north the solomon islands and vanuatu to the north-east and new zealand to the south-east the population of 25 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard australias capital is canberra and its largest city is sydney the countrys other major metropolitan areas are melbourne brisbane perth and adelaide australia was inhabited by indigenous australians for about 60000 years before the first british settlement in the late 18th century it is documented that aborigines spoke languages that can be classified into about 250 groups after the european exploration of the continent by dutch explorers in 1606 who named it new holland australias eastern half was claimed by great britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of new south wales from 26 january 1788 a date which became australias national day the population grew steadily in subsequent decades and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established on 1 january 1901 the six colonies federated forming the commonwealth of australia australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and ten territories being the oldest flattest and driest inhabited continent with the least fertile soils australia has a landmass of 7617930 square kilometres 2941300sqmi a megadiverse country its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes with deserts in the centre tropical rainforests in the north-east and mountain ranges in the south-east a gold rush began in australia in the early 1850s which boosted the population of the country nevertheless its population density 28 inhabitants per square kilometre remains among the lowest in the world australia generates its income from various sources including mining-related exports telecommunications banking and manufacturing indigenous australian rock art is the oldest and richest in the world dating as far back as 60000 years and spread across hundreds of thousands of sites australia is a highly developed country with the worlds 13th-largest

united nations g20 commonwealth of nations anzus organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd world trade organization asia-pacific economic cooperation pacific islands forum and the asean plus six mechanism name the name australia pronounced streli in australian english is derived from the latin terra australis southern land a name used for a hypothetical continent in the southern hemisphere since ancient times when europeans first began visiting and mapping australia in the 17th century the name terra australis was naturally applied to the new territories until the early 19th century australia was best known as new holland a name first applied by the dutch explorer abel tasman in 1644 as nieuw-holland and subsequently anglicised terra australis still saw occasional usage such as in scientific texts the name australia was popularised by the explorer matthew flinders who said it was more agreeable to the ear and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth the first time that australia appears to have been officially used was in april 1817 when governor lachlan macquarie acknowledged the receipt of flinders charts of australia from lord bathurst in december 1817 macquarie recommended to the colonial office that it be formally adopted in 1824 the admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name the first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of the australia directory by the hydrographic office colloquial names for australia include oz and the land down under usually shortened to just down under other epithets include the great southern land the lucky country the sunburnt country and the wide brown land the latter two both derive from dorothea mackellars 1908 poem my country history pre-colonial history human habitation of the australian continent is estimated to have begun around 65000 to 70000 years ago with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now southeast asia these first inhabitants were the ancestors of modern indigenous australians aboriginal australian culture is one of the oldest continual civilizations on earth at the time of first european contact most indigenous australians were hunter-gatherers with complex economies and societies recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750000 could have been sustained indigenous australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the dreamtime the torres strait islanders ethnically melanesian obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas the northern coasts and waters of australia were visited sporadically by makassan fishermen from south peninsula sulawesi european arrival the first recorded european sighting of the australian mainland and the first recorded european landfall on the australian continent in 1606 are attributed to the dutch the first ship and crew to chart the australian coast and meet with aboriginal people was the duyfken captained by dutch navigator willem janszoon he sighted the coast of cape york peninsula in early 1606 and made landfall on 26 february at the pennefather river near the modern town of weipa on cape york later that year spanish explorer lus vaz de torres sailed through and navigated torres strait islands the dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent new holland during the 17th century but made no attempt at settlement william dampier an english explorer and privateer landed on the north-west coast of new holland in 1688 and again in 1699 on a return trip in 1770 james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named new south wales and claimed for great britain with the loss of its american colonies in 1783 the british government sent a fleet of ships the first fleet under the command of captain arthur phillip to establish a new penal colony in new south wales a camp was set up and the flag raised at sydney cove port jackson on 26 january 1788 a date which became australias national day australia day a british settlement was established in van diemens land now known as tasmania in 1803 and it became a separate colony in 1825 the united kingdom formally claimed the western part of western australia the swan river colony in 1828 separate colonies were carved from parts of new south wales south australia in 1836 victoria in 1851 and queensland in 1859 the northern territory was founded in 1911 when it was excised from south australia south australia was founded as a free province it was never a penal colony victoria and western australia were also founded free but later accepted transported convicts a campaign by the settlers of new south wales led to the end of convict transportation to that colony the last convict ship arrived in 1848 the indigenous population estimated to have been between 750000 and 1000000 in 1788 declined for 150 years following settlement mainly due to infectious disease thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers a government policy of assimilation beginning with the aboriginal protection act 1869 resulted in the removal of many aboriginal children from their families and communities often referred to as the stolen generations a practice which may also have contributed to the decline in the indigenous population as a result of the 1967 referendum the federal governments power to enact special laws with respect to a particular race was extended to enable the making of laws with respect to aborigines traditional ownership of land native title was not recognised in law until 1992 when the high court of australia held in mabo v queensland no 2 that the legal doctrine that australia had been terra nullius land belonging to no one did not apply to australia at the time of british settlement colonial expansion in 1813 gregory blaxland william lawson and william wentworth succeeded in crossing the formidable barrier of forested gulleys and sheer cliffs presented by the blue mountains west of sydney in 1824 hamilton hume and former royal navy captain william hovell led an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony and also to find an answer to the mystery of where new south wales western rivers flowed in 1826 the british claim was extended to the whole australian continent when major edmund lockyer established a settlement on king george sound the basis of the later town of albany by 1850 large areas of the inland were still unknown to europeans trailblazers like edmund kennedy and the prussian naturalist ludwig leichhardt had met tragic ends attempting to fill in the gaps during the 1840s but explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answer scientific enquiries a gold rush began in australia in the early 1850s and the eureka rebellion against mining licence fees in 1854 was an early expression of civil disobedience between 1855 and 1890 the six colonies individually gained responsible government managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire the colonial office in london retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs defence and international shipping nationhood on 1 january 1901 federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning consultation and voting this established the commonwealth of australia as a dominion of the british empire the federal capital territory later renamed the australian capital territory was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of canberra melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while canberra was being constructed the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the federal parliament in 1911 in 1914 australia joined britain in fighting world war i with support from both the outgoing commonwealth liberal party and the incoming australian labor party australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the western front of about 416000 who served about 60000 were killed and another 152000 were wounded many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps anzacs at gallipoli as the birth of the nation its first major military action the kokoda track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during world war ii britains statute of westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the uk australia adopted it in 1942 but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the australian parliament during world war ii the shock of the united kingdoms defeat in asia in 1942 and the threat of japanese invasion caused australia to turn to the united states as a new ally and protector since 1951 australia has been a formal military ally of the us under the anzus treaty after world war ii australia encouraged immigration from mainland europe since the 1970s and following the abolition of the white australia policy immigration from asia and elsewhere was also promoted as a result australias demography culture and self-image were transformed the passing of the australia act 1986 ended all possibility for any vestigial role of the british government in the government in australia and removed the already seldom-used option of judicial appeals to the privy council in london in a 1999 referendum 55 of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two-thirds vote in both houses of the australian parliament since the publication of the landmark critique the lucky country 1964 by donald horne and the election of the whitlam government in 1972 there has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other pacific rim nations while maintaining close ties with australias traditional allies and trading partners geography general characteristics surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans australia is separated from asia by the arafura and timor seas with the coral sea lying off the queensland coast and the tasman sea lying between australia and new zealand the worlds smallest continent and sixth largest country by total area australia owing to its size and isolation is often dubbed the island continent and is sometimes considered the worlds largest island australia has 34218 kilometres 21262mi of coastline excluding all offshore islands and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8148250 square kilometres 3146060sqmi this exclusive economic zone does not include the australian antarctic territory apart from macquarie island australia lies between latitudes 9 and 44s and longitudes 112 and 154e the great barrier reef the worlds largest coral reef lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2000 kilometres 1240mi mount augustus claimed to be the worlds largest monolith is located in western australia at 2228 metres 7310ft mount kosciuszko on the great dividing range is the highest mountain on the australian mainland even taller are mawson peak at 2745 metres or 9006 feet on the remote australian external territory of heard island and in the australian antarctic territory mount mcclintock and mount menzies at 3492 metres 11457ft and 3355 metres 11007ft respectively australias size gives it a wide variety of landscapes with tropical rainforests in the north-east mountain ranges in the south-east south-west and east and dry desert in the centre the desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land australia is the driest inhabited continent its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500mm the population density 28 inhabitants per square kilometre is among the lowest in the world although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline eastern australia is marked by the great dividing range which runs parallel to the coast of queensland new south wales and much of victoria the name is not strictly accurate because parts of the range consist of low hills and the highlands are typically no more than 1600 metres 5249ft in height the coastal uplands and a belt of brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland these include the western plains of new south wales and the einasleigh uplands barkly tableland and mulga lands of inland queensland the northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested cape york peninsula the landscapes of the top end and the gulf country with their tropical climate include forest woodland wetland grassland rainforest and desert at the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of the kimberley and below that the pilbara to the south of these and inland lie more areas of grassland the ord victoria plain and the western australian mulga shrublands at the heart of the country are the uplands of central australia prominent features of the centre and south include uluru also known as ayers rock the famous sandstone monolith and the inland simpson tirari and sturt stony gibson great sandy tanami and great victoria deserts with the famous nullarbor plain on the southern coast geology lying on the indo-australian plate the mainland of australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on earth with a relatively stable geological history the landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 38 billion years of the earths history the pilbara craton is one of only two pristine archaean 3627 ga billion years ago crusts identified on the earth having been part of all major supercontinents the australian continent began to form after the breakup of gondwana in the permian with the separation of the continental landmass from the african continent and indian subcontinent it separated from antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the permian and continuing through to the cretaceous when the last glacial period ended in about 10000 bc rising sea levels formed bass strait separating tasmania from the mainland then between about 8000 and 6500 bc the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea separating new guinea the aru islands and the mainland of australia the australian continent is currently moving toward eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year the australian mainlands continental crust excluding the thinned margins has an average thickness of 38km with a range in thickness from 24km to 59km australias geology can be divided into several main sections showcasing that the continent grew from west to east the archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west proterozoic fold belts in the centre and phanerozoic sedimentary basins metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east the australian mainland and tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and currently have no active volcanoes but due to passing over the east australia hotspot recent volcanism has occurred during the holocene in the newer volcanics province of western victoria and southeastern south australia volcanism also occurs in the island of new guinea considered geologically as part of the australian continent and in the australian external territory of heard island and mcdonald islands seismic activity in the australian mainland and tasmania is also low with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 newcastle earthquake climate the climate of australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents including the indian ocean dipole and the el niosouthern oscillation which is correlated with periodic drought and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern australia these factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year much of the northern part of the country has a tropical predominantly summer-rainfall monsoon the south-west corner of the country has a mediterranean climate the south-east ranges from oceanic tasmania and coastal victoria to humid subtropical upper half of new south wales with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates the interior is arid to semi-arid according to the bureau of meteorologys 2011 australian climate statement australia had lower than average temperatures in 2011 as a consequence of a la nia weather pattern however the countrys 10-year average continues to demonstrate the rising trend in temperatures with 20022011 likely to rank in the top two warmest 10-year periods on record for australia at 052c 094f above the long-term average furthermore 2014 was australias third warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910 water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought throughout much of the continent major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought flushing out inland river systems overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains as occurred throughout eastern australia in 2010 2011 and 2012 after the 2000s australian drought australias carbon dioxide emissions per capita are among the highest in the world lower than those of only a few other industrialised nations a carbon tax was introduced in 2012 and helped to reduce australias emissions but was scrapped in 2014 under the liberal government since the carbon tax was repealed emissions have again continued to rise january 2019 was the hottest month ever in australia average temperatures exceeding 30c 86f caused bushfires deaths of wild animals and inland fish and a rise in hospital admissions biodiversity although most of australia is semi-arid or desert it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests fungi typify that diversity an estimated 250000 speciesof which only 5 have been described occur in australia because of the continents great age extremely variable weather patterns and long-term geographic isolation much of australias biota is unique about 85 of flowering plants 84 of mammals more than 45 of birds and 89 of in-shore temperate-zone fish are endemic australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country with 755 species besides antarctica australia is the only continent that developed without feline species feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by dutch shipwrecks and later in the 18th century by european settlers they are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts among well-known australian animals are the monotremes the platypus and echidna a host of marsupials including the kangaroo koala and wombat and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world the dingo was introduced by austronesian people who traded with indigenous australians around 3000 bce many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement including the australian megafauna others have disappeared since european settlement among them the thylacine many of australias ecoregions and the species within those regions are threatened by human activities and introduced animal chromistan fungal and plant species all these factors have led to australias having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world the federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species numerous protected areas have been created under the national strategy for the conservation of australias biological diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems 65 wetlands are listed under the ramsar convention and 16 natural world heritage sites have been established australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 environmental performance index government and politics australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with elizabeth ii at its apex as the queen of australia a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other commonwealth realms the queen is represented in australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level who by convention act on the advice of her ministers thus in practice the governor-general has no actual decision-making or de facto governmental role and merely acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the federal executive council the governor-general does have extraordinary reserve powers which may be exercised outside the prime ministers request in rare and limited circumstances the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of 1975 the federal government is separated into three branches legislature the bicameral parliament defined in section 1 of the constitution as comprising the queen represented by the governor-general the senate and the house of representatives executive the federal executive council which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet comprising the prime minister and ministers of state who advise the governor-general judiciary the high court of australia and other federal courts whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of the federal executive council in the senate the upper house there are 76 senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories the australian capital territory and the northern territory the house of representatives the lower house has 150 members elected from single-member electoral divisions commonly known as electorates or seats allocated to states on the basis of population with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house thus only 40 of the 76 places in the senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution australias electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of tasmania and the act which along with the senate and most state upper houses combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction as is enrolment with the exception of south australia the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister in cases where no party has majority support the governor-general has the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and if necessary dismiss one that has lost the confidence of parliament there are two major political groups that usually form government federally and in the states the australian labor party and the coalition which is a formal grouping of the liberal party and its minor partner the national party within australian political culture the coalition is considered centre-right and the labor party is considered centre-left independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in australian parliaments mostly in upper houses in september 2015 malcolm turnbull successfully challenged tony abbott for leadership of the coalition and was sworn in as the 29th prime minister of australia the most recent federal election was held on 2 july 2016 and resulted in the coalitions forming a majority government on 24 august 2018 turnbull resigned after his party voted for a leadership spill treasurer scott morrison was elected as party leader and was sworn in as prime minister later that day states and territories australia has six states new south wales nsw queensland qld south australia sa tasmania tas victoria vic and western australia wa and two major mainland territories the australian capital territory act and the northern territory nt in most respects these two territories function as states except that the commonwealth parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments under the constitution the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject whereas the commonwealth federal parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51 for example state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education criminal law and state police health transport and local government but the commonwealth parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas however commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency in addition the commonwealth has the power to levy income tax which coupled with the power to make grants to states has given it the financial means to incentivise states to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the commonwealth does not have legislative power each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament unicameral in the northern territory the act and queensland and bicameral in the other states the states are sovereign entities although subject to certain powers of the commonwealth as defined by the constitution the lower houses are known as the legislative assembly the house of assembly in south australia and tasmania the upper houses are known as the legislative council the head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister the queen is represented in each state by a governor and in the northern territory the administrator in the commonwealth the queens representative is the governor-general the commonwealth parliament also directly administers the following external territories ashmore and cartier islands australian antarctic territory christmas island cocos keeling islands coral sea islands heard island and mcdonald islands and jervis bay territory a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of new south wales the external territory of norfolk island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the norfolk island act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an administrator to represent the queen in 2015 the commonwealth parliament abolished self-government integrating norfolk island into the australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council macquarie island is administered by tasmania and lord howe island by new south wales foreign relations over recent decades australias foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the united states through the anzus pact and by a desire to develop relationships with asia and the pacific particularly through asean and the pacific islands forum in 2005 australia secured an inaugural seat at the east asia summit following its accession to the treaty of amity and cooperation in southeast asia and in 2011 attended the sixth east asia summit in indonesia australia is a member of the commonwealth of nations in which the commonwealth heads of government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation it led the formation of the cairns group and asia-pacific economic cooperation australia is a member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the world trade organization and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements most recently the australiaunited states free trade agreement and closer economic relations with new zealand with another free trade agreement being negotiated with china the australiachina free trade agreement and japan south korea in 2011 australiachile free trade agreement and as of november2015 has put the trans-pacific partnership before parliament for ratification australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring new zealand with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the trans-tasman travel arrangement and free trade under the australianew zealand closer economic relations trade agreement new zealand canada and the united kingdom are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by australian people sharing a number of close diplomatic military and cultural ties with australia there is considerable public and political support to extend the trans-tasman travel arrangement and closer economic relations agreement to include canada and the united kingdom under a proposal known by the acronym canzuk with 73 of australian residents stating that they would endorse the proposition in principle along with new zealand the united kingdom malaysia and singapore australia is party to the five power defence arrangements a regional defence agreement a founding member

billion 20 of gdp in 2010 australia has among the highest house prices and some of the highest household debt levels in the world an emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactured goods has underpinned a significant increase in australias terms of trade since the start of the 21st century due to rising commodity prices australia has a balance of payments that is more than 7 of gdp negative and has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years australia has grown at an average annual rate of 36 for over 15 years in comparison to the oecd annual average of 25 australia was the only advanced economy not to experience a recession due to the global financial downturn in 20082009 however the economies of six of australias major trading partners have been in recession which in turn has affected australia significantly hampering its economic growth in recent years from 2012 to early 2013 australias national economy grew but some non-mining states and australias non-mining economy experienced a recession the hawke government floated the australian dollar in 1983 and partially deregulated the financial system the howard government followed with a partial deregulation of the labour market and the further privatisation of state-owned businesses most notably in the telecommunications industry the indirect tax system was substantially changed in july 2000 with the introduction of a 10 goods and services tax gst in australias tax system personal and company income tax are the main sources of government revenue as of september2018 there were 12640800 people employed either full- or part-time with an unemployment rate of 52 data released in mid-november 2013 showed that the number of welfare recipients had grown by 55 in 2007 228621 newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered a total that increased to 646414 in march 2013 according to the graduate careers survey full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from various occupations has declined since 2011 but it increases for graduates three years after graduation since 2008 inflation has typically been 23 and the base interest rate 56 the service sector of the economy including tourism education and financial services accounts for about 70 of gdp rich in natural resources australia is a major exporter of agricultural products particularly wheat and wool minerals such as iron-ore and gold and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal although agriculture and natural resources account for only 3 and 5 of gdp respectively they contribute substantially to export performance australias largest export markets are japan china the us south korea and new zealand australia is the worlds fourth largest exporter of wine and the wine industry contributes a55 billion per year to the nations economy demographics until the second world war the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the british isles and a majority of australians have some british or irish ancestry these australians form an ethnic group known as anglo-celtic australians in the 2016 australian census the most commonly nominated ancestries were english 361 australian 335 irish 110 scottish 93 chinese 56 italian 46 german 45 indian 28 greek 18 and dutch 16 australias population has quadrupled since the end of world war i much of this increase from immigration following world war ii and through to 2000 almost 59 million new immigrants arrived and settled in the country most immigrants are skilled but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees by 2050 australias population is currently projected to reach around 42 million in 2016 more than a quarter 26 of australias population were born
