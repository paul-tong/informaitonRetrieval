a space elevator is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system the main component would be a cable also called a tether anchored to the surface and extending into space the design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface such as the earths directly into space or orbit without the use of large rockets an earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond geostationary orbit 35786km altitude the competing forces of gravity which is stronger at the lower end and the outwardupward centrifugal force which is stronger at the upper end would result in the cable being held up under tension and stationary over a single position on earth with the tether deployed climbers could repeatedly climb the tether to space by mechanical means releasing their cargo to orbit climbers could also descend the tether to return cargo to the surface from orbit the concept of a tower reaching geosynchronous orbit was first published in 1895 by konstantin tsiolkovsky his proposal was for a free-standing tower reaching from the surface of earth to the height of geostationary orbit like all buildings tsiolkovskys structure would be under compression supporting its weight from below since 1959 most ideas for space elevators have focused on purely tensile structures with the weight of the system held up from above by centrifugal forces in the tensile concepts a space tether reaches from a large mass the counterweight beyond geostationary orbit to the ground this structure is held in tension between earth and the counterweight like an upside-down plumb bob to construct a space elevator on earth the cable material would need to be both stronger and lighter have greater specific strength than any known material development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement must happen before designs can progress beyond discussion stage carbon nanotubes cnts have been identified as possibly being able to meet the specific strength requirements for an earth space elevator other materials considered have been boron nitride nanotubes and diamond nanothreads which were first constructed in 2014 in 2018 single-crystal graphene was also proposed as a potential material a prototype was launched in 2018 to tether to future stations as well as the international space station it is a miniature version to be further examined before making the decision to build up a large structure in the coming years the concept is applicable to other planets and celestial bodies for locations in the solar system with weaker gravity than earths such as the moon or mars the strength-to-density requirements for tether materials are not as problematic currently available materials such as kevlar are strong and light enough that they could be practical as the tether material for elevators there history early concepts the key concept of the space elevator appeared in 1895 when russian scientist konstantin tsiolkovsky was inspired by the eiffel tower in paris he considered a similar tower that reached all the way into space and was built from the ground up to the altitude of 35786 kilometers the height of geostationary orbit he noted that the top of such a tower would be circling earth as in a geostationary orbit objects would attain horizontal velocity as they rode up the tower and an object released at the towers top would have enough horizontal velocity to remain there in geostationary orbit tsiolkovskys conceptual tower was a compression structure while modern concepts call for a tensile structure or tether 20th century building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions in 1959 another russian scientist yuri n artsutanov suggested a more feasible proposal artsutanov suggested using a geostationary satellite as the base from which to deploy the structure downward by using a counterweight a cable would be lowered from geostationary orbit to the surface of earth while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from earth keeping the cable constantly over the same spot on the surface of the earth artsutanovs idea was introduced to the russian-speaking public in an interview published in the sunday supplement of komsomolskaya pravda in 1960 but was not available in english until much later he also proposed tapering the cable thickness so that the stress in the cable was constant this gave a thinner cable at ground level that became thickest at the level of geostationary orbit both the tower and cable ideas were proposed in the quasi-humorous ariadne column in new scientist december 24 1964 in 1966 isaacs vine bradner and bachus four american engineers reinvented the concept naming it a sky-hook and published their analysis in the journal science they decided to determine what type of material would be required to build a space elevator assuming it would be a straight cable with no variations in its cross section and found that the strength required would be twice that of any then-existing material including graphite quartz and diamond in 1975 an american scientist jerome pearson reinvented the concept yet again publishing his analysis in the journal acta astronautica he designed a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator the completed cable would be thickest at the geostationary orbit where the tension was greatest and would be narrowest at the tips to reduce the amount of weight per unit area of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear he suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to 144000 kilometers 89000 miles almost half the distance to the moon as the lower section of the elevator was built without a large counterweight the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way gravitational and centrifugal forces change with distance from earth his analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the moon wind and moving payloads up and down the cable the weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of space shuttle trips although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from asteroidal or lunar ore after the development of carbon nanotubes in the 1990s engineer david smitherman of nasamarshalls advanced projects office realized that the high strength of these materials might make the concept of a space elevator feasible and put together a workshop at the marshall space flight center inviting many scientists and engineers to discuss concepts and compile plans for an elevator to turn the concept into a reality in 2000 another american scientist bradley c edwards suggested creating a 100000km 62000mi long paper-thin ribbon using a carbon nanotube composite material he chose the wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape rather than earlier circular cross-section concepts because that shape would stand a greater chance of surviving impacts by meteoroids the ribbon cross-section shape also provided large surface area for climbers to climb with simple rollers supported by the nasa institute for advanced concepts edwards work was expanded to cover the deployment scenario climber design power delivery system orbital debris avoidance anchor system surviving atomic oxygen avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial pacific construction costs construction schedule and environmental hazards 21st century to speed space elevator development proponents have organized several competitions similar to the ansari x prize for relevant technologies among them are elevator2010 which organized annual competitions for climbers ribbons and power-beaming systems from 2005 to 2009 the robogames space elevator ribbon climbing competition as well as nasas centennial challenges program which in march 2005 announced a partnership with the spaceward foundation the operator of elevator2010 raising the total value of prizes to us400000 the first european space elevator challenge eusec to establish a climber structure took place in august 2011 in 2005 the liftport group of space elevator companies announced that it will be building a carbon nanotube manufacturing plant in millville new jersey to supply various glass plastic and metal companies with these strong materials although liftport hopes to eventually use carbon nanotubes in the construction of a 100000km 62000mi space elevator this move will allow it to make money in the short term and conduct research and development into new production methods their announced goal was a space elevator launch in 2010 on february 13 2006 the liftport group announced that earlier the same month they had tested a mile of space-elevator tether made of carbon-fiber composite strings and fiberglass tape measuring 5cm 20in wide and 1mm approx 13 sheets of paper thick lifted with balloons in 2007 elevator2010 held the 2007 space elevator games which featured us500000 awards for each of the two competitions 1000000 total as well as an additional 4000000 to be awarded over the next five years for space elevator related technologies no teams won the competition but a team from mit entered the first 2-gram 007oz 100-percent carbon nanotube entry into the competition japan held an international conference in november 2008 to draw up a timetable for building the elevator in 2008 the book leaving the planet by space elevator by dr brad edwards and philip ragan was published in japanese and entered the japanese best-seller list this led to shuichi ono chairman of the japan space elevator association unveiling a space-elevator plan putting forth what observers considered an extremely low cost estimate of a trillion yen 5 billion 8 billion to build one in 2012 the obayashi corporation announced that in 38 years it could build a space elevator using carbon nanotube technology at 200 kilometers per hour the designs 30-passenger climber would be able to reach the geo level after a 75 day trip no cost estimates finance plans or other specifics were made this along with timing and other factors hinted that the announcement was made largely to provide publicity for the opening of one of the companys other projects in tokyo in 2013 the international academy of astronautics published a technological feasibility assessment which concluded that the critical capability improvement needed was the tether material which was projected to achieve the necessary strength-to-weight ratio within 20 years the four-year long study looked into many facets of space elevator development including missions development schedules financial investments revenue flow and benefits it was reported that it would be possible to operationally survive smaller impacts and avoid larger impacts with meteors and space debris and that the estimated cost of lifting a kilogram of payload to geo and beyond would be 500 in 2014 google xs rapid evaluation rd team began the design of a space elevator eventually finding that no one had yet manufactured a perfectly formed carbon nanotube strand longer than a meter they thus decided to put the project in deep freeze and also keep tabs on any advances in the carbon nanotube field in 2018 researchers at japans shizuoka university launched stars-me two cubesats connected by a tether which a mini-elevator will travel on the prototype was launched as a test bed for a larger structure in fiction in 1979 space elevators were introduced to a broader audience with the simultaneous publication of arthur c clarkes novel the fountains of paradise in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of taprobane loosely based on sri lanka albeit moved south to the equator and charles sheffields first novel the web between the worlds also featuring the building of a space elevator three years later in robert a heinleins 1982 novel friday the principal character makes use of the nairobi beanstalk in the course of her travels in kim stanley robinsons 1993 novel red mars colonists build a space elevator on mars that allows both for more colonists to arrive and also for natural resources mined there to be able to leave for earth in david gerrolds 2000 novel jumping off the planet a family excursion up the ecuador beanstalk is actually a child-custody kidnapping gerrolds book also examines some of the industrial applications of a mature elevator technology in a biological version joan slonczewskis 2011 novel the highest frontier depicts a college student ascending a space elevator constructed of self-healing cables of anthrax bacilli the engineered bacteria can regrow the cables when severed by space debris physics apparent gravitational field an earth space elevator cable rotates along with the rotation of the earth therefore the cable and objects attached to it would experience upward centrifugal force in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force the higher up the cable the object is located the less the gravitational pull of the earth and the stronger the upward centrifugal force due to the rotation so that more centrifugal force opposes less gravity the centrifugal force and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit geo above geo the centrifugal force is stronger than gravity causing objects attached to the cable there to pull upward on it the net force for objects attached to the cable is called the apparent gravitational field the apparent gravitational field for attached objects is the downward gravity minus the upward centrifugal force the apparent gravity experienced by an object on the cable is zero at geo downward below geo and upward above geo the apparent gravitational field can be represented this way where at some point up the cable the two terms downward gravity and upward centrifugal force are equal and opposite objects fixed to the cable at that point put no weight on the cable this altitude r1 depends on the mass of the planet and its rotation rate setting actual gravity equal to centrifugal acceleration gives on earth this distance is 35786km 22236mi above the surface the altitude of geostationary orbit on the cable below geostationary orbit downward gravity would be greater than the upward centrifugal force so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable downward any object released from the cable below that level would initially accelerate downward along the cable then gradually it would deflect eastward from the cable on the cable above the level of stationary orbit upward centrifugal force would be greater than downward gravity so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable upward any object released from the cable above the geosynchronous level would initially accelerate upward along the cable then gradually it would deflect westward from the cable cable section historically the main technical problem has been considered the ability of the cable to hold up with tension the weight of itself below any given point the greatest tension on a space elevator cable is at the point of geostationary orbit 35786km 22236mi above the earths equator this means that the cable material combined with its design must be strong enough to hold up its own weight from the surface up to 35786km 22236mi a cable which is thicker in cross section at that height than at the surface could better hold up its own weight over a longer length how the cross section area tapers from the maximum at 35786km 22236mi to the minimum at the surface is therefore an important design factor for a space elevator cable to maximize the usable excess strength for a given amount of cable material the cables cross section area would need to be designed for the most part in such a way that the stress ie the tension per unit of cross sectional area is constant along the length of the cable the constant-stress criterion is a starting point in the design of the cable cross section as it changes with altitude other factors considered in more detailed designs include thickening at altitudes where more space junk is present consideration of the point stresses imposed by climbers and the use of varied materials to account for these and other factors modern detailed cross section designs seek to achieve the largest safety margin possible with as little variation over altitude and time as possible in simple starting-point designs that equates to constant-stress in the constant-stress case the cross-section follows this differential equation or or where the value of g is given by the first equation which yields the variation being taken between r0 ground and r1 geostationary between these two points this quantity can be expressed as or where x 2 r 0 g 0 00035 displaystyle xomega 2r0g0thicksim 00035 is the ratio between the centrifugal force on the equator and the gravitational force cable material to compare materials the specific strength of the material for the space elevator can be expressed in terms of the characteristic length or free breaking length the length of an un-tapered cylindrical cable at which it will break under its own weight under constant gravity for a given material that length is l c g 0 textstyle lcsigma rho cdot g0 where textstyle sigma textstyle rho and g 0 textstyle g0 are as defined above the free breaking length needed is given by the equation where x w 2 r 0 g 0 displaystyle xw2cdot r0g0 if one does not take into account the x factor which reduces the strength needed by about 30 percent this equation also says that the section ratio equals e or e 1 displaystyle e1 when if the material can support a free breaking length of only one tenth this the section needed at a geosynchronous orbit will be e 10 textstyle e10 a factor of 220265 times the ground section structure there are a variety of space elevator designs proposed for many planetary bodies almost every design includes a base station a cable climbers and a counterweight for an earth space elevator the earths rotation creates upward centrifugal force on the counterweight the counterweight is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the counterweight the base station anchors the whole system to the surface of the earth climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo base station modern concepts for the base stationanchor are typically mobile stations large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms mobile base stations would have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts with land-based anchors by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds storms and space debris oceanic anchor points are also typically in international waters simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station stationary land based platforms would have simpler and less costly logistical access to the base they also would have an advantage of being able to be at high altitude such as on top of mountains in an alternate concept the base station could be a tower forming a space elevator which comprises both a compression tower close to the surface and a tether structure at higher altitudes combining a compression structure with a tension structure would reduce loads from the atmosphere at the earth end of the tether and reduce the distance into the earths gravity field the cable needs to extend and thus reduce the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material all other design factors being equal cable a space elevator cable would need to carry its own weight as well as the additional weight of climbers the required strength of the cable would vary along its length this is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above maximum tension on a space elevator cable would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches earth any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor the ratio between the cables radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the earths surface the cable would need to be made of a material with a large tensile strengthdensity ratio for example the edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a tensile strength of at least 100 gigapascals since edwards consistently assumed the density of his carbon nanotube cable to be 1300 kgm3 that implies a specific strength of 77 megapascalkgm3 this value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator an untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of 4960 kilometers 3080mi of its own weight at sea level to reach a geostationary altitude of 35786km 22236mi without yielding therefore a material with very high strength and lightness is needed for comparison metals like titanium steel or aluminium alloys have breaking lengths of only 2030km modern fibre materials such as kevlar fibreglass and carbongraphite fibre have breaking lengths of 100400km nanoengineered materials such as carbon nanotubes and more recently discovered graphene ribbons perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon are expected to have breaking lengths of 50006000km at sea level and also are able to conduct electrical power for a space elevator on earth with its comparatively high gravity the cable material would need to be stronger and lighter than currently available materials for this reason there has been a focus on the development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement for high specific strength carbon has advantages because it is only the 6th element in the periodic table carbon has comparatively few of the protons and neutrons which contribute most of the dead weight of any material most of the interatomic bonding forces of any element are contributed by only the outer few electrons for carbon the strength and stability of those bonds is high compared to the mass of the atom the challenge in using carbon nanotubes remains to extend to macroscopic sizes the production of such material that are still perfect on the microscopic scale as microscopic defects are most responsible for material weakness as of 2014 carbon nanotube technology allowed growing tubes up to a few tenths of meters in 2014 diamond nanothreads were first synthesized since they have strength properties similar to carbon nanotubes diamond nanothreads were quickly seen as candidate cable material as well climbers a space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense with moving cables due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips while various designs employing moving cables have been proposed most cable designs call for the elevator to climb up a stationary cable climbers cover a wide range of designs on elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons most propose to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction climbers would need to be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput lighter climbers could be sent up more often with several going up at the same time this would increase throughput somewhat but would lower the mass of each individual payload the horizontal speed ie due to orbital rotation of each part of the cable increases with altitude proportional to distance from the center of the earth reaching low orbital speed at a point approximately 66 percent of the height between the surface and geostationary orbit or a height of about 23400km a payload released at this point would go into a highly eccentric elliptical orbit staying just barely clear from atmospheric reentry with the periapsis at the same altitude as leo and the apoapsis at the release height with increasing release height the orbit would become less eccentric as both periapsis and apoapsis increase becoming circular at geostationary level when the payload has reached geo the horizontal speed is exactly the speed of a circular orbit at that level so that if released it would remain adjacent to that point on the cable the payload can also continue climbing further up the cable beyond geo allowing it to obtain higher speed at jettison if released from 100000km the payload would have enough speed to reach the asteroid belt as a payload is lifted up a space elevator it would gain not only altitude but horizontal speed angular momentum as well the angular momentum is taken from the earths rotation as the climber ascends it is initially moving slower than each successive part of cable it is moving on to this is the coriolis force the climber drags westward on the cable as it climbs and slightly decreases the earths rotation speed the opposite process would occur for descending payloads the cable is tilted eastward thus slightly increasing earths rotation speed the overall effect of the centrifugal force acting on the cable would cause it to constantly try to return to the energetically favorable vertical orientation so after an object has been lifted on the cable the counterweight would swing back toward the vertical like an inverted pendulum space elevators and their loads would be designed so that the center of mass is always well-enough above the level of geostationary orbit to hold up the whole system lift and descent operations would need to be carefully planned so as to keep the pendulum-like motion of the counterweight around the tether point under control climber speed would be limited by the coriolis force available power and by the need to ensure the climbers accelerating force does not break the cable climbers would also need to maintain a minimum average speed in order to move material up and down economically and expeditiously at the speed of a very fast car or train of 300kmh 190mph it will take about 5 days to climb to geosynchronous orbit powering climbers both power and energy are significant issues for climbersthe climbers would need to gain a large amount of potential energy as quickly as possible to clear the cable for the next payload various methods have been proposed to get that energy to the climber transfer the energy to the climber through wireless energy transfer while it is climbing transfer the energy to the climber through some material structure while it is climbing store the energy in the climber before it starts requires an extremely high specific energy such as nuclear energy solar power after the first 40km it is possible to use solar energy to power the climber wireless energy transfer such as laser power beaming is currently considered the most likely method using megawatt powered free electron or solid state lasers in combination with adaptive mirrors approximately 10m 33ft wide and a photovoltaic array on the climber tuned to the laser frequency for efficiency for climber designs powered by power beaming this efficiency is an important design goal unused energy would need to be re-radiated away with heat-dissipation systems which add to weight yoshio aoki a professor of precision machinery engineering at nihon university and director of the japan space elevator association suggested including a second cable and using the conductivity of carbon nanotubes to provide power counterweight several solutions have been proposed to act as a counterweight a heavy captured asteroid a space dock space station or spaceport positioned past geostationary orbit a further upward extension of the cable itself so that the net upward pull would be the same as an equivalent counterweight parked spent climbers that had been used to thicken the cable during construction other junk and material lifted up the cable for the purpose of increasing the counterweight extending the cable has the advantage of some simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the earth allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space its disadvantage is the need to produce greater amounts of cable material as opposed to using just anything available that has mass launching into deep space an object attached to a space elevator at a radius of approximately 53100km would be at escape velocity when released transfer orbits to the l1 and l2 lagrangian points could be attained by release at 50630 and 51240km respectively and transfer to lunar orbit from 50960km at the end of pearsons 144000km 89000mi cable the tangential velocity is 1093 kilometers per second 679mis that is more than enough to escape earths gravitational field and send probes at least as far out as jupiter once at jupiter a gravitational assist maneuver could permit solar escape velocity to be reached extraterrestrial elevators a space elevator could also be constructed on other planets asteroids and moons a martian tether could be much shorter than one on earth mars surface gravity is 38 percent of earths while it rotates around its axis in about the same time as earth because of this martian stationary orbit is much closer to the surface and hence the elevator could be much shorter current materials are already sufficiently strong to construct such an elevator building a martian elevator would be complicated by the martian moon phobos which is in a low orbit and intersects the equator regularly twice every orbital period of 11h 6min on the near side of the moon the strength-to-density required of the tether of a lunar space elevator exists in currently available materials a lunar space elevator would be about 50000 kilometers 31000mi long since the moon does not rotate fast enough there is no effective lunar-stationary orbit but the lagrangian points could be used the near side would extend through the earth-moon l1 point from an anchor point near the center of the visible part of earths moon on the far side of the moon a lunar space elevator would need to be very longmore than twice the length of an earth elevatorbut due to the low gravity of the moon could also be made of existing engineering materials rapidly spinning asteroids or moons could use cables to eject materials to convenient points such as earth orbits or conversely to eject materials to send a portion of the mass of the asteroid or moon to earth orbit or a lagrangian point freeman dyson a physicist and mathematician has suggested using such smaller systems as power generators at points distant from the sun where solar power is uneconomical a space elevator using presently available engineering materials could be constructed between mutually tidally locked worlds such as pluto and charon or the components of binary asteroid 90 antiope with no terminus disconnect according to francis graham of kent state university however spooled variable lengths of cable must be used due to ellipticity of the orbits construction the construction of a space elevator would need reduction of some technical risk some advances in engineering manufacturing and physical technology are required once a first space elevator is built the second one and all others would have the use of the previous ones to assist in construction making their costs considerably lower such follow-on space elevators would also benefit from the great reduction in technical risk achieved by the construction of the first space elevator prior to the work of edwards in 2000 most concepts for constructing a space elevator had the cable manufactured in space that was thought to be necessary for such a large and long object and for such a large counterweight manufacturing the cable in space would be done in principle by using an asteroid or near-earth object for source material these earlier concepts for construction require a large preexisting space-faring infrastructure to maneuver an asteroid into its needed orbit around earth they also required the development of technologies for manufacture in space of large quantities of exacting materials since 2001 most work has focused on simpler methods of construction requiring much smaller space infrastructures they conceive the launch of a long cable on a large spool followed by deployment of it in space the spool would be initially parked in a geostationary orbit above the planned anchor point a long cable would be dropped downward toward earth and would be balanced by a mass being dropped upward away from earth for the whole system to remain on the geosynchronous orbit earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable with counterweight extending upward with the main spool remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is paid out a simpler process when the lower end of the cable is long enough to reach the surface of the earth at the equator it would be anchored once anchored the center of mass would be elevated more by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable this would add more tension to the whole cable which could then be used as an elevator cable one plan for construction uses conventional rockets to place a minimum size initial seed cable of only 19800kg this first very small ribbon would be adequate to support the first 619kg climber the first 207 climbers would carry up and attach more cable to the original increasing its cross section area and widening the initial ribbon to about 160mm wide at its widest point the result would be a 750-ton cable with a lift capacity of 20 tons per climber safety issues and construction challenges for early systems transit times from the surface to the level of geosynchronous orbit would be about five days on these early systems the time spent moving through the van allen radiation belts would be enough that passengers would need to be protected from radiation by shielding which would add mass to the climber and decrease payload a space elevator would present a navigational hazard both to aircraft and spacecraft aircraft could be diverted by air-traffic control restrictions all objects in stable orbits that have perigee below the maximum altitude of the cable that are not synchronous with the cable would impact the cable eventually unless avoiding action is taken one potential solution proposed by edwards is to use a movable anchor a sea anchor to allow the tether to dodge any space debris large enough to track impacts by space objects such as meteoroids micrometeorites and orbiting man-made debris pose another design constraint on the cable a cable would need to be designed to maneuver out of the way of debris or absorb impacts of small debris without breaking economics with a space elevator materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost as of 2000 conventional rocket designs cost about us25000 per kilogram us11000 per pound for transfer to geostationary orbit current space elevator proposals envision payload prices starting as low as 220 per kilogram 100 per pound similar to the 5300kg estimates of the launch loop but higher than the 310ton to 500km orbit quoted to dr jerry pournelle for an orbital airship system philip ragan co-author of the book leaving the planet by space elevator states that the first country to deploy a space elevator will have a 95 percent cost advantage and could potentially control all space activities international space elevator consortium isec the international space elevator consortium isec is a us non-profit 501c3 corporation formed to promote the development construction and operation of a space elevator as a revolutionary and efficient way to space for all humanity it was formed after the space elevator conference in redmond washington in july 2008 and became an affiliate organization with the national space society in august 2013 isec hosts an annual space elevator conference at the seattle museum of flight isec coordinates with the two other major societies focusing on space elevators the japanese space elevator association and eurospaceward isec supports symposia and presentations at the international academy of astronautics and the international astronautical federation congress each year the organization published two issues of a peer-reviewed journal on space elevators called climb and a magazine via ad astra isec also conducts one-year studies focusing on individual topics the process involves experts for one year of discussions on the topic of choice and culminates in a draft report that is presented and reviewed at the isec space elevator conference workshop to allow input from space elevator enthusiasts and other experts study reports are usually published early the following year to date these are as follows 2010 - space elevator survivability space debris mitigation 2012 - space elevator concept of operations 2013 - design consideration for space elevator tether climbers 2014 - space elevator architectures and roadmaps 2015 - design characteristics of a space elevator earth port 2016 - design considerations for the space elevator apex anchor and geo node 2017 - design considerations for a software space elevator simulator 2018 - design considerations for the multi-stage space elevator related concepts the conventional current concept of a space elevator has evolved from a static compressive structure reaching to the level of geo to the modern baseline idea of a static tensile structure anchored to the ground and extending to well above the level of geo in the current usage by practitioners and in this article a space elevator means the tsiolkovsky-artsutanov-pearson type as considered by the international space elevator consortium this conventional type is a static structure fixed to the ground and extending into space high enough that cargo can climb the structure up from the ground to a level where simple release will put the cargo into an orbit some concepts related to this modern baseline are not usually termed a space elevator but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed space elevator by their proponents for example hans moravec published an article in 1977 called a non-synchronous orbital skyhook describing a concept using a rotating cable the rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed in such a way that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be elevated it would dynamically grapple and then elevate high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit the original concept envisioned by tsiolkovsky was a compression structure a concept similar to an aerial mast while such structures might reach space 100km 62mi they are unlikely to reach geostationary orbit the concept of a tsiolkovsky tower combined with a classic space elevator cable reaching above the level of geo has been suggested other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles the vehicle is elevated up the tower which may extend as high as above the atmosphere and is launched from the top such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of 20km 12mi has been proposed by various researchers other concepts for non-rocket spacelaunch related to a space elevator or parts of a space elevator include an orbital ring a pneumatic space tower a space fountain a launch loop a skyhook a space tether and a buoyant spaceshaft spaceflight portal science portal space elevator engineering-development wiki audacious
