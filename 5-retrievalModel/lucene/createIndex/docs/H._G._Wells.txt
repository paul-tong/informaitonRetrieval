herbert george wells 21 september 1866 13 august 1946 was an english writer he was prolific in many genres writing dozens of novels short stories and works of social commentary satire biography and autobiography and even including two books on recreational war games he is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called a father of science fiction along with jules verne and hugo gernsback during his own lifetime however he was most prominent as a forward-looking even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale a futurist he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft tanks space travel nuclear weapons satellite television and something resembling the world wide web his science fiction imagined time travel alien invasion invisibility and biological engineering brian aldiss referred to wells as the shakespeare of science fiction his most notable science fiction works include the time machine 1895 the island of doctor moreau 1896 the invisible man 1897 the war of the worlds 1898 and the military science fiction the war in the air 1907 wells was nominated for the nobel prize in literature four times wellss earliest specialised training was in biology and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally darwinian context he was also from an early date an outspoken socialist often but not always as at the beginning of the first world war sympathising with pacifist views his later works became increasingly political and didactic and he wrote little science fiction while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist novels such as kipps and the history of mr polly which describe lower-middle-class life led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to charles dickens but wells described a range of social strata and even attempted in tono-bungay 1909 a diagnosis of english society as a whole a diabetic wells co-founded the charity the diabetic association known today as diabetes uk in 1934 life early life herbert george wells was born at atlas house 162 high street in bromley kent on 21 september 1866 called bertie in the family he was the fourth and last child of joseph wells a former domestic gardener and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and his wife sarah neal a former domestic servant an inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods although it failed to prosper the stock was old and worn out and the location was poor joseph wells managed to earn a meagre income but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the kent county team payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played a defining incident of young wellss life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg to pass the time he began to read books from the local library brought to him by his father he soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access they also stimulated his desire to write later that year he entered thomas morleys commercial academy a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of morleys earlier school the teaching was erratic the curriculum mostly focused wells later said on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen wells continued at morleys academy until 1880 in 1877 his father joseph wells suffered a fractured thigh the accident effectively put an end to josephs career as a cricketer and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income no longer able to support themselves financially the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations from 1880 to 1883 wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the southsea drapery emporium hydes his experiences at hydes where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices later inspired his novels the wheels of chance the history of mr polly and kipps which portray the life of a drapers apprentice as well as providing a critique of societys distribution of wealth wellss parents had a turbulent marriage owing primarily to his mothers being a protestant and his fathers being a freethinker when his mother returned to work as a ladys maid at uppark a country house in sussex one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children thereafter she and joseph lived separate lives though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other as a consequence herberts personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also later as a chemists assistant however uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself reading many classic works including platos republic thomas mores utopia and the works of daniel defoe this would be the beginning of wellss venture into literature teacher in october 1879 wellss mother arranged through a distant relative arthur williams for him to join the national school at wookey in somerset as a pupilteacher a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children in december that year however williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and wells was returned to uppark after a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at midhurst grammar school he signed his apprenticeship papers at hydes in 1883 wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship taking an opportunity offered by midhurst grammar school again to become a pupilteacher his proficiency in latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered the years he spent in southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point but his good fortune at securing a position at midhurst grammar school meant that wells could continue his self-education in earnest the following year wells won a scholarship to the normal school of science later the royal college of science in south kensington now part of imperial college london in london studying biology under thomas henry huxley as an alumnus he later helped to set up the royal college of science association of which he became the first president in 1909 wells studied in his new school until 1887 with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings a guinea thanks to his scholarship this ought to have been a comfortable sum of money at the time many working class families had round about a pound a week as their entire household income yet in his experiment in autobiography wells speaks of constantly being hungry and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished he soon entered the debating society of the school these years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society at first approaching the subject through platos republic he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed fabian society and free lectures delivered at kelmscott house the home of william morris he was also among the founders of the science school journal a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society as well as trying his hand at fiction a precursor to his novel the time machine was published in the journal under the title the chronic argonauts the school year 188687 was the last year of his studies during 1888 wells stayed in stoke-on-trent living in basford the unique environment of the potteries was certainly an inspiration he wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that the district made an immense impression on me the inspiration for some of his descriptions in the war of the worlds is thought to have come from his short time spent here seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city shooting huge red light into the skies his stay in the potteries also resulted in the macabre short story the cone 1895 contemporaneous with his famous the time machine set in the north of the city after teaching for some time he was briefly on the staff of holt academy in wales wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the college of preceptors college of teachers he later received his licentiate and fellowship fcp diplomas from the college it was not until 1890 that wells earned a bachelor of science degree in zoology from the university of london external programme in 188990 he managed to find a post as a teacher at henley house school where he taught a a milne his first published work was a text-book of biology in two volumes 1893 upon leaving the normal school of science wells was left without a source of income his aunt maryhis fathers sister-in-lawinvited him to stay with her for a while which solved his immediate problem of accommodation during his stay at his aunts residence he grew increasingly interested in her daughter isabel he would later go on to court her to earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as the pall mall gazette later collecting these in volume form as select conversations with an uncle 1895 and certain personal matters 1897 so prolific did wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified according to david c smith most of wellss occasional pieces have not been collected and many have not even been identified as his wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so as a result many of his early pieces are unknown it is obvious that many early wells items have been lost his success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work and he published his first novel the time machine in 1895 personal life in 1891 wells married his cousin isabel mary wells the couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he fell in love with one of his students amy catherine robbins later known as jane with whom he moved to woking surrey in may 1895 they lived in a rented house lynton now no141 maybury road in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at st pancras register office in october 1895 his short period in woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career for while there he planned and wrote the war of the worlds and the time machine completed the island of doctor moreau wrote and published the wonderful visit and the wheels of chance and began writing two other early books when the sleeper wakes and love and mr lewisham in late summer 1896 wells and jane moved to a larger house in worcester park near kingston upon thames for two years this lasted until his poor health took them to sandgate near folkestone where he constructed a large family home spade house in 1901 he had two sons with jane george philip known as gip 19011985 and frank richard 19031982 with his wife janes consent wells had affairs with a number of women including the american birth control activist margaret sanger adventurer and writer odette keun soviet spy moura budberg and novelist elizabeth von arnim in 1909 he had a daughter anna-jane with the writer amber reeves whose parents william and maud pember reeves he had met through the fabian society and in 1914 a son anthony west 19141987 by the novelist and feminist rebecca west 26 years his junior after beatrice webb voiced disapproval of wells sordid intrigue with the daughter of veteran fabian sydney olivier he responded by lampooning beatrice webb and her husband sidney webb in his 1911 novel the new machiavelli as altiora and oscar bailey a pair of short-sighted bourgeois manipulators in experiment in autobiography 1934 wells wrote i was never a great amorist though i have loved several people very deeply david lodges novel a man of parts 2011a narrative based on factual sources authors notegives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of wellss relations with the women mentioned above and others director simon wells born 1961 the authors great-grandson was a consultant on the future scenes in back to the future part ii 1989 artist one of the ways that wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches one common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries and they covered a wide variety of topics from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests during his marriage to amy catherine whom he nicknamed jane he drew a considerable number of pictures many of them being overt comments on their marriage during this period he called these pictures picshuas these picshuas have been the topic of study by wells scholars for many years and in 2006 a book was published on the subject writer some of his early novels called scientific romances invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as the time machine the island of doctor moreau the invisible man the war of the worlds when the sleeper wakes and the first men in the moon he also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim including kipps and a critique of english culture during the edwardian period tono-bungay wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas including the flowering of the strange orchid which helped bring the full impact of darwins revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public and was followed by many later successes such as the country of the blind 1904 according to james gunn one of wellss major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach which he referred to as his new system of ideas in his opinion the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen today referred to as the plausible impossible and suspension of disbelief while neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with he conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time the term time machine coined by wells is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle he explained that while writing the time machine he realized that the more impossible the story i had to tell the more ordinary must be the setting and the circumstances in which i now set the time traveller were all that i could imagine of solid upper-class comforts in wellss law a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society he therefore used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible wellss best-known statement of the law appears in his introduction to the scientific romances of h g wells 1933 as soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention dr griffin the invisible man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility but finds himself unable to reverse the process an enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction the island of doctor moreau sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of doctor moreau a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection the earliest depiction of uplift the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes including pain and cruelty moral responsibility human identity and human interference with nature though tono-bungay is not a science-fiction novel radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it radioactive decay plays a much larger role in the world set free 1914 this book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic hit with the first description of a nuclear weapon scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years the rate of release is too slow to have practical utility but the total amount released is huge wellss novel revolves around an unspecified invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosivesbut which continue to explode for days on end nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century he wrote than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible but they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands in 1932 the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction le szilrd read the world set free the same year sir james chadwick discovered the neutron a book which he said made a great impression on him wells also wrote non-fiction his first non-fiction bestseller was anticipations of the reaction of mechanical and scientific progress upon human life and thought 1901 when originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled an experiment in prophecy and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work it offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able rather than the traditional upper classes as leaders anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000 the book is interesting both for its hits trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom the defeat of german militarism and the existence of a european union and its misses he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950 and averred that my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea his bestselling two-volume work the outline of history 1920 began a new era of popularised world history it received a mixed critical response from professional historians however it was very popular amongst the general population and made wells a rich man many other authors followed with outlines of their own in other subjects he reprised his outline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work a short history of the world a history book praised by albert einstein and two long efforts the science of life 1930 and the work wealth and happiness of mankind 1931 the outlines became sufficiently common for james thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay an outline of scientistsindeed wellss outline of history remains in print with a new 2005 edition while a short history of the world has been re-edited 2006 from quite early in wellss career he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of utopian novels the first of these was a modern utopia 1905 which shows a worldwide utopia with no imports but meteorites and no exports at all two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history the others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe until people realise a better way of living whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a european war in the days of the comet 1906 or a world council of scientists taking over as in the shape of things to come 1933 which he later adapted for the 1936 alexander korda film things to come this depicted all too accurately the impending world war with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs he also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in the autocracy of mr parham 1930 and the holy terror 1939 men like gods 1923 is also a utopian novel wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure the critic malcolm cowley stated by the time he was forty his influence was wider than any other living english writer wells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as the island of doctor moreau not all his scientific romances ended in a utopia and wells also wrote a dystopian novel when the sleeper wakes 1899 rewritten as the sleeper awakes 1910 which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers the island of doctor moreau is even darker the narrator having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected unsuccessfully into human beings eventually returns to england like gulliver on his return from the houyhnhnms he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts slowly reverting to their animal natures wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of w n p barbellions diaries the journal of a disappointed man published in 1919 since barbellion was the real authors pen name many reviewers believed wells to have been the true author of the journal wells always denied this despite being full of praise for the diaries in 1927 a canadian teacher and writer florence deeks unsuccessfully sued wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust claiming that much of the outline of history had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript the web of the worlds romance which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of wellss canadian publisher macmillan canada however it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in toronto in the safekeeping of macmillan and that wells did not even know it existed let alone had seen it the court found no proof of copying and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources in 2000 a b mckillop a professor of history at carleton university produced a book on the case the spinster the prophet florence deeks h g wells and the mystery of the purloined past according to mckillop the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case in 2004 denis n magnusson professor emeritus of the faculty of law queens university ontario published an article on deeks v wells this re-examines the case in relation to mckillops book while having some sympathy for deeks he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers she received a fair trial adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today ie 2004 in 1933 wells predicted in the shape of things to come that the world war he feared would begin in january 1940 a prediction which ultimately came true four months early in september 1939 with the outbreak of world war ii in 1936 before the royal institution wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing world encyclopaedia to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being in 1938 he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education world brain including the essay the idea of a permanent world encyclopaedia prior to 1933 wellss books were widely read in germany and austria and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication by 1933 he had attracted the attention of german officials because of his criticism of the political situation in germany and on 10 may 1933 wellss books were burned by the nazi youth in berlins opernplatz and his works were banned from libraries and book stores wells as president of pen international poets essayists novelists angered the nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the german pen club from the international body in 1934 following the german pens refusal to admit non-aryan writers to its membership at a pen conference in ragusa wells refused to yield to nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author ernst toller be prevented from speaking near the end of the world war ii allied forces discovered that the ss had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of britain in the abandoned operation sea lion with wells included in the alphabetical list of the black book seeking a more structured way to play war games wells also wrote floor games 1911 followed by little wars 1913 which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers miniatures little wars is recognised today as the first recreational war game and wells is regarded by gamers and hobbyists as the father of miniature war gaming a pacifist prior to the first world war wells stated how much better is this amiable miniature war than the real thing according to wells the idea of the miniature war game developed from a visit by his friend jerome k jerome after dinner jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and wells joined in to compete travels to russia wells visited russia three times 1914 1920 and 1934 during his second visit he saw his old friend maxim gorky and with gorkys help met vladimir lenin in his book russia in the shadows wells portrayed russia as recovering from a total social collapse the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation on 23 july 1934 after visiting us president franklin d roosevelt wells went to the soviet union and interviewed joseph stalin for three hours for the new statesman magazine which was extremely rare at that time he told stalin how he had seen the happy faces of healthy people in contrast with his previous visit to moscow in 1920 however he also criticised the lawlessness class-based discrimination state violence and absence of free expression stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly as the chairman of the london-based pen club which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated wells hoped by his trip to ussr he could win stalin over by force of argument before he left he realized that no reform was to happen in the near future final years wellss literary reputation declined as he spent his later years promoting causes that were rejected by most of his contemporaries as well as by younger authors whom he had previously influenced in this connection george orwell described wells as too sane to understand the modern world g k chesterton quipped mr wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message wells had diabetes and was a co-founder in 1934 of the diabetic association now diabetes uk the leading charity for people with diabetes in the uk on 28 october 1940 on the radio station ktsa in san antonio texas wells took part in a radio interview with orson welles who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of the war of the worlds during the interview by charles c shaw a ktsa radio host wells admitted his surprise at the widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to welles for increasing sales of one of his more obscure titles death wells died of unspecified causes on 13 august 1946 aged 79 at his home at 13 hanover terrace overlooking regents park london some reports also say he died of a heart attack at the flat of a friend in london in his preface to the 1941 edition of the war in the air wells had stated that his epitaph should be i told you so you damned fools wells body was cremated at golders green crematorium on 16 august 1946 his ashes were subsequently scattered into the english channel at old harry rocks a commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed at his home in regents park in 1966 political views wells called his political views socialist his contemporary political impact was limited however excluding his fictions positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by physics towards world peace winston churchill was an avid reader of wells books and after they first met in 1902 they kept in touch until wells died in 1946 as a junior minister churchill borrowed lines from wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906 and as prime minister the phrase the gathering storm used by churchill to describe the rise of nazi germany had been written by wells in the war of the worlds which depicts an attack on britain by martians wellss extensive writings on equality and human rights most notably his most influential work the rights of man 1940 laid the groundwork for the 1948 universal declaration of human rights which was adopted by the united nations shortly after his death his efforts regarding the league of nations on which he collaborated on the project with leonard woolf with the booklets the idea of a league of nations prolegomena to the study of world organization and the way of the league of nations became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the second world war which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature in his last book mind at the end of its tether 1945 he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea he referred to the era between the two world wars as the age of frustration religious views wells wrote in his book god the invisible king 1917 that his idea of god did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world this book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer which is a profound belief in a personal and intimate god putting the leading idea of this book very roughly these two antagonistic typical conceptions of god may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as god-as-nature or the creator and of the other as god-as-christ or the redeemer one is the great outward god the other is the inmost god the first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the god of spinoza it is a conception of god tending to pantheism to an idea of a comprehensive god as ruling with justice rather than affection to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness the second idea which is opposed to this idea of an absolute god is the god of the human heart the writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced christianity was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of god into one focus later in the work he aligns himself with a renascent or modern religion neither atheist nor buddhist nor mohammedan nor christian that he has found growing up in himself of christianity he said it is not now true for me every believing christian is i am sure my spiritual brother but if systemically i called myself a christian i feel that to most men i should imply too much and so tell a lie of other world religions he writes all these religions are true for me as canterbury cathedral is a true thing and as a swiss chalet is a true thing there they are and they have served a purpose they have worked only they are not true for me to live in them they do not work for me in the fate of homo sapiens 1939 wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies stating there is no creed no way of living left in the world at all that really meets the needs of the time when we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately all the main religions patriotic moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast sprawling city overtaken by a landslide literary influence the science fiction historian john clute describes wells as the most important writer the genre has yet seen and notes his work has been central to both british and american science fiction science fiction author and critic algis budrys said wells remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope and the despair which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature in 1921 1932 1935 and 1946 wells so influenced real exploration of mars that an impact crater on the planet was named after him in britain wellss work was a key model for the british scientific romance and other writers in that mode such as olaf stapledon j d beresford s fowler wright and naomi mitchison all drew on wellss example wells was also an important influence on british science fiction of the period after the second world war with arthur c clarke and brian aldiss expressing strong admiration for wellss work among contemporary british science fiction writers stephen baxter christopher priest and adam roberts have all acknowledged wellss influence on their writing all three are vice-presidents of the h g wells society he also had a strong influence on british scientist j b s haldane who wrote daedalus or science and the future 1924 the last judgement and on being the right size from the essay collection possible worlds 1927 and biological possibilities for the human species in the next ten thousand years 1963 which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers in the united states hugo gernsback reprinted most of wellss work in the pulp magazine amazing stories regarding wellss work as texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre later american writers such as ray bradbury isaac asimov frank herbert and ursula k le guin all recalled being influenced by wellss work sinclair lewiss early novels were strongly influenced by wellss realistic social novels such as the history of mr polly lewis would also name his first son wells after the author in an interview with the paris review vladimir nabokov described wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and a great artist he went on to cite the passionate friends ann veronica the time machine and the country of the blind as superior to anything else written by wellss british contemporaries in an apparent allusion to wellss socialism and political themes nabokov said his sociological cogitations can be safely ignored of course but his romances and fantasies are superb jorge luis borges wrote many short pieces on wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of wellss work while borges wrote several critical reviews including a mostly negative review of wellss film things to come he regularly treated wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature late in his life borges included the invisible man and the time machine in his prologue to a personal library a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the argentine publishing house emec canadian author margaret atwood read wells books and he also inspired writers of european speculative fiction such as karel apek and yevgeny zamyatin representations literary the superhuman protagonist of j d beresfords 1911 novel the hampdenshire wonder victor stott was based on wells in m p shiels short story the primate of the rose 1928 there is an unpleasant womaniser named e p crooks who was written as a parody of wells wells had attacked shiels prince zaleski when it was published in 1895 and this was shiels response wells praised shiels the purple cloud 1901 in turn shiel expressed admiration for wells referring to him at a speech to the horsham rotary club in 1933 as my friend mr wells in c s lewiss novel that hideous strength 1945 the character jules is a caricature of wells and much of lewiss science fiction was written both under the influence of wells and as an antithesis to his work or as he put it an exorcism of the influence it had on him in brian aldisss novella the saliva tree 1966 wells has a small off screen guest role in saul bellows novel mr sammlers planet 1970 wells is one of several historical figures the protagonist met when he was a young man in the map of time 2008 by spanish author flix j palma wells is one of

1960 science fiction film the time machine based on the novel of the same name in which wells uses his time machine to try and find his utopian society malcolm mcdowell portrays wells in the 1979 science fiction film time after time in which wells uses a time machine to pursue jack the ripper to the present day in the film wells meets amy in the future who then returns to 1893 to become his second wife amy catherine robbins wells is portrayed in the 1985 story timelash from the 22nd season of the bbc science-fiction television series doctor who in this story herbert an enthusiastic temporary companion to the doctor is revealed to be a young h g wells the plot is loosely based upon the themes and characters of the time machine with references to the war of the worlds the invisible man and the island of doctor moreau the story jokingly suggests that wellss inspiration for his later novels came from his adventure with the sixth doctor in the bbc2 anthology series encounters about imagined meetings between historical figures beautiful lies by paul pender 15 august 1992 centred on an acrimonious dinner party attended by wells richard todd george orwell jon finch and william empson patrick ryecart the character of wells also appeared in several episodes of lois clark the new adventures of superman 19931997 usually pitted against the time-travelling villain
