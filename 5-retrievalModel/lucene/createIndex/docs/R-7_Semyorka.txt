the r-7 russian -7 was a soviet missile developed during the cold war and the worlds first intercontinental ballistic missile the r-7 made 28 launches between 1957 and 1961 but was never deployed operationally a derivative the r-7a was deployed from 1959 to 1968 to the west it was known by the nato reporting name ss-6 sapwood and within the soviet union by the grau index 8k71 in modified form it launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite into orbit and became the basis for the r-7 family which includes sputnik luna molniya vostok and voskhod space launchers as well as later soyuz variants the widely used nickname for the r-7 launcher semyorka means the 7 in russian description the r-7 was 34m 112ft long 302m 99ft in diameter and weighed 280 metric tons 280 long tons 310 short tons it had two stages powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen lox and kerosene and capable of delivering its payload up to 8800km 5500mi with an accuracy cep of around 5km 31mi a single thermonuclear warhead was carried with a nominal yield of 3 megatons of tnt the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage with a central sustainer motor powering through both the first and the second stage each strap-on booster included two vernier thrusters and the core stage included four the guidance system was inertial with radio control of the vernier thrusters development design work began in 1953 at okb-1 in kaliningrad in moscow oblast presently korolyov moscow oblast and other divisions with the requirement for a two-stage missile of 170 metric tons 170 long tons 190 short tons with a range of 8000km 5000mi and the maximum speed of 20 mach carrying a 3000kg 6600lb warhead following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until may 1954 and korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals in 1954 the draft project was completed for the first time the development of the project was created a separate volume 14 dedicated to the testing of missile technology this volume was developed under the leadership of arcady ilyich ostashev contrary to claims that the r-7 was based largely on experience and assistance of german scientists the missile is noteworthy for looking beyond past achievements that had used german ideas for example instead of using jet vanes for control which increased resistance generated at the engine nozzle exhaust outlet the r-7 used special control engines these same engines served as the last stages vernier thrusters because of clustered design each booster had its own propellant tanks the design team had to develop a system to regulate the propellant component consumption ratio and to synchronize the consumption between the boosters starting from the r-1 which was a copy of the german v-2 a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad it turned out that assembling a cluster of a central core and four boosters on the pad is almost impossible without it falling apart also a wind gust could knock the missile off of the pad the solution was to eliminate the pad and to suspend the entire rocket in the trusses that bear both vertical weight load as well as horizontal wind forces the launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward the new missiles grau index was 8k71 the first flight-ready vehicle was delivered to the baikonur cosmodrome on 1 may 1957 and flown on 15 may a fire broke out in the blok d strap-on almost immediately at liftoff it broke away from the booster at t88 seconds which crashed 400km 248 miles downrange the next attempt on 11 june notable the same day the united states conducted its first test launch of an icbm an electrical short caused the missile to start rolling uncontrollably and disintegrate 33 seconds after liftoff the first successful long flight of 6000km 3700mi was made on 21 august 1957 the dummy warhead impacted in the pacific ocean and five days later tass announced that the soviet union had successfully tested a multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missile a modified version of the missile 8k71ps placed sputnik 1 in orbit from baikonur on 4 october 1957 and sputnik 2 on 3 november 1957 the next icbm test took place on 30 january 1958 but the strap-ons failed to separate cleanly and damaged plumbing in the core stage which lost thrust and impacted far off target these early flights revealed assorted design flaws in the r-7 which necessitated multiple modifications to the missile testing continued through december 1959 and the last original 8k71 flew on 27 february 1961 the additional development resulted in the 8k74 also known as r-7a which was lighter had better navigation systems more powerful engines extended its range to 12000km by carrying more fuel and increased payload to 5370kg 11840lb in addition the missile was designed to be easier to take apart and service the warhead was tested on novaya zemlya in october 1957 and again in 1958 yielding an estimated 29 mt aside from the initial sputnik launches the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes however six out of nine luna probes launched on the 8k72 failed combined with the failed sputnik launch on 27 april 1958 this brought the boosters total space launch record to 6 successes in 13 attempts the improved 8k74 would then form the basis for the later vostok and molniya boosters greatly increasing reliability operational history the first strategic-missile unit became operational on 9 february 1959 at plesetsk in north-west russia on 15 december 1959 the r-7 missile was tested at plesetsk for the first time the missiles were fully deployed by 1962 total service was limited to no more than ten nuclear-armed missiles active at any time a single launch pad was operational at baikonur and from six to eight were in operation at plesetsk the costs of the system were high mostly due to the difficulty of constructing in remote areas the large launch sites required at one point each launch site was projected to cost 5 of the total soviet defense budget besides the cost the missile system faced other operational challenges with the u-2 overflights the huge r-7 launch complexes could not be hidden and therefore could be expected to be destroyed quickly in any nuclear war also the r-7 took almost twenty hours to prepare for launching and it could not be left on alert for more than a day due to its cryogenic fuel system therefore the soviet force could not be kept on permanent alert and could have been subject to an air strike before launching additionally the huge payload for which it was designed adapted to early heavy h-bombs became irrelevant with the coming of lighter bomb technology the limitations of the r-7 pushed the soviet union into rapidly developing second-generation missiles which would be more viable weapons systems the r-7 was phased out of military service by 1968 while the r-7 turned out to be impractical as a weapon it became the basis for a series of soviet expendable space launch vehicles the soyuz family of launchers as of 2018 in modified versions soyuz-u soyuz-fg and the soyuz-2 including the boosterless 21v variant the vehicle is still in service having launched over 1840 times variants note much developed variants of the r-7 are still active soyuz-u 11a511u soyuz-fg 11a511u-fg soyuz-21a 14a14a soyuz-21b 14a14b operators see also r-7 space launchers list of missiles
