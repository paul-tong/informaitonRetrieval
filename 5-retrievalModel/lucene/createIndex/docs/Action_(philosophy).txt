in philosophy an action is that which is done by an agent in common speech the term is often used interchangeably with the term behaviour however in the philosophy of action behavioural sciences and the social sciences a distinction is made behavior is automatic and reflexive activity while action is an intentional purposive conscious and subjectively meaningful activity thus things like running or throwing a ball is an instance of action it involves intention a goal and a bodily movement guided by the agent on the other hand catching a cold is not considered an action because it is something which happens to a person not something done by one perception in enactivism theory perception is understood to be sensorimotor in nature that is we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world alva no states we move our eyes head and body in taking in what is around us we crane our necks peer squint reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better lookperception is a mode of activity on the part of the whole animalit cannot be represented in terms of merely passive and internal processes movement some would prefer to define actions as requiring bodily movement see behaviorism the side effects of actions are considered by some to be part of the action in an example from anscombes manuscript intention pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants this introduces a moral dimension to the discussion see also moral agency if the poisoned water resulted in a death that death might be considered part of the action of the agent that pumped the water whether a side effect is considered part of an action is especially unclear in cases in which the agent isnt aware of the possible side effects for example an agent that accidentally cures a person by administering a poison he was intending to kill him with reasons for action a primary concern of philosophy of action is to analyze the nature of actions and distinguish them from similar phenomena other concerns include individuating actions explaining the relationship between actions and their effects explaining how an action is related to the beliefs and desires which cause andor justify it see practical reason as well as examining the nature of agency a primary concern is the nature of free will and whether actions are determined by the mental states that precede them see determinism some philosophers eg donald davidson have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes their mental properties dont seem to be doing any work if the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action however are not the cause of the action they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent see also action theory enactivism praxeology social action social relation affectional action instrumental action traditional action value-rational action communicative action dramaturgical action symbolic interactionism group action philosophy of spinoza j r finkel history of the arrow up down left right 2011 wilson george action in zalta edward n stanford encyclopedia of philosophy media related to action philosophy at wikimedia commons
