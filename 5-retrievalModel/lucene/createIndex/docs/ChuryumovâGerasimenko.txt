67pchuryumovgerasimenko abbreviated as 67p or 67pc-g is a jupiter-family comet originally from the kuiper belt with a current orbital period of 645 years a rotation period of approximately 124 hours and a maximum velocity of 135000kmh 38kms 84000mph churyumovgerasimenko is approximately 43 by 41km 27 by 25mi at its longest and widest dimensions it was first observed on photographic plates in 1969 by soviet astronomers klim ivanovych churyumov and svetlana ivanovna gerasimenko after whom it is named it came to perihelion closest approach to the sun on 13 august 2015 churyumovgerasimenko was the destination of the european space agencys rosetta mission launched on 2 march 2004 rosetta rendezvoused with churyumovgerasimenko on 6 august 2014 and entered orbit on 10 september 2014 rosettas lander philae landed on the comets surface on 12 november 2014 becoming the first spacecraft to land on a comet nucleus on 30 september 2016 the rosetta spacecraft ended its mission by landing on the comet in its maat region discovery churyumovgerasimenko was discovered in 1969 by klim ivanovich churyumov of the kiev universitys astronomical observatory who examined a photograph that had been exposed for comet comas sol by svetlana ivanovna gerasimenko on 11 september 1969 at the alma-ata astrophysical institute near alma-ata now almaty the then-capital city of kazakh soviet socialist republic soviet union churyumov found a cometary object near the edge of the plate but assumed that this was comet comas sol after returning to his home institute in kiev churyumov examined all the photographic plates more closely on 22 october about a month after the photograph was taken he discovered that the object could not be comas sol because it was about 18 degrees off the expected position further scrutiny produced a faint image of comas sol at its expected position on the plate thus proving the other object to be a different body shape the comet consists of two lobes connected by a narrower neck with the larger lobe measuring about 413318km 252111mi and the smaller one about 262318km 161411mi with each orbit the comet loses matter as gas and dust are evaporated away by the sun it is estimated that currently a layer with an average thickness of about 105m 3316ft is lost per orbit the comet has a mass of approximately 10 billion tonnes the two-lobe shape of the comet is the result of a gentle low-velocity collision of two objects the terraces layers of the interior of the comet that have been exposed by partial stripping of outer layers during its existence are oriented in different directions in the two lobes indicating that two objects fused to form churyumovgerasimenko surface there are 26 distinct regions on churyumovgerasimenko with each named after an egyptian deity regions on the large lobe are named after gods whereas those on the small lobe are named after goddesses 19 regions were defined in the northern hemisphere prior to equinox later when the southern hemisphere became illuminated seven more regions were identified using the same naming convention gates features described as gates twin prominences on the surface so named for their appearance have received names by the rosetta science working team they are named after deceased members of the rosetta team surface changes during rosettas lifetime many changes were observed on the comets surface particularly when the comet was close to perihelion these changes included evolving patterns of circular shapes in smooth terrains that at some point grew in size by a few meters per day a fracture in the neck region was also observed to grow in size boulders tens of meters wide were displaced sometimes travelling more than 100 meters and patches of the ground were removed to expose new features a number of collapsing cliffs have also been observed one notable example in december 2015 was captured by rosettas navcam as a bright patch of light shining from the comet rosetta scientists determined that a large cliff had collapsed making it the first landslide on a comet known to be associated with an outburst of activity orbit and rotation like the other comets of the jupiter family churyumovgerasimenko probably originated in the kuiper belt and was ejected towards the interior of the solar system where later encounters with jupiter successively changed its orbit up to 1840 the comets perihelion distance was 4au 600millionkm too far for the sun to vaporize the nucleus in 1840 jupiter changed the orbit to a perihelion distance of 3au 450millionkm and later encounters further decreased that distance to 277au 414millionkm in february 1959 a close encounter with jupiter moved churyumovgerasimenkos perihelion inward to about 129au 193millionkm where it remains today before churyumovgerasimenkos perihelion passage in 2009 its rotational period was 1276 hours during this perihelion passage it decreased to 124 hours which likely happened because of sublimation-induced torque 2015 perihelion as of september2014 churyumovgerasimenkos nucleus had an apparent magnitude of roughly 20 it came to perihelion on 13 august 2015 from december 2014 until september 2015 it had an elongation less than 45 degrees from the sun on 10 february 2015 it went through solar conjunction when it was 5 degrees from the sun and was 33au 490millionkm from earth it crossed the celestial equator on 5 may 2015 and became easiest to see from the northern hemisphere even right after perihelion when it was in the constellation of gemini it only brightened to about apparent magnitude 12 and required a telescope to be seen as of july2016 the comet had a total magnitude of about 20 rosetta mission churyumovgerasimenko was the destination of the rosetta mission launched in 2004 which rendezvoused with it in 2014 and was the first mission to land a space probe on a comet advance work as preparation for the rosetta mission hubble space telescope pictures taken on 12 march 2003 were closely analysed an overall 3d model was constructed and computer-generated images were created on 25 april 2012 the most detailed observations until that time were taken with the 2-metre faulkes telescope by n howes g sostero and e guido while it was at its aphelion on 6 june 2014 water vapor was detected being released at a rate of roughly 1ls 026usgals when rosetta was 360000km 220000mi from churyumovgerasimenko and 39au 580millionkm from the sun on 14 july 2014 images taken by rosetta showed that its nucleus is irregular in shape with two distinct lobes two explanations were proposed at the time that its shape may have resulted from asymmetric erosion due to ice sublimating from its surface to leave behind its lobed shape newer evidence supports the contact binary model the size of the nucleus was estimated to be 354km 2225mi rendezvous and orbit beginning in may 2014 rosettas velocity was reduced by 780ms 2800kmh 1700mph with a series of thruster firings ground controllers rendezvoused rosetta with churyumovgerasimenko on 6 august 2014 this was done by reducing rosettas relative velocity to 1ms 4kmh 2mph rosetta entered orbit on 10 september at about 30km 19mi from the nucleus landing descent of a small lander occurred on 12 november 2014 philae is a 100kg 220lb robotic probe that set down on the surface with landing gear the landing site has been christened agilkia in honour of agilkia island where the temples of philae island were relocated after the construction of the aswan dam flooded the island the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of churyumovgerasimenko has been estimated for simulation purposes at 10ms or about one ten-thousandth of that on earth because of its low relative mass landing on the comet involved certain technical considerations to keep philae anchored the probe contains an array of mechanisms designed to manage churyumovgerasimenkos low gravity including a cold gas thruster harpoons landing-leg-mounted ice screws and a flywheel to keep it oriented during its descent during the event the thruster and the harpoons failed to operate and the ice screws did not gain a grip the lander bounced twice and only came to rest when it made contact with the surface for the third time two hours after first contact contact with philae was lost on 15 november 2014 because of dropping battery power the european space operations centre briefly reestablished communications on 14 june 2015 and reported a healthy spacecraft but communications were lost again soon after on 2 september 2016 philae was located in photographs taken by the rosetta orbiter it had come to rest in a crack with only its body and two legs visible while the discovery solves the question of the landers disposition it also allows project scientists to properly contextualise the data it returned from the comets surface science the composition of water vapor from churyumovgerasimenko as determined by the rosetta spacecraft is substantially different from that found on earth the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water from the comet was determined to be three times that found for terrestrial water this makes it unlikely that water found on earth came from comets such as churyumovgerasimenko on 22 january 2015 nasa reported that between june and august 2014 the comet released increasing amounts of water vapor up to tenfold as much on 23 january 2015 the journal science published a special issue of scientific studies related to the comet measurements carried out before philaes batteries failed indicate that the dust layer could be as much as 20cm 8in thick beneath that is hard ice or a mixture of ice and dust porosity appears to increase toward the center of the comet the nucleus of churyumovgerasimenko was found to have no magnetic field of its own after measurements were taken during philaes descent and landing by its romap instrument and rosettas rpc-mag instrument this suggests that magnetism may not have played a role in the early formation of the solar system as had previously been hypothesized the alice spectrograph on rosetta determined that electrons within 1km or 06mi above the comet nucleus produced from photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation and not photons from the sun as thought earlier are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma also active pits related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts are present on the comet measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philaes lander revealed sixteen organic compounds four of which were seen for the first time on a comet including acetamide acetone methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde astrobiologists chandra wickramasinghe and max wallis stated that some of the physical features detected on the comets surface by rosetta and philae such as its organic-rich crust could be explained by the presence of extraterrestrial microorganisms rosetta program scientists dismissed the claim as pure speculation carbon-rich compounds are common in the solar system neither rosetta nor philae is equipped to search for direct evidence of organisms the only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine along with precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet the carbon in this organic material is bound in very large macromolecular compounds analogous to the insoluble organic matter in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites scientists think that the observed cometary carbonaceous solid matter could have the same origin as the meteoritic insoluble organic matter but suffered less modification before or after being incorporated into the comet one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission so far is the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen o 2 gas surrounding the comet current solar system models suggest the molecular oxygen should have disappeared by the time 67p was created about 46billion years ago in a violent and hot process that would have caused the oxygen to react with hydrogen and form water molecular oxygen has never before been detected in cometary comas in situ measurements indicate that the o 2h 2o ratio is isotropic in the coma and does not change systematically with heliocentric distance suggesting that primordial o 2 was incorporated into the nucleus during the comets formation detection of molecular nitrogen n 2 in the comet suggests that its cometary grains formed in low-temperature conditions below 30k 243c 406f on 3 july 2018 researchers reported that molecular oxygen is not made on the surface of comet 67p a finding that supports the notion that the oxygen comes from the body of the comet and may be primordial future missions caesar is a proposed sample-return mission aimed at returning to 67pchuryumovgerasimenko capturing regolith from the surface and returning it to earth this mission is competing in nasas new frontiers mission 4 selection process and as of december 2017 is one of two
