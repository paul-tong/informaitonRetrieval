remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object and thus in contrast to on-site observation especially the earth remote sensing is used in numerous fields including geography land surveying and most earth science disciplines for example hydrology ecology meteorology oceanography glaciology geology it also has military intelligence commercial economic planning and humanitarian applications in current usage the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on earth including on the surface and in the atmosphere and oceans based on propagated signals eg electromagnetic radiation it may be split into active remote sensing ie when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft and its reflection by the object is detected by the sensor and passive remote sensing ie when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor overview passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors examples of passive remote sensors include film photography infrared charge-coupled devices and radiometers active collection on the other hand emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target radar and lidar are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured establishing the location speed and direction of an object remote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the amazon basin glacial features in arctic and antarctic regions and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths military collection during the cold war made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as el nio and other natural long and short term phenomena other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation and national security and overhead ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas types of data acquisition techniques the basis for multispectral collection and analysis is that of examined areas or objects that reflect or emit radiation that stand out from surrounding areas for a summary of major remote sensing satellite systems see the overview table applications of remote sensing conventional radar is mostly associated with aerial traffic control early warning and certain large scale meteorological data doppler radar is used by local law enforcements monitoring of speed limits and in enhanced meteorological collection such as wind speed and direction within weather systems in addition to precipitation location and intensity other types of active collection includes plasmas in the ionosphere interferometric synthetic aperture radar is used to produce precise digital elevation models of large scale terrain see radarsat terrasar-x magellan laser and radar altimeters on satellites have provided a wide range of data by measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so by measuring the height and wavelength of ocean waves the altimeters measure wind speeds and direction and surface ocean currents and directions ultrasound acoustic and radar tide gauges measure sea level tides and wave direction in coastal and offshore tide gauges light detection and ranging lidar is well known in examples of weapon ranging laser illuminated homing of projectiles lidar is used to detect and measure the concentration of various chemicals in the atmosphere while airborne lidar can be used to measure heights of objects and features on the ground more accurately than with radar technology vegetation remote sensing is a principal application of lidar radiometers and photometers are the most common instrument in use collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies the most common are visible and infrared sensors followed by microwave gamma ray and rarely ultraviolet they may also be used to detect the emission spectra of various chemicals providing data on chemical concentrations in the atmosphere spectropolarimetric imaging has been reported to be useful for target tracking purposes by researchers at the us army research laboratory they determined that manmade items possess polarimetric signatures that are not found in natural objects these conclusions were drawn from the imaging of military trucks like the humvee and trailers with their acousto-optic tunable filter dual hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric vnir spectropolarimetric imager stereographic pairs of aerial photographs have often been used to make topographic maps by imagery and terrain analysts in trafficability and highway departments for potential routes in addition to modelling terrestrial habitat features simultaneous multi-spectral platforms such as landsat have been in use since the 1970s these thematic mappers take images in multiple wavelengths of electro-magnetic radiation multi-spectral and are usually found on earth observation satellites including for example the landsat program or the ikonos satellite maps of land cover and land use from thematic mapping can be used to prospect for minerals detect or monitor land usage detect invasive vegetation deforestation and examine the health of indigenous plants and crops including entire farming regions or forests prominent scientists using remote sensing for this purpose include janet franklin and ruth defries landsat images are used by regulatory agencies such as kydow to indicate water quality parameters including secchi depth chlorophyll a density and total phosphorus content weather satellites are used in meteorology and climatology hyperspectral imaging produces an image where each pixel has full spectral information with imaging narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range hyperspectral imagers are used in various applications including mineralogy biology defence and environmental measurements within the scope of the combat against desertification remote sensing allows researchers to follow up and monitor risk areas in the long term to determine desertification factors to support decision-makers in defining relevant measures of environmental management and to assess their impacts geodetic geodetic remote sensing can be gravimetric or geometric overhead gravity data collection was first used in aerial submarine detection this data revealed minute perturbations in the earths gravitational field that may be used to determine changes in the mass distribution of the earth which in turn may be used for geophysical studies as in grace geometric remote sensing includes position and deformation imaging using insar lidar etc acoustic and near-acoustic sonar passive sonar listening for the sound made by another object a vessel a whale etc active sonar emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes used for detecting ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain seismograms taken at different locations can locate and measure earthquakes after they occur by comparing the relative intensity and precise timings ultrasound ultrasound sensors that emit high frequency pulses and listening for echoes used for detecting water waves and water level as in tide gauges or for towing tanks to coordinate a series of large-scale observations most sensing systems depend on the following platform location and the orientation of the sensor high-end instruments now often use positional information from satellite navigation systems the rotation and orientation is often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses compasses can measure not just azimuth i e degrees to magnetic north but also altitude degrees above the horizon since the magnetic field curves into the earth at different angles at different latitudes more exact orientations require gyroscopic-aided orientation periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks data processing generally speaking remote sensing works on the principle of the inverse problem while the object or phenomenon of interest the state may not be directly measured there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured the observation which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation the common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints for example while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species such as carbon dioxide in that region the frequency of the emissions may then be related via thermodynamics to the temperature in that region the quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial spectral radiometric and temporal resolutions in order to create sensor-based maps most remote sensing systems expect to extrapolate sensor data in relation to a reference point including distances between known points on the ground this depends on the type of sensor used for example in conventional photographs distances are accurate in the center of the image with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center another factor is that of the platen against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances the step in which this problem is resolved is called georeferencing and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image typically 30 or more points per image which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark warping the image to produce accurate spatial data as of the early 1990s most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced in addition images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected interpretation is the critical process of making sense of the data the first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process spatial measurement through the use of a light table in both conventional single or stereographic coverage added skills such as the use of photogrammetry the use of photomosaics repeat coverage making use of objects known dimensions in order to detect modifications image analysis is the recently developed automated computer-aided application which is in increasing use object-based image analysis obia is a sub-discipline of giscience devoted to partitioning remote sensing rs imagery into meaningful image-objects and assessing their characteristics through spatial spectral and temporal scale old data from remote sensing is often valuable because it may provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography at the same time the data is often complex to interpret and bulky to store modern systems tend to store the data digitally often with lossless compression the difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile the format may be archaic and the data may be easy to falsify one of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche usually in typefonts such as ocr-b or as digitized half-tone images ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries with lifetimes of several centuries they can be created copied filed and retrieved by automated systems they are about as compact as archival magnetic media and yet can be read by human beings with minimal standardized equipment data processing levels to facilitate the discussion of data processing in practice several processing levels were first defined in 1986 by nasa as part of its earth observing system and steadily adopted since then both internally at nasa e g and elsewhere e g these definitions are a level 1 data record is the most fundamental i e highest reversible level data record that has significant scientific utility and is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced level 2 is the first level that is directly usable for most scientific applications its value is much greater than the lower levels level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally spatially or spectrally level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead these data tend to be generally more useful for many applications the regular spatial and temporal organization of level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources while these processing levels are particularly suitable for typical satellite data processing pipelines other data level vocabularies have been defined and may be appropriate for more heterogeneous workflows history the modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight the balloonist g tournachon alias nadar made photographs of paris from his balloon in 1858 messenger pigeons kites rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images with the exception of balloons these first individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes systematic aerial photography was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in world war i and reaching a climax during the cold war with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the p-51 p-38 rb-66 and the f-4c or specifically designed collection platforms such as the u2tr-1 sr-71 a-5 and the ov-1 series both in overhead and stand-off collection a more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military in both manned and unmanned platforms the advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe later imaging technologies would include infrared conventional doppler and synthetic aperture radar the development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the cold war instrumentation aboard various earth observing and weather satellites such as landsat the nimbus and more recent missions such as radarsat and uars provided global measurements of various data for civil research and military purposes space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments synthetic aperture radar aboard the magellan spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of venus while instruments aboard soho allowed studies to be performed on the sun and the solar wind just to name a few examples recent developments include beginning in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of image processing of satellite imagery several research groups in silicon valley including nasa ames research center gte and esl inc developed fourier transform techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data in 1999 the first commercial satellite ikonos collecting very high resolution imagery was launched training and education remote sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society it represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance new sensors eg terrasar-x and rapideye are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily furthermore remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters as an example 80 of the german students use the services of google earth in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times but studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with there exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject a lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity thereby the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images in fact the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images many teachers have great interest in the subject remote sensing being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching provided that the curriculum is considered in many cases this encouragement fails because of confusing information in order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the egu or digital earth encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals examples include fis remote sensing in school lessons geospektiv ychange or spatial discovery to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning software remote sensing data are processed and analyzed with computer software known as a remote sensing application a large number of proprietary and open source applications exist to process remote sensing data remote sensing software packages include erdas imagine from hexagon geospatial separated from intergraph sgi pci geomatica tntmips from microimages idrisi from clark labs ecognition from trimble and remoteview made

satellite images print-outs either use general remote sensing software eg qgis google earth storymaps or a software web-app developed specifically for education eg desktop leoworks online blif satellites first satellite uvvis observations simply showed pictures of the earths surface and atmosphere such satellite images are still used for instance as input for numerical weather forecast the first spectroscopic uvvis observations started in 1970 on board of the us research satellite nimbus 4 these measurements backscatter ultraviolet buv later also called solar buv sbuv operated in nadir geometry ie they measured the solar light reflected from the ground or scattered from the atmosphere like for the dobson instruments also the buvsbuv instruments measure the intensity in different narrow spectral intervals the intention of these buvsbuv observations was to determine information on the atmospheric o3 profile since the penetration depth into the atmosphere strongly depends on wavelength for example the light at the shortest wavelengths has only seen the highest parts of the o3 layer whereas the longest wavelengths have seen the total column while in principle the buvsbuv measurements worked well they suffered from instrumental instabilities the big breakthrough in uvvis satellite remote sensing of the atmosphere took place in 1979 with the launch the total ozone mapping spectrometer toms on nimbus 7 toms is similar to the buvsbuv instrument but measures light at longer wavelengths thus it is only sensitive to the total o3 column instead of the o3 profile however compared to the buvsbuv instruments the toms instruments were much more stable the toms instrument on board of nimbus 7 yielded the so far longest global data set on o3 1979 - 1992 this period in particular includes the discovery of the ozone hole several further toms instruments have been launched on other satellites like the dobson instruments on the ground they yield very accurate o3 total column densities using a relatively simple method besides events of very strong atmospheric so2 absorption and aerosols they are however only sensitive to o3 since april 1995 the first doas instrument is operating from space the global ozone monitoring experiment gome was launched on the european research satellite ers-2 like sbuv and toms also gome is a nadir viewing instrument unlike its predecessor instruments it covers a large spectral range 240 - 790nm at a total of 4096 wavelengths arranged in four channels with a spectral resolution between 02 and 04nm its normal ground pixel size in 320 x 40km global coverage is achieved after three days for o3 profile measurements the intensities at short wavelengths are observed buvsbuv instruments for the determination of the total atmospheric o3 column the intensities at larger wavelengths are used toms instruments in contrast to the limited spectral information of buvsbuv and toms instruments gome spectra yield a surplus of spectral information by applying the doas method to these measurements it is thus possible to retrieve a large variety of atmospheric trace gases the majority of which are very weak absorbers o3 no2 bro oclo hcho h2o o2 o4 so2 in addition also other quantities like aerosol absorptions the ground albedo or indices characterising the solar cycle can be analysed because of the high sensitivity of gome it is in particular possible to measure various tropospheric trace gases no2 bro hcho h2o so2 a further important advantage is that the gome spectra can be analysed with respect to a spectrum of direct sun light which contains no atmospheric absorptions therefore in contrast to ground based doas measurements the doas analysis of gome spectra yields total atmospheric column densities rather than the difference between two atmospheric spectra in march 2002 a second doas satellite instrument the scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography sciamachy was launched on board of the european research satellite envisat in addition to gome it measures over a wider wavelength range 240nm - 2380 including also the absorption of several greenhouse gases co2 ch4 n2o and co in the ir it also operated in additional viewing modes nadir limb occultation which allows to derive stratospheric trace gas profiles another advantage is that the ground pixel size for the nadir viewing mode was significantly reduced to 30 x 60km in a special mode even to 15 x 30km especially for the observation of tropospheric trace gases this is very important because of the strong spatial gradients occurring for such species the first tropospheric results of sciamachy showed that it was now possible to identify pollution plumes of individual cities or other big sources see also aerial
