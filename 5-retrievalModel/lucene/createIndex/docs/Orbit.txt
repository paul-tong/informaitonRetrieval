in physics an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet normally orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory to a close approximation planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse as described by keplers laws of planetary motion for most situations orbital motion is adequately approximated by newtonian mechanics which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse square law however albert einsteins general theory of relativity which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime with orbits following geodesics provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion history historically the apparent motions of the planets were described by european and arabic philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres this model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached it assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity after the planets motions were more accurately measured theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets positions in the sky more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate hence the model became increasingly unwieldy originally geocentric it was modified by copernicus to place the sun at the centre to help simplify the model the model was further challenged during the 16th century as comets were observed traversing the spheres the basis for the modern understanding of orbits was first formulated by johannes kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion first he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical not circular or epicyclic as had previously been believed and that the sun is not located at the center of the orbits but rather at one focus second he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant as had previously been thought but rather that the speed depends on the planets distance from the sun third kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the sun for the planets the cubes of their distances from the sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods jupiter and venus for example are respectively about 52 and 0723 au distant from the sun their orbital periods respectively about 1186 and 0615 years the proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for jupiter 521186 is practically equal to that for venus 07230615 in accord with the relationship idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as kepler orbits isaac newton demonstrated that keplers laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation and that in general the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously newton showed that for a pair of bodies the orbits sizes are in inverse proportion to their masses and that those bodies orbit their common center of mass where one body is much more massive than the other as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body advances in newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind kepler orbits such as the perturbations due to other bodies or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies lagrange 17361813 developed a new approach to newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force and made progress on the three body problem discovering the lagrangian points in a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics in 1846 urbain le verrier was able to predict the position of neptune based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of uranus albert einstein 1879-1955 in his 1916 paper the foundation of the general theory of relativity explained that gravity was due to curvature of space-time and removed newtons assumption that changes propagate instantaneously this led astronomers to recognize that newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits in relativity theory orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the newtonian predictions except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds but the differences are measurable essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy the original vindication of general relativity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of mercurys perihelion first noted by le verrier however newtons solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate planetary orbits within a planetary system planets dwarf planets asteroids and other minor planets comets and space debris orbit the systems barycenter in elliptical orbits a comet in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the stars planetary system bodies which are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system either natural or artificial satellites follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet owing to mutual gravitational perturbations the eccentricities of the planetary orbits vary over time mercury the smallest planet in the solar system has the most eccentric orbit at the present epoch mars has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen with venus and neptune as two objects orbit each other the periapsis is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other and the apoapsis is that point at which they are the farthest more specific terms are used for specific bodies for example perigee and apogee are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around earth while perihelion and aphelion are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the sun in the case of planets orbiting a star the mass of the star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter the paths of all the stars satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse at any point along its orbit any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit as a result as a planet approaches periapsis the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases as a planet approaches apoapsis its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases understanding orbits there are a few common ways of understanding orbits a force such as gravity pulls an object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line as the object is pulled toward the massive body it falls toward that body however if it has enough tangential velocity it will not fall into the body but will instead continue to follow the curved trajectory caused by that body indefinitely the object is then said to be orbiting the body as an illustration of an orbit around a planet the newtons cannonball model may prove useful see image below this is a thought experiment in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle speed the effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon is above the earths atmosphere which is the same thing if the cannon fires its ball with a low initial speed the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground a as the firing speed is increased the cannonball hits the ground farther b away from the cannon because while the ball is still falling towards the ground the ground is increasingly curving away from it see first point above all these motions are actually orbits in a technical sense they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity but the orbits are interrupted by striking the earth if the cannonball is fired with sufficient speed the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls so the ball never strikes the ground it is now in what could be called a non-interrupted or circumnavigating orbit for any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet there is one specific firing speed unaffected by the mass of the ball which is assumed to be very small relative to the earths mass that produces a circular orbit as shown in c as the firing speed is increased beyond this non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced one is shown in d if the initial firing is above the surface of the earth as shown there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed these will come closest to the earth at the point half an orbit beyond and directly opposite the firing point below the circular orbit at a specific horizontal firing speed called escape velocity dependent on the mass of the planet an open orbit e is achieved that has a parabolic path at even greater speeds the object will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories in a practical sense both of these trajectory types mean the object is breaking free of the planets gravity and going off into space never to return the velocity relationship of two moving objects with mass can thus be considered in four practical classes with subtypes no orbit suborbital trajectories range of interrupted elliptical paths range of interrupted elliptical paths orbital trajectories or simply orbits range of elliptical paths with closest point opposite firing point circular path range of elliptical paths with closest point at firing point range of elliptical paths with closest point opposite firing point circular path range of elliptical paths with closest point at firing point open or escape trajectories parabolic paths hyperbolic paths parabolic paths hyperbolic paths it is worth noting that orbital rockets are launched vertically at first to lift the rocket above the atmosphere which causes frictional drag and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed once in orbit their speed keeps them in orbit above the atmosphere if eg an elliptical orbit dips into dense air the object will lose speed and re-enter ie fall occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver newtons laws of motion newtons law of gravitation and laws of motion for two-body problems in most situations relativistic effects can be neglected and newtons laws give a sufficiently accurate description of motion the acceleration of a body is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it divided by its mass and the gravitational force acting on a body is proportional to the product of the masses of the two attracting bodies and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them to this newtonian approximation for a system of two point masses or spherical bodies only influenced by their mutual gravitation called a two-body problem their trajectories can be exactly calculated if the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller as in the case of a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the earth orbiting the sun it is accurate enough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body and we say that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier for the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable an exact newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system at the center of mass of the system defining gravitational potential energy energy is associated with gravitational fields a stationary body far from another can do external work if it is pulled towards it and therefore has gravitational potential energy since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated and decreases as they approach one another for point masses the gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation it is convenient and conventional to assign the potential energy as having zero value when they are an infinite distance apart and hence it has a negative value since it decreases from zero for smaller finite distances orbital energies and orbit shapes when only two gravitational bodies interact their orbits follow a conic section the orbit can be open implying the object never returns or closed returning which it is depends on the total energy kinetic potential energy of the system in the case of an open orbit the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position in the case of a closed orbit the speed is always less than the escape velocity since the kinetic energy is never negative if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation the bound orbits will have negative total energy the parabolic trajectories zero total energy and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy an open orbit will have a parabolic shape if it has velocity of exactly the escape velocity at that point in its trajectory and it will have the shape of a hyperbola when its velocity is greater than the escape velocity when bodies with escape velocity or greater approach each other they will briefly curve around each other at the time of their closest approach and then separate forever all closed orbits have the shape of an ellipse a circular orbit is a special case wherein the foci of the ellipse coincide the point where the orbiting body is closest to earth is called the perigee and is called the periapsis less properly perifocus or pericentron when the orbit is about a body other than earth the point where the satellite is farthest from earth is called the apogee apoapsis or sometimes apifocus or apocentron a line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis is the line-of-apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse the line through its longest part keplers laws bodies following closed orbits repeat their paths with a certain time called the period this motion is described by the empirical laws of kepler which can be mathematically derived from newtons laws these can be formulated as follows the orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun in one of the focal points of that ellipse this focal point is actually the barycenter of the sun-planet system for simplicity this explanation assumes the suns mass is infinitely larger than that planets the planets orbit lies in a plane called the orbital plane the point on the orbit closest to the attracting body is the periapsis the point farthest from the attracting body is called the apoapsis there are also specific terms for orbits about particular bodies things orbiting the sun have a perihelion and aphelion things orbiting the earth have a perigee and apogee and things orbiting the moon have a perilune and apolune or periselene and aposelene respectively an orbit around any star not just the sun has a periastron and an apastron as the planet moves in its orbit the line from the sun to planet sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane for a given period of time regardless of which part of its orbit the planet traces during that period of time this means that the planet moves faster near its perihelion than near its aphelion because at the smaller distance it needs to trace a greater arc to cover the same area this law is usually stated as equal areas in equal time for a given orbit the ratio of the cube of its semi-major axis to the square of its period is constant limitations of newtons law of gravitation note that while bound orbits of a point mass or a spherical body with a newtonian gravitational field are closed ellipses which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely any non-spherical or non-newtonian effects such as caused by the slight oblateness of the earth or by relativistic effects thereby changing the gravitational fields behavior with distance will cause the orbits shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of newtonian two-body motion the two-body solutions were published by newton in principia in 1687 in 1912 karl fritiof sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem however it converges too slowly to be of much use except for special cases like the lagrangian points no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies approaches to many-body problems rather than an exact closed form solution orbits with many bodies can be approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy these approximations take two forms differential simulations with large numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashion between centers of mass using this scheme galaxies star clusters and other large assemblages of objects have been simulated newtonian analysis of orbital motion the earth follows an ellipse round the sun but unlike the ellipse followed by a pendulum or an object attached to a spring the sun is at a focal point of the ellipse and not at its centre the following derivation applies to such an elliptical orbit we start only with the newtonian law of gravitation stating that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them namely where f2 is the force acting on the mass m2 caused by the gravitational attraction mass m1 has for m2 g is the universal gravitational constant and r is the distance between the two masses centers from newtons second law the summation of the forces acting on m2 related to that bodies acceleration where a2 is the acceleration of m2 caused by the force of gravitational attraction f2 of m1 acting on m2 combining eq 1 and 2 solving for the acceleration a2 where displaystyle mu is the standard gravitational parameter in this case g m 1 displaystyle gm1 it is understood that the system being described is m2 hence the subscripts can be dropped we assume that the central body is massive enough that it can be considered to be stationary and we ignore the more subtle effects of general relativity when a pendulum or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse the inward accelerationforce is proportional to the distance a f m k r displaystyle afm-kr due to the way vectors add the component of the force in the x displaystyle hat mathbf x or in the y displaystyle hat mathbf y directions are also proportionate to the respective components of the distances r x a x k r x displaystyle rxax-krx hence the entire analysis can be done separately in these dimensions this results in the harmonic parabolic equations x a cos t displaystyle xacost and y b sin t displaystyle ybsint of the ellipse in contrast with the decreasing relationship a r 2 displaystyle amu r2 the dimensions cannot be separated the location of the orbiting object at the current time t displaystyle t is located in the plane using vector calculus in polar coordinates both with the standard euclidean basis and with the polar basis with the origin coinciding with the center of force let r displaystyle r be the distance between the object and the center and displaystyle theta be the angle it has rotated let x displaystyle hat mathbf x and y displaystyle hat mathbf y be the standard euclidean bases and let r cos x sin y displaystyle hat mathbf r costheta hat mathbf x sintheta hat mathbf y and sin x cos y displaystyle hat boldsymbol theta -sintheta hat mathbf x costheta hat mathbf y be the radial and transverse polar basis with the first being the unit vector pointing from the central body to the current location of the orbiting object and the second being the orthogonal unit vector pointing in the direction that the orbiting object would travel if orbiting in a counter clockwise circle then the vector to the orbiting object is we use r displaystyle dot r and displaystyle dot theta to denote the standard derivatives of how this distance and angle change over time we take the derivative of a vector to see how it changes over time by subtracting its location at time t displaystyle t from that at time t t displaystyle tdelta t and dividing by t displaystyle delta t the result is also a vector because our basis vector r displaystyle hat mathbf r moves as the object orbits we start by differentiating it from time t displaystyle t to t t displaystyle tdelta t the vector r displaystyle hat mathbf r keeps its beginning at the origin and rotates from angle displaystyle theta to t displaystyle theta dot theta delta t which moves its head a distance t displaystyle dot theta delta t in the perpendicular direction displaystyle hat boldsymbol theta giving a derivative of displaystyle dot theta hat boldsymbol theta we can now find the velocity and acceleration of our orbiting object the coefficients of r displaystyle hat mathbf r and displaystyle hat boldsymbol theta give the accelerations in the radial and transverse directions as said newton gives this first due to gravity is r 2 displaystyle -mu r2 and the second is zero equation 2 can be rearranged using integration by parts we can multiply through by r displaystyle r because it is not zero unless the orbiting object crashes then having the derivative be zero gives that the function is a constant which is actually the theoretical proof of keplers second law a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time the constant of integration h is the angular momentum per unit mass in order to get an equation for the orbit from equation 1 we need to eliminate time see also binet equation in polar coordinates this would express the distance r displaystyle r of the orbiting object from the center as a function of its angle displaystyle theta however it is easier to introduce the auxiliary variable u 1 r displaystyle u1r and to express u displaystyle u as a function of displaystyle theta derivatives of r displaystyle r with respect to time may be rewritten as derivatives of u displaystyle u with respect to angle plugging these into 1 gives so for the gravitational force or more generally for any inverse square force law the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen to be the harmonic equation up to a shift of origin of the dependent variable the solution is where a and 0 are arbitrary constants this resulting equation of the orbit of the object is that of an ellipse in polar form relative to one of the focal points this is put into a more standard form by letting e h 2 a displaystyle eequiv h2amu be the eccentricity letting a h 2 1 e 2 displaystyle aequiv h2mu 1-e2 be the semi-major axis finally letting 0 0 displaystyle theta 0equiv 0 so the long axis of the ellipse is along the positive x coordinate relativistic orbital motion the above classical newtonian analysis of orbital mechanics assumes that the more subtle effects of general relativity such as frame dragging and gravitational time dilation are negligible relativistic effects cease to be negligible when near very massive bodies as with the precession of mercurys orbit about the sun or when extreme precision is needed as with calculations of the orbital elements and time signal references for gps satellites orbital planes the analysis so far has been two dimensional it turns out that an unperturbed orbit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space and thus the extension to three dimensions requires simply rotating the two-dimensional plane into the required angle relative to the poles of the planetary body involved the rotation to do this in three dimensions requires three numbers to uniquely determine traditionally these are expressed as three angles orbital period the orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit specifying orbits six parameters are required to specify a keplerian orbit about a body for example the three numbers that specify the bodys initial position and the three values that specify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can be calculated forwards or backwards in time however traditionally the parameters used are slightly different the traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set of keplerian elements after johannes kepler and his laws the keplerian elements are six inclination i longitude of the ascending node argument of periapsis eccentricity e semimajor axis a mean anomaly at epoch m0 in principle once the orbital elements are known for a body its position can be calculated forward and backwards indefinitely in time however in practice orbits are affected or perturbed by other forces than simple gravity from an assumed point source see the next section and thus the orbital elements change over time orbital perturbations an orbital perturbation is when a force or impulse which is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse of the main gravitating body and which is external to the two orbiting bodies causes an acceleration which changes the parameters of the orbit over time radial prograde and transverse perturbations a small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity but not the orbital period to first order a prograde or retrograde impulse ie an impulse applied along the orbital motion changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period notably a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at apoapsis and vice versa and a retrograde impulse does the opposite a transverse impulse out of the orbital plane causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity in all instances a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point orbital decay if an orbit is about a planetary body with significant atmosphere its orbit can decay because of drag particularly at each periapsis the object experiences atmospheric drag losing energy each time the orbit grows less eccentric more circular because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum this is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point the highest point of the pendulums swing becomes lower with each successive slowing more of the orbits path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced eventually the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect when this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body the bounds of an atmosphere vary wildly during a solar maximum the earths atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum some satellites with long conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the earths magnetic field as the wire cuts the magnetic field it acts as a generator moving electrons from one end to the other the orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire orbits can be artificially influenced through the use of rocket engines which change the kinetic energy of the body at some point in its path this is the conversion of chemical or electrical energy to kinetic energy in this way changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated another method of artificially influencing an orbit is through the use of solar sails or magnetic sails these forms of propulsion require no propellant or energy input other than that of the sun and so can be used indefinitely see statite for one such proposed use orbital decay can occur due to tidal forces for objects below the synchronous orbit for the body theyre orbiting the gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the bodys surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it the gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellites motion the near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up and as a result the orbit decays conversely the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism mars innermost moon phobos is a prime example and is expected to either impact mars surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years orbits can decay via the emission of gravitational waves this mechanism is extremely weak for most stellar objects only becoming significant in cases where there is a combination of extreme mass and extreme acceleration such as with black holes or neutron stars that are orbiting each other closely oblateness the standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all bodies consist of uniform spheres or more generally concentric shells each of uniform density it can be shown that such bodies are gravitationally equivalent to point sources however in the real world many bodies rotate and this introduces oblateness and distorts the gravity field and gives a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body in the general case the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as eg a planet is usually expanded in multipoles accounting for the departures of it from spherical symmetry from the point of view of satellite dynamics of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal harmonic coefficients or even zonals since they induce secular orbital perturbations which are cumulative over time spans longer than the orbital period they do depend on the orientation of the bodys symmetry axis in the space affecting in general the whole orbit with the exception of the semimajor axis multiple gravitating bodies the effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant for example the orbit of the moon cannot be accurately described without allowing for the action of the suns gravity as well as the earths one approximate result is that bodies will usually have reasonably stable orbits around a heavier planet or moon in spite of these perturbations provided they are orbiting well within the heavier bodys hill sphere when there are more than two gravitating bodies it is referred to as an n-body problem most n-body problems have no closed form solution although some special cases have been formulated light radiation and stellar wind for smaller bodies particularly light and stellar wind can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body and over time can be significant of the planetary bodies the motion of asteroids is particularly affected over large periods when the asteroids are rotating relative to the sun strange orbits mathematicians have discovered that it is possible in principle to have multiple bodies in non-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass position or velocity however some special stable cases have been identified including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies further studies have discovered that nonplanar orbits are also possible including one involving 12 masses moving in 4 roughly circular interlocking orbits topologically equivalent to the edges of a cuboctahedron finding such orbits naturally occurring in the universe is thought to be extremely unlikely because of the improbability of the required conditions occurring by chance astrodynamics orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newtons laws of motion and newtons law of universal gravitation it is a core discipline within space mission design and control celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets moons and comets orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories including orbital maneuvers orbit plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers general relativity is a more exact theory than newtons laws for calculating orbits and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations such as orbits close to the sun earth orbits low earth orbit leo geocentric orbits with altitudes up to 2000 km 01240 miles medium earth orbit meo geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2000 km 1240 miles to just below geosynchronous orbit at 35786 kilometers 22236mi also known as an intermediate circular orbit these are most commonly at 20200

geostationary orbit stays exactly above the equator whereas a geosynchronous orbit may swing north and south to cover more of the earths surface both complete one full orbit of earth per sidereal day

as 66742 0001 10 kgms thus the constant has dimension density time this corresponds to the following properties scaling of distances including sizes of bodies while keeping the densities the same gives similar orbits without scaling the time if for example distances are halved masses are divided by 8 gravitational forces by 16 and gravitational accelerations by 2 hence velocities are halved and orbital periods remain the same similarly when an object is dropped from a tower the time it takes to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the earth scaling of distances while keeping the masses the same in the case of point masses or by reducing the densities gives similar orbits if distances are multiplied by 4 gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by 16 velocities are halved and orbital periods are multiplied by 8 when all densities are multiplied by 4 orbits are the same gravitational forces are multiplied by 16 and accelerations by 4 velocities are doubled and orbital periods are halved when all densities are multiplied by 4 and all sizes are halved orbits are similar masses are divided by 2 gravitational forces are the same gravitational accelerations are doubled hence velocities are the same and orbital periods are halved in all these cases of scaling if densities are multiplied by 4 times are halved if velocities are doubled forces are multiplied by 16 these properties are illustrated in the formula derived from the formula for the orbital period for an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis a of a small body around a spherical body with radius r and average density where t is the orbital period see also keplers third law patents the application of certain orbits or orbital maneuvers to specific useful purposes have been the subject of patents tidal locking some bodies are tidally locked with other bodies meaning that one side of the celestial body is permanently facing its host object this
