the andromeda galaxy ndrmd also known as messier 31 m31 or ngc 224 is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs 25 million light-years from earth and the nearest major galaxy to the milky way its name stems from the area of the earths sky in which it appears the constellation of andromeda the 2006 observations by the spitzer space telescope revealed that the andromeda galaxy contains approximately one trillion stars more than twice the number of the milky ways estimated 200 to 400 billion stars the andromeda galaxys mass is estimated to be around 176 times that of the milky way galaxy 08-1510 solar masses vs the milky ways 8510 solar masses though a 2018 study found that the andromeda galaxys mass is roughly the same as the milky ways the andromeda galaxy spanning approximately 220000 light-years is the largest galaxy in the local group which is also home to the triangulum galaxy and other minor galaxies the milky way and andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in 45 billion years merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large disc galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 34 the andromeda galaxy is among the brightest of the messier objects making it visible to the naked eye from earth on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution observation history around the year 964 the persian astronomer abd al-rahman al-sufi described the andromeda galaxy in his book of fixed stars as a nebulous smear star charts of that period labeled it as the little cloud in 1612 the german astronomer simon marius gave an early description of the andromeda galaxy based on telescopic observations the german philosopher immanuel kant in 1755 in his work universal natural history and theory of the heavens conjectured that the blurry spot was an island universe in 1764 charles messier cataloged andromeda as object m31 and incorrectly credited marius as the discoverer despite it being visible to the naked eye in 1785 the astronomer william herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of andromeda he believed andromeda to be the nearest of all the great nebulae and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula he incorrectly guessed that it is no more than 2000 times the distance of sirius in 1850 william parsons 3rd earl of rosse saw and made the first drawing of andromedas spiral structure in 1864 william huggins noted that the spectrum of andromeda differs from a gaseous nebula the spectra of andromeda displays a continuum of frequencies superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object andromedas spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars and from this it was deduced that andromeda has a stellar nature in 1885 a supernova known as s andromedae was seen in andromeda the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy at the time andromeda was considered to be a nearby object so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova and was named accordingly nova 1885 in 1887 isaac roberts took the first photographs of andromeda which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy roberts mistook andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed in 1912 vesto slipher used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of andromeda with respect to our solar systemthe largest velocity yet measured at 300 kilometres per second 190 miles per second island universe in 1917 heber curtis observed a nova within andromeda searching the photographic record 11 more novae were discovered curtis noticed that these novae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky as a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 500000 light-years 3210au he became a proponent of the so-called island universes hypothesis which held that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies in 1920 the great debate between harlow shapley and curtis took place concerning the nature of the milky way spiral nebulae and the dimensions of the universe to support his claim of the great andromeda nebula being in fact an external galaxy curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy as well as historical observations of andromeda galaxys significant doppler shift in 1922 ernst pik presented a method to estimate the distance of andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars his result placed the andromeda nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about 450000 parsecs 1500000 light-years edwin hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of andromeda these were made using the 25-metre 8ft 2in hooker telescope and they enabled the distance of great andromeda nebula to be determined his measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the milky way in 1943 walter baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the andromeda galaxy baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity naming the young high-velocity stars in the disk type i and the older red stars in the bulge type ii this nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the milky way and elsewhere the existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by jan oort baade also discovered that there were two types of cepheid variables which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to andromeda as well as the remainder of the universe in 1950 radio emission from the andromeda galaxy was detected by hanbury brown and cyril hazard at jodrell bank observatory the first radio maps of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by john baldwin and collaborators at the cambridge radio astronomy group the core of the andromeda galaxy is called 2c 56 in the 2c radio astronomy catalog in 2009 the first planet may have been discovered in the andromeda galaxy this was detected using a technique called microlensing which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object general the estimated distance of the andromeda galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another dimmer type of cepheid in the 1990s measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the cepheid distances formation and history the andromeda galaxy was formed roughly 10 billion years ago from the collision and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies this violent collision formed most of the galaxys metal-rich galactic halo and extended disk during this epoch its rate of star formation would have been very high to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years andromeda and the triangulum galaxy had a very close passage 24 billion years ago this event produced high rates of star formation across the andromeda galaxys diskeven some globular clustersand disturbed m33s outer disk over the past 2 billion years star formation throughout andromedas disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity there have been interactions with satellite galaxies like m32 m110 or others that have already been absorbed by andromeda galaxy these interactions have formed structures like andromedas giant stellar stream a galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young 100 million years old stellar population distance estimate at least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from earth to the andromeda galaxy in 2003 using the infrared surface brightness fluctuations i-sbf and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of 02 mag dex in oh an estimate of 257006million light-years 1625103810 astronomical units was derived a 2004 cepheid variable method estimated the distance to be 251 013 million light-years 770 40 kpc in 2005 an eclipsing binary star was discovered in the andromeda galaxy the binary is two hot blue stars of types o and b by studying the eclipses of the stars astronomers were able to measure their sizes knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars they were able to measure their absolute magnitude when the visual and absolute magnitudes are known the distance to the star can be measured the stars lie at a distance of 25210 01410 ly 1594108910au and the whole andromeda galaxy at about 2510 ly 1610au this new value is in excellent agreement with the previous independent cepheid-based distance value the trgb method was also used in 2005 giving a distance of 25610 00810 ly 1619105110au averaged together these distance estimates give a value of 25410 01110 ly 1606107010au and from this the diameter of andromeda at the widest point is estimated to be 2203kly 67450920pc applying trigonometry angular diameter this is equivalent to an apparent 496 angle in the sky mass and luminosity estimates mass until 2018 mass estimates for the andromeda galaxys halo including dark matter gave a value of approximately 1510m or 15 trillion solar masses compared to 810m for the milky way this contradicted earlier measurements that seemed to indicate that andromeda galaxy and the milky way are almost equal in mass in 2018 the equality of mass was re-established by radio results as approximately 810m in 2006 andromeda galaxys spheroid was determined to have a higher stellar density than that of the milky way and its galactic stellar disk was estimated at about twice the diameter of that of the milky way the total stellar mass of andromeda galaxy is estimated to be between 810m and 1110m ie around twice as massive as that of the milky way and 1510m with around 30 of that mass in the central bulge 56 in the disk and the remaining 14 in the halo the radio results similar mass to milky way galaxy should be taken as likeliest as of 2018 although clearly this matter is still under active investigation by a number of research groups worldwide in addition to stars andromeda galaxys interstellar medium contains at least around 7210m in the form of neutral hydrogen at least 3410m as molecular hydrogen within its innermost 10 kiloparsecs and 5410m of dust andromeda galaxy is surrounded by a massive halo of hot gas that is estimated to contain half the mass of the stars in the galaxy the nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy halfway to our milky way galaxy simulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the andromeda galaxy the halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium formed from supernovae and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the green valley of the galaxy colormagnitude diagram see below supernovae erupt in andromeda galaxys star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space over andromeda galaxys lifetime nearly half of the heavy elements made by its stars have been ejected far beyond the galaxys 200000-light-year-diameter stellar disk luminosity compared to the milky way the andromeda galaxy appears to have predominantly older stars with ages 710 years the estimated luminosity of andromeda galaxy 2610l is about 25 higher than that of our own galaxy however the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the andromeda galaxy some authors even propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the milky way after the sombrero galaxy with an absolute magnitude of around -2221 or close an estimation done with the help of spitzer space telescope published in 2010 suggests an absolute magnitude in the blue of 2089 that with a color index of 063 translates to an absolute visual magnitude of 2152 compared to 209 for the milky way and a total luminosity in that wavelength of 36410l the rate of star formation in the milky way is much higher with andromeda galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 35 solar masses for the milky way the rate of novae in the milky way is also double that of andromeda galaxy this suggests that the latter once experienced a great star formation phase but is now in a relative state of quiescence whereas the milky way is experiencing more active star formation should this continue the luminosity of the milky way may eventually overtake that of andromeda galaxy according to recent studies the andromeda galaxy lies in what in the galaxy colormagnitude diagram is known as the green valley a region populated by galaxies like the milky way in transition from the blue cloud galaxies actively forming new stars to the red sequence galaxies that lack star formation star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium in simulated galaxies with similar properties to andromeda galaxy star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years from the now even accounting for the expected short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between andromeda galaxy and the milky way structure based on its appearance in visible light the andromeda galaxy is classified as an sasb galaxy in the de vaucouleurssandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies however data from the 2mass survey showed that andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy like the milky way with andromedas bar oriented along its long axis in 2005 astronomers used the keck telescopes to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself this means that the spiral disk of stars in the andromeda galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated this constitutes evidence that there is a vast extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than 220000 light-years 67000 parsecs in diameter previously estimates of the andromeda galaxys size ranged from 70000 to 120000 light-years 21000 to 37000pc across the galaxy is inclined an estimated 77 relative to earth where an angle of 90 would be viewed directly from the side analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced s-shaped warp rather than just a flat disk a possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the andromeda galaxy the galaxy m33 could be responsible for some warp in andromedas arms though more precise distances and radial velocities are required spectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of the andromeda galaxy as a function of radial distance from the core the rotational velocity has a maximum value of 225 kilometres per second 140mis at 1300 light-years 82000000 astronomical units from the core and it has its minimum possibly as low as 50 kilometres per second 31mis at 7000 light-years 440000000au from the core further out rotational velocity rises out to a radius of 33000 light-years 2110au where it reaches a peak of 250 kilometres per second 160mis the velocities slowly decline beyond that distance dropping to around 200 kilometres per second 120mis at 80000 light-years 5110au these velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 610m in the nucleus the total mass of the galaxy increases linearly out to 45000 light-years 2810au then more slowly beyond that radius the spiral arms of the andromeda galaxy are outlined by a series of hii regions first studied in great detail by walter baade and described by him as resembling beads on a string his studies show two spiral arms that appear to be tightly wound although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy his descriptions of the spiral structure as each arm crosses the major axis of the andromeda galaxy are as follows since the andromeda galaxy is seen close to edge-on it is difficult to study its spiral structure rectified images of the galaxy seem to show a fairly normal spiral galaxy exhibiting two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about 13000 light-years 820000000 astronomical units and that can be followed outward from a distance of roughly 1600 light-years 100000000au from the core alternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm or a flocculent pattern of long filamentary and thick spiral arms the most likely cause of the distortions of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy satellites m32 and m110 this can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars in 1998 images from the european space agencys infrared space observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the andromeda galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy the gas and dust within the galaxy is generally formed into several overlapping rings with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of 32000 light-years 2010au 10 kiloparsecs from the core nicknamed by some astronomers the ring of fire this ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust and most of the star formation that is taking place in the andromeda galaxy is concentrated there later studies with the help of the spitzer space telescope showed how andromeda galaxys spiral structure in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above those arms however are not continuous and have a segmented structure close examination of the inner region of the andromeda galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with m32 more than 200 million years ago simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the andromeda galaxy along the latters polar axis this collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller m32 and created the ring structures in andromeda it is the co-existence of the long-known large ring-like feature in the gas of messier 31 together with this newly discovered inner ring-like structure offset from the barycenter that suggested a nearly head-on collision with the satellite m32 a milder version of the cartwheel encounter studies of the extended halo of the andromeda galaxy show that it is roughly comparable to that of the milky way with stars in the halo being generally metal-poor and increasingly so with greater distance this evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths they are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 100200 low-mass galaxies during the past 12 billion years the stars in the extended halos of the andromeda galaxy and the milky way may extend nearly one third the distance separating the two galaxies nucleus m31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center in a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge in 1991 the hubble space telescope was used to image andromeda galaxys inner nucleus the nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by 15 parsecs 49ly the brighter concentration designated as p1 is offset from the center of the galaxy the dimmer concentration p2 falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a black hole measured at 35 10 m in 1993 and at 1123 10 m in 2005 the velocity dispersion of material around it is measured to be 160kms it has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if p1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole the eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter creating a concentration of stars p2 also contains a compact disk of hot spectral-class a stars the a stars are not evident in redder filters but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus causing p2 to appear more prominent than p1 while at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy cannibalized by andromeda galaxy this is no longer considered a viable explanation largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole while this could be partially resolved if p1 had its own black hole to stabilize it the distribution of stars in p1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center discrete sources apparently by late 1968 no x-rays had been detected from the andromeda galaxy a balloon flight on october 20 1970 set an upper limit for detectable hard x-rays from the andromeda galaxy the swift bat all-sky survey successfully detected hard x-rays coming from a region centered 6 arcseconds away from the galaxy center the emission above 25 kev was later found to be originating from a single source named 3xmm j0042321411314 and identified as a binary system where a compact object a neutron star or a black hole accretes matter from a star multiple x-ray sources have since been detected in the andromeda galaxy using observations from the european space agencys esa xmm-newton orbiting observatory robin barnard et al hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting x-rays neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses an observation campaign of nustar space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy there are approximately 460 globular clusters associated with the andromeda galaxy the most massive of these clusters identified as mayall ii nicknamed globular one has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the local group of galaxies it contains several million stars and is about twice as luminous as omega centauri the brightest known globular cluster in the milky way globular one or g1 has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular as a result some consider g1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by andromeda in the distant past the globular with the greatest apparent brightness is g76 which is located in the south-west arms eastern half another massive globular cluster named 037-b327 and discovered in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the andromeda galaxys interstellar dust was thought to be more massive than g1 and the largest cluster of the local group however other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to g1 unlike the globular clusters of the milky way which show a relatively low age dispersion andromeda galaxys globular clusters have a much larger range of ages from systems as old as the galaxy itself to much younger systems with ages between a few hundred million years to five billion years in 2005 astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in the andromeda galaxy the new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters what distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much largerseveral hundred light-years acrossand hundreds of times less dense the distances between the stars are therefore much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters in 2012 a microquasar a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the andromeda galaxy the progenitor black hole is located near the galactic center and has about 10 m displaystyle beginsmallmatrixmodot endsmallmatrix discovered through a data collected by the european space agencys xmm-newton probe and subsequently observed by nasas swift gamma-ray burst mission and chandra x-ray observatory the very large array and the very long baseline array the microquasar was the first observed within the andromeda galaxy and the first outside of the milky way galaxy satellites like the milky way the andromeda galaxy has satellite galaxies consisting of 14 known dwarf galaxies the best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are m32 and m110 based on current evidence it appears that m32 underwent a close encounter with the andromeda galaxy in the past m32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by m31 and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region which lasted until the relatively recent past m110 also appears to be interacting with the andromeda galaxy and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies m110 does contain a dusty lane which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation m32 have young population as well in 2006 it was discovered that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the andromeda galaxy they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions this may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites collision with the milky way the andromeda galaxy is approaching the milky way at about 110 kilometres per second 68 miles per second it has been measured approaching relative to our sun at around 300kms 190mis as the sun orbits around the center of our galaxy at a speed of approximately 225kms 140mis this makes the andromeda galaxy one of about 100 observable blueshifted galaxies andromeda galaxys tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the milky way is relatively much smaller than the approaching velocity and therefore it is expected to collide directly with the milky way in about 4billion years a likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy or perhaps even a large disc galaxy such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups the fate of the earth and the solar system in the event of a collision is currently unknown before the galaxies merge there is a small chance that the solar system could be ejected from the milky way or join the andromeda galaxy amateur observing the andromeda galaxy is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye even with some light pollution andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the northern hemisphere when from mid-latitudes the galaxy reaches zenith its highest point at midnight so can be seen almost all night from the southern hemisphere it is most visible at the same months that is in spring and away from our equator does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon making it difficult to observe binoculars can reveal some larger structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies m32 and m110 an amateur telescope can reveal andromedas disk some of its brightest globular clusters dark dust lanes and the large star cloud ngc 206 see also andromeda galaxy portal galaxies in fiction andromeda nebula in
