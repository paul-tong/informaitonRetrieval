mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the solar system its orbital period around the sun of 8797 days is the shortest of all the planets in the solar system it is named after the roman deity mercury the messenger of the gods like venus mercury orbits the sun within earths orbit as an inferior planet and never exceeds 28 away from the sun when viewed from earth this proximity to the sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning at this time it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than venus the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases similar to venus and the moon as it moves in its inner orbit relative to earth which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116 days mercury is tidally locked with the sun in a 32 spin-orbit resonance and rotates in a way that is unique in the solar system as seen relative to the fixed stars it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the sun as seen from the sun in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion it appears to rotate only once every two mercurian years an observer on mercury would therefore see only one day every two mercurian years mercurys axis has the smallest tilt of any of the solar systems planets about 30 degree its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the solar system at perihelion mercurys distance from the sun is only about two-thirds or 66 of its distance at aphelion mercurys surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the moons indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years having almost no atmosphere to retain heat it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the solar system ranging from 100k 173c 280f at night to 700k 427c 800f during the day across the equatorial regions the polar regions are constantly below 180k 93c 136f the planet has no known natural satellites two spacecraft have visited mercury mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975 and messenger launched in 2004 orbited mercury over 4000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planets surface on april 30 2015 the bepicolombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at mercury in 2025 physical characteristics internal structure crust 100300km 60190mi thick mantle 600km 370mi thick core 1800km 1100mi radius mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid iron sulfide outer core layer a deeper liquid core layer and possibly a solid inner core mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the solar system and is a rocky body like earth it is the smallest planet in the solar system with an equatorial radius of 24397 kilometres 15160mi mercury is also smalleralbeit more massivethan the largest natural satellites in the solar system ganymede and titan mercury consists of approximately 70 metallic and 30 silicate material mercurys density is the second highest in the solar system at 5427gcm only slightly less than earths density of 5515gcm if the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets the materials of which mercury is made would be denser than those of earth with an uncompressed density of 53gcm versus earths 44gcm mercurys density can be used to infer details of its inner structure although earths high density results appreciably from gravitational compression particularly at the core mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed therefore for it to have such a high density its core must be large and rich in iron geologists estimate that mercurys core occupies about 55 of its volume for earth this proportion is 17 research published in 2007 suggests that mercury has a molten core surrounding the core is a 500700km 310430mi mantle consisting of silicates based on data from the mariner 10 mission and earth-based observation mercurys crust is estimated to be 35km 22mi thick one distinctive feature of mercurys surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges extending up to several hundred kilometers in length it is thought that these were formed as mercurys core and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified mercurys core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the solar system and several theories have been proposed to explain this the most widely accepted theory is that mercury originally had a metalsilicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites thought to be typical of the solar systems rocky matter and a mass approximately 225 times its current mass early in the solar systems history mercury may have been struck by a planetesimal of approximately 16 that mass and several thousand kilometers across the impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle leaving the core behind as a relatively major component a similar process known as the giant impact hypothesis has been proposed to explain the formation of the moon alternatively mercury may have formed from the solar nebula before the suns energy output had stabilized it would initially have had twice its present mass but as the protosun contracted temperatures near mercury could have been between 2500 and 3500k and possibly even as high as 10000k much of mercurys surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures forming an atmosphere of rock vapor that could have been carried away by the solar wind a third hypothesis proposes that the solar nebula caused drag on the particles from which mercury was accreting which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material and not gathered by mercury each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition and there are two space missions set to make observations messenger which ended in 2015 found higher-than-expected potassium and sulfur levels on the surface suggesting that the giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and mantle did not occur because potassium and sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these events bepicolombo which will arrive at mercury in 2025 will make observations to test these hypotheses the findings so far would seem to favor the third hypothesis however further analysis of the data is needed surface geology mercurys surface is similar in appearance to that of the moon showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years because knowledge of mercurys geology had been based only on the 1975 mariner 10 flyby and terrestrial observations it is the least understood of the terrestrial planets as data from messenger orbiter are processed this knowledge will increase for example an unusual crater with radiating troughs has been discovered that scientists called the spider it was later named apollodorus albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity as seen by telescopic observation mercury has dorsa also called wrinkle-ridges moon-like highlands montes mountains planitiae plains rupes escarpments and valles valleys names for features on mercury come from a variety of sources names coming from people are limited to the deceased craters are named for artists musicians painters and authors who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field ridges or dorsa are named for scientists who have contributed to the study of mercury depressions or fossae are named for works of architecture montes are named for the word hot in a variety of languages plains or planitiae are named for mercury in various languages escarpments or rups are named for ships of scientific expeditions valleys or valles are named for radio telescope facilities mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its formation 46 billion years ago as well as during a possibly separate subsequent episode called the late heavy bombardment that ended 38 billion years ago during this period of intense crater formation mercury received impacts over its entire surface facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down during this time mercury was volcanically active basins such as the caloris basin were filled by magma producing smooth plains similar to the maria found on the moon data from the october 2008 flyby of messenger gave researchers a greater appreciation for the jumbled nature of mercurys surface mercurys surface is more heterogeneous than either marss or the moons both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology such as maria and plateaus impact basins and craters craters on mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across they appear in all states of degradation from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller a consequence of mercurys stronger surface gravity according to iau rules each new crater must be named after an artist that was famous for more than fifty years and dead for more than three years before the date the crater is named the largest known crater is caloris basin with a diameter of 1550km the impact that created the caloris basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2km tall surrounding the impact crater at the antipode of the caloris basin is a large region of unusual hilly terrain known as the weird terrain one hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the caloris impact traveled around mercury converging at the basins antipode 180 degrees away the resulting high stresses fractured the surface alternatively it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basins antipode overall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of mercury a notable basin is the 400km wide multi-ring tolstoj basin that has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials beethoven basin has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625km diameter rim like the moon the surface of mercury has likely incurred the effects of space weathering processes including solar wind and micrometeorite impacts plains there are two geologically distinct plains regions on mercury gently rolling hilly plains in the regions between craters are mercurys oldest visible surfaces predating the heavily cratered terrain these inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30km in diameter smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria notably they fill a wide ring surrounding the caloris basin unlike lunar maria the smooth plains of mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics the localisation and rounded lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins all the smooth plains of mercury formed significantly later than the caloris basin as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the caloris ejecta blanket the floor of the caloris basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern it is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact or a large sheet of impact melt compressional features one unusual feature of mercurys surface is the numerous compression folds or rupes that crisscross the plains as mercurys interior cooled it contracted and its surface began to deform creating wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps associated with thrust faults the scarps can reach lengths of 1000km and heights of 3km these compressional features can be seen on top of other features such as craters and smooth plains indicating they are more recent mapping of the features has suggested a total shrinkage of mercurys radius in the range of 1 to 7km small-scale thrust fault scarps have been found tens of meters in height and with lengths in the range of a few km that appear to be less than 50 million years old indicating that compression of the interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to the present the lunar reconnaissance orbiter discovered that similar small thrust faults exist on the moon volcanology images obtained by messenger have revealed evidence for pyroclastic flows on mercury from low-profile shield volcanoes messenger data has helped identify 51 pyroclastic deposits on the surface where 90 of them are found within impact craters a study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on mercury over a prolonged interval a rimless depression inside the southwest rim of the caloris basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents each individually up to 8km in diameter it is thus a compound volcano the vent floors are at a least 1km below their brinks and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit the scientists could not quantify the age of the volcanic complex system but reported that it could be of the order of a billion years surface conditions and exosphere the surface temperature of mercury ranges from 100 to 700k 173 to 427c 280 to 800f at the most extreme places 0n 0w or 180w it never rises above 180k at the poles due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature gradient between the equator and the poles the subsolar point reaches about 700k during perihelion 0w or 180w but only 550k at aphelion 90 or 270w on the dark side of the planet temperatures average 110k the intensity of sunlight on mercurys surface ranges between 459 and 1061 times the solar constant 1370 wm although the daylight temperature at the surface of mercury is generally extremely high observations strongly suggest that ice frozen water exists on mercury the floors of deep craters at the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight and temperatures there remain below 102k far lower than the global average water ice strongly reflects radar and observations by the 70-meter goldstone solar system radar and the vla in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar reflection near the poles although ice was not the only possible cause of these reflective regions astronomers think it was the most likely the icy regions are estimated to contain about 1010kg of ice and may be covered by a layer of regolith that inhibits sublimation by comparison the antarctic ice sheet on earth has a mass of about 410kg and marss south polar cap contains about 10kg of water the origin of the ice on mercury is not yet known but the two most likely sources are from outgassing of water from the planets interior or deposition by impacts of comets mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time it does have a tenuous surface-bounded exosphere containing hydrogen helium oxygen sodium calcium potassium and others at a surface pressure of less than approximately 05npa 0005 picobars this exosphere is not stableatoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources hydrogen atoms and helium atoms probably come from the solar wind diffusing into mercurys magnetosphere before later escaping back into space radioactive decay of elements within mercurys crust is another source of helium as well as sodium and potassium messenger found high proportions of calcium helium hydroxide magnesium oxygen potassium silicon and sodium water vapor is present released by a combination of processes such as comets striking its surface sputtering creating water out of hydrogen from the solar wind and oxygen from rock and sublimation from reservoirs of water ice in the permanently shadowed polar craters the detection of high amounts of water-related ions like o oh and h2o was a surprise because of the quantities of these ions that were detected in mercurys space environment scientists surmise that these molecules were blasted from the surface or exosphere by the solar wind sodium potassium and calcium were discovered in the atmosphere during the 19801990s and are thought to result primarily from the vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts including presently from comet encke in 2008 magnesium was discovered by messenger studies indicate that at times sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to the planets magnetic poles this would indicate an interaction between the magnetosphere and the planets surface on november 29 2012 nasa confirmed that images from messenger had detected that craters at the north pole contained water ice messengers principal investigator sean solomon is quoted in the new york times estimating the volume of the ice to be large enough to encase washington dc in a frozen block two and a half miles deep magnetic field and magnetosphere despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation mercury has a significant and apparently global magnetic field according to measurements taken by mariner 10 it is about 11 the strength of earths the magnetic-field strength at mercurys equator is about 300 nt like that of earth mercurys magnetic field is dipolar unlike earths mercurys poles are nearly aligned with the planets spin axis measurements from both the mariner 10 and messenger space probes have indicated that the strength and shape of the magnetic field are stable it is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect in a manner similar to the magnetic field of earth this dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planets iron-rich liquid core particularly strong tidal effects caused by the planets high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep the core in the liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect mercurys magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet creating a magnetosphere the planets magnetosphere though small enough to fit within earth is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma this contributes to the space weathering of the planets surface observations taken by the mariner 10 spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planets nightside bursts of energetic particles in the planets magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to the planets magnetosphere during its second flyby of the planet on october 6 2008 messenger discovered that mercurys magnetic field can be extremely leaky the spacecraft encountered magnetic tornadoes twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space that were up to 800 km wide or a third of the radius of the planet these twisted magnetic flux tubes technically known as flux transfer events form open windows in the planets magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact mercurys surface via magnetic reconnection this also occurs in earths magnetic field the messenger observations showed the reconnection rate is ten times higher at mercury but its proximity to the sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by messenger orbit rotation and longitude mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets its eccentricity is 021 with its distance from the sun ranging from 46000000 to 70000000km 29000000 to 43000000mi it takes 87969 earth days to complete an orbit the diagram on the right illustrates the effects of the eccentricity showing mercurys orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis mercurys higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval in the diagram the varying distance of mercury to the sun is represented by the size of the planet which is inversely proportional to mercurys distance from the sun this varying distance to the sun leads to mercurys surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the sun that are about 17 times stronger than the moons on earth combined with a 32 spinorbit resonance of the planets rotation around its axis it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature the resonance makes a single solar day on mercury last exactly two mercury years or about 176 earth days mercurys orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of earths orbit the ecliptic as shown in the diagram on the right as a result transits of mercury across the face of the sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between earth and the sun this occurs about every seven years on average mercurys axial tilt is almost zero with the best measured value as low as 0027 degrees this is significantly smaller than that of jupiter which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 31 degrees this means that to an observer at mercurys poles the center of the sun never rises more than 21 arcminutes above the horizon at certain points on mercurys surface an observer would be able to see the sun peek up about halfway over the horizon then reverse and set before rising again all within the same mercurian day this is because approximately four earth days before perihelion mercurys angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity so that the suns apparent motion ceases closer to perihelion mercurys angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity thus to a hypothetical observer on mercury the sun appears to move in a retrograde direction four earth days after perihelion the suns normal apparent motion resumes a similar effect would have occurred if mercury had been in synchronous rotation the alternating gain and loss of rotation over revolution would have caused a libration of 2365 in longitude for the same reason there are two points on mercurys equator 180 degrees apart in longitude at either of which around perihelion in alternate mercurian years once a mercurian day the sun passes overhead then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again then reverses a second time and passes overhead a third time taking a total of about 16 earth-days for this entire process in the other alternate mercurian years the same thing happens at the other of these two points the amplitude of the retrograde motion is small so the overall effect is that for two or three weeks the sun is almost stationary overhead and is at its most brilliant because mercury is at perihelion its closest to the sun this prolonged exposure to the sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on mercury conversely there are two other points on the equator 90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones where the sun passes overhead only when the planet is at aphelion in alternate years when the apparent motion of the sun in mercurys sky is relatively rapid these points which are the ones on the equator where the apparent retrograde motion of the sun happens when it is crossing the horizon as described in the preceding paragraph receive much less solar heat than the first ones described above mercury attains inferior conjunction nearest approach to earth every 116 earth days on average but this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to the planets eccentric orbit mercury can come as near as 822 gigametres 0549 astronomical units 511million miles to earth and that is slowly declining the next approach to within 821gm 510million miles is in 2679 and to within 820gm 510million miles in 4487 but it will not be closer to earth than 80gm 50million miles until 28622 its period of retrograde motion as seen from earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on either side of inferior conjunction this large range arises from the planets high orbital eccentricity mercury is on average the closest planet to the earth it is closest to earth 46 of the time venus is closest 36 of the time while mars is closest just 18 of the time longitude convention the longitude convention for mercury puts the zero of longitude at one of the two hottest points on the surface as described above however when this area was first visited by mariner 10 this zero meridian was in darkness so it was impossible to select a feature on the surface to define the exact position of the meridian therefore a small crater further west was chosen called hun kal which provides the exact reference point for measuring longitude the center of hun kal defines the 20west meridian a 1970 international astronomical union resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in the westerly direction on mercury the two hottest places on the equator are therefore at longitudes 0w and 180w and the coolest points on the equator are at longitudes 90w and 270w however the messenger project uses an east-positive convention spinorbit resonance for many years it was thought that mercury was synchronously tidally locked with the sun rotating once for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the sun in the same way that the same side of the moon always faces earth radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 32 spinorbit resonance rotating three times for every two revolutions around the sun the eccentricity of mercurys orbit makes this resonance stableat perihelion when the solar tide is strongest the sun is nearly still in mercurys sky the rare 32 resonant tidal locking is stabilized by the variance of the tidal force along mercurys eccentric orbit acting on a permanent dipole component of mercurys mass distribution in a circular orbit there is no such variance so the only resonance stabilized in such an orbit is at 11 eg earthmoon when the tidal force stretching a body along the center-body line exerts a torque that aligns the bodys axis of least inertia the longest axis and the axis of the aforementioned dipole to point always at the center however with noticeable eccentricity like that of mercurys orbit the tidal force has a maximum at perihelion and therefore stabilizes resonances like 32 enforcing that the planet points its axis of least inertia roughly at the sun when passing through perihelion the original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that whenever mercury was best placed for observation it was always nearly at the same point in its 32 resonance hence showing the same face this is because coincidentally mercurys rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to earth due to mercurys 32 spinorbit resonance a solar day the length between two meridian transits of the sun lasts about 176 earth days a sidereal day the period of rotation lasts about 587 earth days simulations indicate that the orbital eccentricity of mercury varies chaotically from nearly zero circular to more than 045 over millions of years due to perturbations from the other planets this was thought to explain mercurys 32 spinorbit resonance rather than the more usual 11 because this state is more likely to arise during a period of high eccentricity however accurate modeling based on a realistic model of tidal response has demonstrated that mercury was captured into the 32 spinorbit state at a very early stage of its history within 20 more likely 10 million years after its formation numerical simulations show that a future secular orbital resonant perihelion interaction with jupiter may cause the eccentricity of mercurys orbit to increase to the point where there is a 1 chance that the planet may collide with venus within the next five billion years advance of perihelion in 1859 the french mathematician and astronomer urbain le verrier reported that the slow precession of mercurys orbit around the sun could not be completely explained by newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets he suggested among possible explanations that another planet or perhaps instead a series of smaller corpuscules might exist in an orbit even closer to the sun than that of mercury to account for this perturbation other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the sun the success of the search for neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of uranus led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation and the hypothetical planet was named vulcan but no such planet was ever found the perihelion precession of mercury is 5600 arcseconds 15556 per century relative to earth or 57410065 arcseconds per century relative to the inertial icrf newtonian mechanics taking into account all the effects from the other planets predicts a precession of 5557 arcseconds 15436 per century in the early 20th century albert einsteins general theory of relativity provided the explanation for the observed precession by formalizing gravitation as being mediated by the curvature of spacetime the effect is small just 4298 arcseconds per century for mercury it therefore requires a little over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn similar but much smaller effects exist for other solar system bodies 862 arcseconds per century for venus 384 for earth 135 for mars and 1005 for 1566 icarus albert einsteins formula for the perihelion shift per revolution is 24 3 a 2 t 2 c 2 1 e 2 displaystyle epsilon 24pi 3frac a2t2c21-e2 where e displaystyle e is the orbital eccentricity a displaystyle a the semi-major axis and t displaystyle t the orbital period filling in the values gives a result of 01035 arcseconds per revolution or 04297 arcseconds per earth year ie 4297 arcseconds per century this is in close agreement with the accepted value of mercurys perihelion advance of 4298 arcseconds per century observation mercurys apparent magnitude is calculated to vary between 248 brighter than sirius around superior conjunction and 725 below the limit of naked-eye visibility around inferior conjunction the mean apparent magnitude is 023 while the standard deviation of 178 is the largest of any planet the mean apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is 189 while that at inferior conjunction is 593 observation of mercury is complicated by its proximity to the sun as it is lost in the suns glare for much of the time mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight mercury can like several other planets and the brightest stars be seen during a total solar eclipse like the moon and venus mercury exhibits phases as seen from earth it is new at inferior conjunction and full at superior conjunction the planet is rendered invisible from earth on both of these occasions because of its being obscured by the sun except its new phase during a transit mercury is technically brightest as seen from earth when it is at a full phase although mercury is farthest from earth when it is full the greater illuminated area that is visible and the opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance the opposite is true for venus which appears brightest when it is a crescent because it is much closer to earth than when gibbous nonetheless the brightest full phase appearance of mercury is an essentially impossible time for practical observation because of the extreme proximity of the sun mercury is best observed at the first and last quarter although they are phases of lesser brightness the first and last quarter phases occur at greatest elongation east and west of the sun respectively at both of these times mercurys separation from the sun ranges anywhere from 179 at perihelion to 278 at aphelion at greatest western elongation mercury rises at its earliest before sunrise and at greatest eastern elongation it sets at its latest after sunset mercury can be easily seen from the tropics and subtropics more than from higher latitudes viewed from low latitudes and at the right times of year the ecliptic intersects the horizon at a steep angle mercury is 10 above the horizon when the planet appears directly above the sun ie its orbit appears vertical and is at maximum elongation from the sun 28 and also when the sun is 18 below the horizon so the sky is just completely dark this angle is the maximum altitude at which mercury is visible in a completely dark sky at middle latitudes mercury is more often and easily visible from the southern hemisphere than from the northern this is because mercurys maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in the southern hemisphere whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in the southern hemisphere in both of these cases the angle at which the planets orbit intersects the horizon is maximized allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter from southern mid-latitudes such as argentina and south africa an alternate method for viewing mercury involves observing the planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear ideally when it is at its greatest elongation this allows the planet to be found easily even when using telescopes with 8cm 31in apertures care must be taken to ensure the instrument isnt pointed directly towards the sun because of the risk for eye damage this method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation eg on autumn evenings ground-based telescope observations of mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail the first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was mariner 10 which mapped about 45 of its surface from 1974 to 1975 the second is the messenger spacecraft which after three mercury flybys between 2008 and 2009 attained orbit around mercury on march 17 2011 to study and map the rest of the planet the hubble space telescope cannot observe mercury at all due to safety procedures that prevent its pointing too close to the sun because the shift of 015 revolutions in a year makes up a seven-year cycle 015 7 10 in the seventh year mercury follows almost exactly earlier by 7 days the sequence of phenomena it showed seven years before observation history ancient astronomers the earliest known recorded observations of mercury are from the mulapin tablets these observations were most likely made by an assyrian astronomer around the 14th century bc the cuneiform name used to designate mercury on the mulapin tablets is transcribed as uduidimguu4ud the jumping planet babylonian records of mercury date back to the 1st millennium bc the babylonians called the planet nabu after the messenger to the gods in their mythology the ancient greeks knew the planet as stilbon meaning the gleaming hermaon and hermes a planetary name that is retained in modern greek ermis the romans named the planet after the swift-footed roman messenger god mercury latin mercurius which they equated with the greek hermes because it moves across the sky faster than any other planet the astronomical symbol for mercury is a stylized version of hermes caduceus the roman-egyptian astronomer ptolemy wrote about the possibility of planetary transits across the face of the sun in his work planetary hypotheses he suggested that no transits had been observed either because planets such as mercury were too small to see or because the transits were too infrequent in ancient china mercury was known as the hour star chen-xing it was associated with the direction north and the phase of water in the five phases system of metaphysics modern chinese korean japanese and vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the water star based on the five elements hindu mythology used the name budha for mercury and this god was thought to preside over wednesday the god odin or woden of germanic paganism was associated with the planet mercury and wednesday the maya may have represented mercury as an owl or possibly four owls two for the morning aspect and two for the evening that served as a messenger to the underworld in medieval islamic astronomy the andalusian astronomer ab ishq ibrhm al-zarql in the 11th century described the deferent of mercurys geocentric orbit as being oval like an egg or a pignon although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his astronomical calculations in the 12th century ibn bajjah observed two planets as black spots on the face of the sun which was later suggested as the transit of mercury andor venus by the maragha astronomer qotb al-din shirazi in the 13th century note that most such medieval reports of transits were later taken as observations of sunspots in india the kerala school astronomer nilakantha somayaji in the 15th century developed a partially heliocentric planetary model in which mercury orbits the sun which in turn orbits earth similar to the tychonic system later proposed by tycho brahe in the late 16th century ground-based telescopic research the first telescopic observations of mercury were made by galileo in the early 17th century although he observed phases when he looked at venus his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phases of mercury in 1631 pierre gassendi made the first telescopic observations of the transit of a planet across the sun when he saw a transit of mercury predicted by johannes kepler in 1639 giovanni zupi used a telescope to discover that the planet had orbital phases similar to venus and the moon the observation demonstrated conclusively that mercury orbited around the sun a rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another occultation as seen from earth mercury and venus occult each other every few centuries and the event of may 28 1737 is the only one historically observed having been seen by john bevis at the royal greenwich observatory the next occultation of mercury by venus will be on december 3 2133 the difficulties inherent in observing mercury mean that it has been far less studied than the other planets in 1800 johann schrter made observations of surface features claiming to have observed 20-kilometre-high 12mi mountains friedrich bessel used schrters drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70 in the 1880s giovanni schiaparelli mapped the planet more accurately and suggested that mercurys rotational period was 88 days the same as its orbital period due to tidal locking this phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation the effort to map the surface of mercury was continued by eugenios antoniadi who published a book in 1934 that included both maps and his own observations many of the planets surface features particularly the albedo features take their names from antoniadis map in june 1962 soviet scientists at the institute of radio-engineering and electronics of the ussr academy of sciences led by vladimir kotelnikov became the first to bounce a radar signal off mercury and receive it starting radar observations of the planet three years later radar observations by americans gordon pettengill and r dyce using the 300-meter arecibo observatory radio telescope in puerto rico showed conclusively that the planets rotational period was about 59 days the theory that mercurys rotation was synchronous had become widely held and it was a surprise to astronomers when these radio observations were announced if mercury were tidally locked its dark face would be extremely cold but measurements of radio emission revealed that it was much hotter than expected astronomers were reluctant to drop the synchronous rotation theory and proposed alternative mechanisms such as powerful heat-distributing winds to explain the observations italian astronomer giuseppe colombo noted that the rotation value was about two-thirds of mercurys orbital period and proposed that the planets orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 32 rather than a 11 resonance data from mariner 10 subsequently confirmed this view this means that schiaparellis and antoniadis maps were not wrong instead the astronomers saw the same features during every second orbit and recorded them but disregarded those seen in the meantime when mercurys other face was toward the sun because the orbital geometry meant that these observations were made under poor viewing conditions ground-based optical observations did not shed much further light on mercury but radio astronomers using interferometry at microwave wavelengths a technique that enables removal of the solar radiation were able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the subsurface layers to a depth of several meters not until the first space probe flew past mercury did many of its most fundamental morphological properties become known moreover recent technological advances have led to improved ground-based observations in 2000 high-resolution lucky imaging observations were conducted by the mount wilson observatory 15 meter hale telescope they provided the first views that resolved surface features on the parts of mercury that were not imaged in the mariner 10 mission most of the planet has been mapped by the arecibo radar telescope with 5km 31mi resolution including polar deposits in shadowed craters of what may be water ice research with space probes reaching mercury from earth poses significant technical challenges because it orbits so much closer to the sun than earth a mercury-bound spacecraft launched from earth must travel over 91million kilometres 57million miles into the suns gravitational potential well mercury has an orbital speed of 48kms 30mis whereas earths orbital speed is 30kms 19mis therefore the spacecraft must make a large change in velocity delta-v to enter a hohmann transfer orbit that passes near mercury as compared to the delta-v required for other planetary missions the potential energy liberated by moving down the suns potential well becomes kinetic energy requiring another large delta-v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by mercury to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft would rely entirely on rocket motors aerobraking is ruled out because mercury has a negligible atmosphere a trip to mercury requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the solar system completely as a result only two space probes have visited it so far a proposed alternative approach would use a solar sail to attain a mercury-synchronous orbit around the sun mariner 10 the first spacecraft to visit mercury was nasas mariner 10 19741975 the spacecraft used the gravity of venus to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach mercury making it both the first spacecraft to use this gravitational slingshot effect and the first nasa mission to visit multiple planets mariner 10 provided the first close-up images of mercurys surface which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature and revealed many other types of geological features such as the giant scarps that were later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools unfortunately the same face of the planet was lit at each of mariner 10s close approaches this made close observation of both sides of the planet impossible and resulted in the mapping of less than 45 of the planets surface the spacecraft made three close approaches to mercury the closest of which took it to within 327km 203mi of the surface at the first close approach instruments detected a magnetic field to the great surprise of planetary geologistsmercurys rotation was expected to be much too slow to generate a significant dynamo effect the second close approach was primarily used for imaging but at the third approach extensive magnetic data were obtained the data revealed that the planets magnetic field is much like earths which deflects the solar wind around the planet for many years after the mariner 10 encounters the origin of mercurys magnetic field remained the subject of several competing theories on march 24 1975 just eight days after its final close approach mariner 10 ran out of fuel because its orbit could no longer be accurately controlled mission controllers instructed the probe to shut down mariner 10 is thought to be still orbiting the sun passing close to mercury every few months messenger a second nasa mission to mercury named messenger mercury surface space environment geochemistry and ranging was launched on august 3 2004 it made a fly-by of earth in august 2005 and of venus in october 2006 and june 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around mercury a first fly-by of mercury occurred on january 14 2008 a second on october 6 2008 and a third on september 29 2009 most of the hemisphere not imaged by mariner 10 was mapped during these fly-bys the probe successfully entered an elliptical orbit around the planet on march 18 2011 the first orbital image of mercury was obtained on march 29 2011 the probe finished a one-year mapping mission and then entered a one-year extended mission into 2013 in addition to continued observations and mapping of mercury messenger observed the 2012 solar maximum the mission was designed to clear up six key issues mercurys high density its geological history the nature of its magnetic field the structure of its core whether it has ice at its poles and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from to this end the probe carried imaging devices that gathered much-higher-resolution images of much more of mercury than mariner 10 assorted spectrometers to determine abundances of elements in the crust and magnetometers and devices to measure velocities of charged particles measurements of changes in the probes orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of the planets interior structure messengers final maneuver was on april 24 2015 and it crashed into mercurys surface on april 30 2015 the spacecrafts impact with mercury occurred near 326 pm edt on april 30 2015 leaving a crater estimated to be 16m 52ft in diameter bepicolombo the european space agency and the japanese space agency developed and launched a joint mission called bepicolombo which will orbit mercury with two probes one to map the planet and the other to study its magnetosphere launched on october 20 2018 bepicolombo is expected to reach mercury in 2025 it will release a magnetometer probe into an elliptical orbit then chemical rockets will fire to deposit the mapper probe into a circular orbit both probes will operate for one terrestrial year the mapper probe carries an array of spectrometers similar to those on messenger and will study the planet at many different wavelengths including infrared
