astronautics or cosmonautics is the theory and practice of navigation beyond earths atmosphere the term astronautics originally astronautique in french was coined in the 1920s by j-h rosny president of the goncourt academy in analogy with aeronautics because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once in 1930 robert esnault-pelterie published the first book on the new research field as with aeronautics the restrictions of mass temperatures and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions high-grade vacuum the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the magnetic belts of low earth orbit space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces while satellites can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual payload that reaches orbit history the early history of astronautics is theoretical the fundamental mathematics of space travel was established by isaac newton in his 1687 treatise philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica other mathematicians such as swiss leonhard euler and franco-italian joseph louis lagrange also made essential contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries in spite of this astronautics did not become a practical discipline until the mid-20th century on the other hand the question of spaceflight puzzled the literary imaginations of such figures as jules verne and h g wells at the beginning of the 20th century russian cosmist konstantin tsiolkovsky derived the rocket equation the governing equation for a rocket-based propulsion enabling computation of the final velocity of a rocket from the mass of spacecraft m 1 displaystyle m1 combined mass of propellant and spacecraft m 0 displaystyle m0 and exhaust velocity of the propellant v e displaystyle ve by the early 1920s american robert goddard was developing liquid-propellant rockets which would in a few brief decades become a critical component in the designs of such famous rockets as the v-2 and saturn v the prix dastronautique astronautics prize awarded by the socit astronomique de france the french astronomical society was the first prize on this subject the international award established by aviation and astronautical pioneer robert esnault-pelterie and andr-louis hirsch was given from 1929-1939 in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics by the mid 1950s the space race between the ussr and the usa had begun subdisciplines although many regard astronautics itself as a rather specialized subject engineers and scientists working in this area must be knowledgeable in many distinct fields astrodynamics the study of orbital motion those specializing in this field examine topics such as spacecraft trajectories ballistics and celestial mechanics spacecraft propulsion how spacecraft change orbits and how they are launched most spacecraft have some variety of rocket engine and thus most research efforts focus on some variety of rocket propulsion such as chemical nuclear or electric spacecraft design a specialized form of systems engineering that centers on combining all the necessary subsystems for a particular launch vehicle or satellite controls keeping a satellite or rocket in its desired orbit as in spacecraft navigation and orientation as in attitude control space environment although more a sub-discipline of physics rather than astronautics the effects of space weather and other environmental issues constitute an increasingly important field of study for spacecraft designers related fields of study aeronautics and aerospace mechanical engineering physics see also robert esnault-pelterie aerospace atmospheric reentry konstantin tsiolkovsky sergei korolev space race robert goddard hermann oberth wernher von braun spacefaring frank malina french space program
