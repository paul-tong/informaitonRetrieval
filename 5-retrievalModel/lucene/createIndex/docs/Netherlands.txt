the netherlands dutch nederland nedrlnt listen is a country located mainly in northwestern europe the european portion of the netherlands consists of twelve separate provinces that border germany to the east belgium to the south and the north sea to the northwest with maritime borders in the north sea with belgium germany and the united kingdom including three island territories in the caribbean seabonaire sint eustatius and saba it forms a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands the official language is dutch but a secondary official language in the province of friesland is west frisian the five largest cities in the netherlands are amsterdam rotterdam the hague utrecht and eindhoven amsterdam is the countrys capital while the hague holds the seat of the states general cabinet and supreme court the port of rotterdam is the largest port in europe and the largest in any country outside asia the country is a founding member of the eu eurozone g10 nato oecd and wto as well as a part of the schengen area and the trilateral benelux union it hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts many of which are centered in the hague which is consequently dubbed the worlds legal capital netherlands literally means lower countries in reference to its low elevation and flat topography with only about 50 of its land exceeding 1 metre 3ft 3in above sea level and nearly 17 falling below sea level most of the areas below sea level known as polders are the result of land reclamation that began in the 16th century with a population of 1725 million people all living within a total area of roughly 41500 square kilometres 16000sqmiof which the land area is 33700 square kilometres 13000sqmithe netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world nevertheless it is the worlds second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products after the united states owing to its fertile soil mild climate and intensive agriculture the netherlands was historically the third country in the world to have representative government and it has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848 the country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance having legalised abortion prostitution and human euthanasia along with maintaining a progressive drug policy the netherlands abolished the death penalty in 1870 allowed womens suffrage in 1917 and became the worlds first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001 its mixed-market advanced economy had the thirteenth-highest per capita income globally the netherlands ranks among the highest in international indexes of press freedom economic freedom human development and quality of life as well as happiness its strong performance on these indexes is owed in large part to a generous welfare state that provides universal healthcare public education and infrastructure in addition to social benefits the country is also known for its polder model a leading socioeconomic model based on consensus decision-making etymology the netherlands turbulent history and shifts of power resulted in exceptionally many and widely varying names in different languages there is diversity even within languages this holds also for english where dutch is the adjective form and the misnomer holland a synonym for the country netherlands dutch comes from theodiscus and in the past centuries the hub of dutch culture is found in its most populous region holland home to the capital city of amsterdam government headquarters at the hague and europes largest port rotterdam referring to the netherlands as holland in the english language is similar to calling the united kingdom england by people outside the uk the term is so pervasive among potential investors and tourists however that the dutch governments international websites for tourism and trade are hollandcom and hollandtradeandinvestcom the region of holland consists of north and south holland two of the nations twelve provinces formerly a single province and earlier still the county of holland a remnant of the dissolved frisian kingdom following the decline of the duchy of brabant and the county of flanders holland became the most economically and politically important county in the low countries region the emphasis on holland during the formation of the dutch republic the eighty years war and the anglo-dutch wars in the 16th 17th and 18th century made holland serve as a pars pro toto for the entire country which is now considered either incorrect informal or depending on context opprobrious nonetheless holland is widely used in reference to the netherlands national football team the region called the low countries comprising belgium the netherlands and luxembourg and the country of the netherlands have the same toponymy place names with neder or lage nieder nether or low and nedre in germanic languages and bas or inferior in romance languages are in use in places all over europe they are sometimes used in a deictic relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as upper boven oben superior or haut in the case of the low countries netherlands the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea the geographical location of the upper region however changed tremendously over time depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the low countries area the romans made a distinction between the roman provinces of downstream germania inferior nowadays part of belgium and the netherlands and upstream germania superior nowadays part of germany the designation low to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century duchy of lower lorraine that covered much of the low countries but this time the corresponding upper region is upper lorraine in nowadays northern france the dukes of burgundy who ruled the low countries in the 15th century used the term les pays de par de the lands over here for the low countries as opposed to les pays de par del the lands over there for their original homeland burgundy in present-day east-central france under habsburg rule les pays de par de developed in pays dembas lands down-here a deictic expression in relation to other habsburg possessions like hungary and austria this was translated as neder-landen in contemporary dutch official documents from a regional point of view niderlant was also the area between the meuse and the lower rhine in the late middle ages the area known as oberland high country was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located cologne from the mid-sixteenth century on the low countries and the netherlands lost their original deictic meaning they were probably the most commonly used names besides flanders another pars pro toto for the low countries especially in romance language speaking europe the eighty years war 15681648 divided the low countries into an independent northern dutch republic or latinised belgica foederata federated netherlands the precursor state of the netherlands and a spanish controlled southern netherlands latinised belgica regia royal netherlands the precursor state of belgium the low countries today is a designation that includes the countries the netherlands belgium and luxembourg although in most romance languages the term low countries is used as the name for the netherlands specifically it is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term benelux history prehistory before 800 bc the prehistory of the area that is now the netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography the oldest human neanderthal traces were found in higher soils near maastricht from what is believed to be about 250000 years ago at the end of the ice age the nomadic late upper paleolithic hamburg culture c 1300010000 bc hunted reindeer in the area using spears but the later ahrensburg culture c 112009500 bc used bow and arrow from mesolithic maglemosian-like tribes c 8000 bc the oldest canoe in the world was found in drenthe indigenous late mesolithic hunter-gatherers from the swifterbant culture c 5600 bc were related to the southern scandinavian erteblle culture and were strongly linked to rivers and open water between 4800 and 4500 bc the swifterbant people started to copy from the neighbouring linear pottery culture the practise of animal husbandry and between 4300 and 4000 bc the practise of agriculture to swifterbant related funnelbeaker culture c 43002800 bc erected the dolmens large stone grave monuments found in drenthe there was a quick and smooth transition from the funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-european corded ware pastoralist culture c 2950 bc although in the southwest the seine-oise-marne culture related vlaardingen culture c 2600 bc an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the neolithic period until it was finally succeeded by the corded ware culture as well of the subsequent bell beaker culture 27002100 bc several regions of origin have been postulated notably the iberian peninsula the netherlands and central europe they introduced metalwork in copper gold and later bronze and opened international trade routes not seen before reflected in the discoveries of copper artifacts as the metal is not normally found in dutch soil the many finds in drenthe of rare bronze objects suggest that it was even a trading centre in the bronze age 2000800 bc the bell beaker culture developed locally into the barbed-wire beaker culture 21001800 bc and later the elp culture c 1800800 bc a middle bronze age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker the initial phase of the elp culture was characterised by tumuli 18001200 bc that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern germany and scandinavia and were apparently related to the tumulus culture in central europe the subsequent phase was that of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns which were then buried in fields following the customs of the urnfield culture 1200800 bc the southern region became dominated by the related hilversum culture 1800800 bc which apparently inherited cultural ties with britain of the previous barbed-wire beaker culture celts germanic tribes and romans 800 bc410 ad from 800 bc onwards the iron age celtic hallstatt culture became influential replacing the hilversum culture iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country including bog iron smiths travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron fabricating tools on demand the kings grave of oss 700 bc was found in a burial mound the largest of its kind in western europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral the deteriorating climate in scandinavia around 850 bc that further deteriorated around 650 bc might have triggered migration of germanic tribes from the north by the time this migration was complete around 250 bc a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged the north sea germanic ingvaeones inhabited the northern part of the low countries they would later develop into the frisii and the early saxons a second grouping the weser-rhine germanic or istvaeones extended along the middle rhine and weser and inhabited the low countries south of the great rivers this group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the salian franks also the celtic la tne culture c 450 bc up to the roman conquest had expanded over a wide range including the southern area of the low countries some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language neither germanic nor celtic survived in the netherlands until the roman period the iron age nordwestblock culture that eventually was being absorbed by the celts to the south and the germanic peoples from the east during the gallic wars the area south and west of the rhine was conquered by roman forces under julius caesar from 57 bc to 53 bc caesar describes two main celtic tribes living in what is now the southern netherlands the menapii and the eburones the rhine became fixed as romes northern frontier around 12 ad notable towns would arise along the limes germanicus nijmegen and voorburg at first part of gallia belgica the area south of the limes became part of the roman province of germania inferior the area to the north of the rhine inhabited by the frisii remained outside roman rule but not its presence and control while the germanic border tribes of the batavi and cananefates served in the roman cavalry the batavi rose against the romans in the batavian rebellion of 69 ad but were eventually defeated the batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the salian franks whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century salian franks appear in roman texts as both allies and enemies they were forced by the confederation of the saxons from the east to move over the rhine into roman territory in the fourth century from their new base in west flanders and the southwest netherlands they were raiding the english channel roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the franks who continued to be feared at least until the time of julian the apostate 358 when salian franks were allowed to settle as foederati in toxandria it has been postulated that after deteriorating climate conditions and the romans withdrawal the frisii disappeared as laeti in c 296 leaving the coastal lands largely unpopulated for the next two centuries however recent excavations in kennemerland show clear indication of a permanent habituation early middle ages 4111000 after roman government in the area collapsed the franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms by the 490s clovis i had conquered and united all these territories in the southern netherlands in one frankish kingdom and from there continued his conquests into gaul during this expansion franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the vulgar latin of the local population a widening cultural divide grew with the franks remaining in their original homeland in the north ie southern netherlands and flanders who kept on speaking old frankish which by the ninth century had evolved into old low franconian or old dutch a dutch-french language boundary came into existence to the north of the franks climatic conditions on the coast improved and during the migration period the abandoned land was resettled again mostly by saxons but also by the closely related angles jutes and ancient frisii many moved on to england and came to be known as anglo-saxons but those who stayed would be referred to as frisians and their language as frisian named after the land that was once inhabited by frisii frisian was spoken along the entire southern north sea coast and it is still the language most closely related to english among the living languages of continental europe by the seventh century a frisian kingdom 650734 under king aldegisel and king redbad emerged with utrecht as its centre of power while dorestad was a flourishing trading place between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the frisians and the franks in 734 at the battle of the boarn the frisians were defeated after a series of wars with the approval of the franks the anglo-saxon missionary willibrord converted the frisian people to christianity he established the archdiocese of utrecht and became bishop of the frisians however his successor boniface was murdered by the frisians in dokkum in 754 the frankish carolingian empire modeled itself after the roman empire and controlled much of western europe however as of 843 it was divided into three partseast middle and west francia most of present-day netherlands became part of middle francia which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours it comprised territories from frisia in the north to the kingdom of italy in the south around 850 lothair i of middle francia acknowledged the viking rorik of dorestad as ruler of most of frisia when the kingdom of middle francia was partitioned in 855 the lands north of the alps passed to lothair ii and consecutively were named lotharingia after he died in 869 lotharingia was partitioned into upper and lower lotharingia the latter part comprising the low countries that technically became part of east francia in 870 although it was effectively under the control of vikings who raided the largely defenceless frisian and frankish towns lying on the frisian coast and along the rivers around 879 another viking raided the frisian lands godfrid duke of frisia the viking raids made the sway of french and german lords in the area weak resistance to the vikings if any came from local nobles who gained in stature as a result and that laid the basis for the disintegration of lower lotharingia into semi-independent states one of these local nobles was gerolf of holland who assumed lordship in frisia after he helped to assassinate godfrid and viking rule came to an end high middle ages 10001384 the holy roman empire the successor state of east francia and then lotharingia ruled much of the low countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity powerful local nobles turned their cities counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor holland hainaut flanders gelre brabant and utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions the language and culture of most of the people who lived in the county of holland were originally frisian as frankish settlement progressed from flanders and brabant the area quickly became old low franconian or old dutch the rest of frisia in the north now friesland and groningen continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions collectively called the frisian freedom and resented the imposition of the feudal system around 1000 ad due to several agricultural developments the economy started to develop at a fast pace and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen towns grew around monasteries and castles and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas especially in flanders and later also brabant wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign in practice this meant that brugge and antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in europe around 1100 ad farmers from flanders and utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western netherlands and made the emergence of the county of holland as centre of power possible the title of count of holland were fought over in the hook and cod wars dutch hoekse en kabeljauwse twisten between 1350 and 1490 the cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities while the hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen these noblemen invited the duke philip the good of burgundy who was also count of flanders to conquer holland burgundian and spanish habsburg netherlands 13841581 most of the imperial and french fiefs in what is now the netherlands and belgium were united in a personal union by philip the good duke of burgundy in 1433 the house of valois-burgundy and their habsburg heirs would rule the low countries in the period from 1384 to 1581 before the burgundian union the dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county the burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began the new rulers defended dutch trading interests which then developed rapidly the fleets of the county of holland defeated the fleets of the hanseatic league several times amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in europe for grain from the baltic region amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of belgium northern france and england this trade was vital because holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained under habsburg charles v ruler of the holy roman empire and king of spain all fiefs in the current netherlands region were united into the seventeen provinces which also included most of present-day belgium luxembourg and some adjacent land in what is now france and germany in 1568 the eighty years war between the provinces and their spanish ruler began the level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a dutch chroniclers report on more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers who had been taken prisoners in the enemys ranks a spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes on one occasion a surgeon at veer cut the heart from a spanish prisoner nailed it on a vessels prow and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it which many did with savage satisfaction the duke of alba ruthlessly attempted to suppress the protestant movement in the netherlands netherlanders were burned strangled beheaded or buried alive by his blood council and his spanish soldiers severed heads and decapitated corpses were displayed along streets and roads to terrorize the population into submission alba boasted of having executed 18600 but this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine the first great siege was albas effort to capture haarlem and thereby cut holland in half it dragged on from december 1572 to the next summer when haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 july upon promise that the city would be spared from being sacked it was a stipulation don fadrique was unable to honor when his soldiers mutinied angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions they endured during the long cold months of the campaign on 4 november 1576 spanish tercios seized antwerp and subjected it to the worst pillage in the netherlands history the citizens resisted but were overcome seven thousand of them were mowed down a thousand buildings were torched men women and children were slaughtered in a delirium of blood by soldiers crying santiago espaa a sangre a carne a fuego a sacco saint james spain to blood to the flesh to fire to sack following the sack of antwerp delegates from catholic brabant and protestant holland and zeeland agreed at ghent to join utrecht and william the silent in driving out all spanish troops and forming a new government for the netherlands don juan of austria the new spanish governor was forced to concede initially but within months returned to active hostilities as the fighting restarted the dutch began to look for help from the queen of england but she initially stood by her commitments to the spanish in the treaty of bristol of 1574 the result was that when the next large-scale battle did occur at gembloux in 1578 the spanish forces easily won the day killing at least 10000 rebels with the spanish suffering few losses in light of the defeat at gembloux the southern states of the seventeen provinces today in northern france and belgium distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 union of arras which expressed their loyalty to philip ii of spain opposing them the northern half of the seventeen provinces forged the union of utrecht also of 1579 in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the spanish army the union of utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern netherlands spanish troops sacked maastricht in 1579 killing over 10000 civilians and thereby ensuring the rebellion continued in 1581 the northern provinces adopted the act of abjuration the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed philip ii as reigning monarch in the northern provinces against the rebels philip could draw on the resources of spain spanish america spanish italy and the spanish netherlands the protestant queen elizabeth i of england sympathised with the dutch struggle against the spanish and sent an army of 7600 soldiers to aid the dutch in their war with the catholic spanish english forces under the earl of leicester and then lord willoughby faced the spanish in the netherlands under the duke of parma in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of spanish troops and bought time for the dutch to reorganise their defenses the war continued until 1648 when spain under king philip iv finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the peace of mnster parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire dutch republic 15811795 after declaring their independence the provinces of holland zeeland groningen friesland utrecht overijssel and gelderland formed a confederation all these duchies lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government the states-provincial the states general the confederal government were seated in the hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces the sparsely populated region of drenthe was part of the republic too although it was not considered one of the provinces moreover the republic had come to occupy during the eighty years war a number of so-called generality lands in flanders brabant and limburg their population was mainly roman catholic and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own and were used as a buffer zone between the republic and the spanish-controlled southern netherlands in the dutch golden age spanning much of the 17th century the dutch empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers alongside portugal spain france and england science military and art especially painting were among the most acclaimed in the world by 1650 the dutch-owned 16000 merchant ships the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company established colonies and trading posts all over the world including ruling the northern parts of taiwan between 16241662 and 16641667 the dutch settlement in north america began with the founding of new amsterdam on the southern part of manhattan in 1614 in south africa the dutch settled the cape colony in 1652 dutch colonies in south america were established along the many rivers in the fertile guyana plains among them colony of surinam now suriname in asia the dutch established the dutch east indies now indonesia and the only western trading post in japan dejima many economic historians regard the netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world in early modern europe it had the wealthiest trading city amsterdam and the first full-time stock exchange the inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle the worlds first asset-inflation bubble the tulip mania of 16361637 and the worlds first bear raider isaac le maire who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount in 1672 known in dutch history as the rampjaar disaster year the dutch republic was at war with france england and three german bishoprics simultaneously at sea it could successfully prevent the english and french navy entering the western shores on land however it was almost taken over internally by the advancing french and german armies coming from the east it managed to turn the tide by inundating parts of holland but could never recover to its former glory again and went into a state of general decline in the 18th century with economic competition from england and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in dutch society the republican staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the prinsgezinden as main political factions batavian republic and kingdom 17951890 with the armed support of revolutionary france dutch republicans proclaimed the batavian republic modelled after the french republic and rendering the netherlands a unitary state on 19 january 1795 the stadtholder william v of orange had fled to england but from 1806 to 1810 the kingdom of holland was set up by napoleon bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother louis bonaparte to control the netherlands more effectively however king louis bonaparte tried to serve dutch interests instead of his brothers and he was forced to abdicate on 1 july 1810 the emperor sent in an army and the netherlands became part of the french empire until the autumn of 1813 when napoleon was defeated in the battle of leipzig william frederick son of the last stadtholder returned to the netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself sovereign prince of the netherlands two years later the congress of vienna added the southern netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of france william frederick raised this united netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself king william i in 1815 in addition william became hereditary grand duke of luxembourg in exchange for his german possessions however the southern netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581 and rebelled the south gained independence in 1830 as belgium recognised by the northern netherlands in 1839 as the kingdom of the netherlands was created by decree while the personal union between luxembourg and the netherlands was severed in 1890 when william iii died with no surviving male heirs ascendancy laws prevented his daughter queen wilhelmina from becoming the next grand duchess the belgian revolution at home and the java war in the dutch east indies brought the netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy however the cultivation system was introduced in 1830 in the dutch east indies 20 of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export the policy brought the dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient the netherlands abolished slavery in 1863 as the last country in europe to do so furthermore slaves in suriname would be fully free only in 1873 since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition the dutch were also one of the last european countries to industrialise in the second half of the 19th century world wars and beyond 1890present the netherlands were able to remain neutral during world war i in part because the import of goods through the netherlands proved essential to german survival until the blockade by the british royal navy in 1916 that changed in world war ii when nazi germany invaded the netherlands on 10 may 1940 the rotterdam blitz forced the main element of the dutch army to surrender four days later during the occupation over 100000 dutch jews were rounded up and transported to nazi extermination camps only a few of them survived dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in germany civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on german soldiers and the countryside was plundered for food although there were thousands of dutch who risked their lives by hiding jews from the germans over 20000 dutch fascists joined the waffen ss fighting on the eastern front political collaborators were members of the fascist nsb the only legal political party in the occupied netherlands on 8 december 1941 the dutch government-in-exile in london declared war on japan but could not prevent the japanese occupation of the dutch east indies indonesia in 194445 the first canadian army which included canadian british and polish troops was responsible for liberating much of the netherlands soon after ve day the dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of indonesia in 1954 the charter for the kingdom of the netherlands reformed the political structure of the netherlands which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation the dutch colonies of surinam and curaao and dependencies and the european country all became countries within the kingdom on a basis of equality indonesia had declared its independence in august 1945 recognised in 1949 and thus was never part of the reformed kingdom suriname followed in 1975 after the war the netherlands left behind an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states the netherlands was one of the founding members of the benelux the nato euratom and the european coal and steel community which would evolve into the eec common market and later the european union government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500000 dutch people to leave the country after the war the 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change such as rapid ontzuiling end of pillarisation a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines youths and students in particular rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as womens rights sexuality disarmament and environmental issues in 2002 the euro was introduced as fiat money and in 2010 the netherlands antilles was dissolved referendums were held on each island to determine their future status as a result the islands of bonaire sint eustatius and saba the bes islands were to obtain closer ties with the netherlands this led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the netherlands antilles the special municipalities are collectively known as the caribbean netherlands geography according to the central bureau of statistics the european netherlands has a total land area of 41528km including non-tidal water bodies it lies between latitudes 50 and 54 n and longitudes 3 and 8 e the netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country with about 26 of its area and 21 of its population located below sea level and only about 50 of its land exceeding one metre above sea level the european part of the country is for the most part flat with the exception of foothills in the far southeast up to a height of no more than 321 metres and some low hill ranges in the central parts most of the areas below sea level are man-made caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation since the late 16th century large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes canals and pumping stations nearly 17 of the countrys land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large european rivers the rhine rijn the meuse maas and the scheldt schelde as well as their tributaries the south-western part of the netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers the rhine-meuse-scheldt delta the european netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the rhine the waal its main tributary branch and the meuse in the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the dutch call their great rivers de grote rivieren another significant branch of the rhine the ijssel river discharges into lake ijssel the former zuiderzee southern sea just like the previous this river forms a linguistic divide people to the northeast of this river speak dutch low saxon dialects except for the province of friesland which has its own language floods over the centuries the dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134 which created the archipelago of zeeland in the south-west on 14 december 1287 st lucias flood affected the netherlands and germany killing more than 50000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history the st elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder replacing it with the 72-square-kilometre 28sqmi biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south-centre the huge north sea flood of early february 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the netherlands more than 1800 people drowned in the flood the dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme the delta works to protect the country against future flooding which was completed over a period of more than thirty years the impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland the drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level causing the underlying peat to contract further additionally until the 19th century peat was mined dried and used for fuel further exacerbating the problem centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres even in flooded areas peat extraction continued through turf dredging because of the flooding farming was difficult which encouraged foreign trade the result of which was that the dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th15th century to guard against floods a series of defences against the water were contrived in the first millennium ad villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps later these terps were connected by dikes in the 12th century local government agencies called waterschappen water boards or hoogheemraadschappen high home councils started to appear whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods these agencies continue to exist as the ground level dropped the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system by the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level the windmills were later used to drain lakes creating the famous polders in 1932 the afsluitdijk closure dike was completed blocking the former zuiderzee southern sea from the north sea and thus creating the ijsselmeer ijssel lake it became part of the larger zuiderzee works in which four polders totalling 2500 square kilometres 965sqmi were reclaimed from the sea the netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change not only is the rising sea a problem but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow delta works after the 1953 disaster the delta works was constructed a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the dutch coast the project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the maeslantkering new projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the delta works a main goal of the delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in south holland and zeeland to once per 10000 years compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country this was achieved by raising 3000 kilometres 1864mi of outer sea-dikes and 10000 kilometres 6214mi of inner canal and river dikes and by closing off the sea estuaries of the zeeland province new risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional delta project dike reinforcements the delta project is considered by the american society of civil engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world it is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level the netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise a politically neutral delta commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 110 metres 36ft and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres 39in the plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like dikes and dunes with 130 metres 43ft of additional flood protection climate change will not only threaten the netherlands from the sea side but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off to protect the country from river flooding another program is already being executed the room for the river plan grants more flow space to rivers protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands the few residents who lived in these so-called overflow areas have been moved to higher ground with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels climate the predominant wind direction in the european netherlands is southwest which causes a mild maritime climate with moderately warm summers and cool winters and typically high humidity this is especially true close to the dutch coastline where the difference in temperature between summer and winter as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country ice daysmaximum temperature below 0c 32fusually occur from december until february with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period freezing daysminimum temperature below 0c 32foccur much more often usually ranging from mid-november to late march but not rarely measured as early as mid-october and as late as mid-may if one chooses the height of measurement to be 10cm 4in above ground instead of 150cm 59in one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer on average snow can occur from november to april but sometimes occurs in may or october too warm daysmaximum temperature above 20c 68fare usually found in april to october but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in march or even sometimes in november or february usually not in de bilt however summer daysmaximum temperature above 25c 77fare usually measured in de bilt from may until september tropical daysmaximum temperature above 30c 86fare rare and usually occur only in june to august precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent the number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in december and nearly 17 hours in june the following tables are based on mean measurements by the knmi weather station in de bilt between 1981 and 2010 nature the netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves that include lakes heathland woods dunes and other habitats most of these are owned by staatsbosbeheer the national department for forestry and nature conservation and natuurmonumenten literally natures monuments a private organisation that buys protects and manages nature reserves the dutch part of the wadden sea in the north with its tidal flats and wetlands is rich in biological diversity and was declared a unesco world heritage nature site in 2009 the oosterschelde formerly the northeast estuary of the river scheldt was designated a national park in 2002 thereby making it the largest national park in the netherlands at an area of 370 square kilometres 140sqmi it consists primarily of the salt waters of the oosterschelde but also includes mud flats meadows and shoals because of the large variety of sea life including unique regional species the park is popular with scuba divers other activities include sailing fishing cycling and bird watching phytogeographically the european netherlands is shared between the atlantic european and central european provinces of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom according to the world wide fund for nature the european territory of the netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of atlantic mixed forests in 1871 the last old original natural woods were cut down and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like scots pine and trees that are not native to the netherlands these woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts overgrazed heaths veluwe caribbean islands while curaao aruba and sint maarten have a constituent country status the caribbean netherlands are three islands designated as special municipalities of the netherlands the islands are part of the lesser antilles and have land and maritime borders with france saint martin maritime borders with france saint barthlemy the united kingdom anguilla venezuela saint kitts and nevis and the united states us virgin islands within this island group bonaire is part of the abc islands within the leeward antilles island chain off the venezuelan coast the leeward antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin saba and sint eustatius are part of the sss islands they are located east of puerto rico and the virgin islands although in the english language they are considered part of the leeward islands french spanish dutch and the english spoken locally consider them part of the windward islands the windward islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly leaving little ground suitable for agriculture the highest point is mount scenery 887 metres 2910ft on saba this is the highest point in the country and is also the highest point of the entire kingdom of the netherlands the islands of the caribbean netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round the leeward antilles are warmer and drier than the windward islands in summer the windward islands can be subject to hurricanes politics the netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and due to the efforts of johan rudolph thorbecke a parliamentary democracy since 1848 the netherlands is described as a consociational state dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues within both the political community and society as a whole in 2017 the economist ranked the netherlands as the 11th most democratic country in the world the monarch is the head of state at present king willem-alexander of the netherlands constitutionally the position is equipped with limited powers by law the king has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs depending on the personalities and relationships of the king and the ministers the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution of the netherlands the executive power is formed by the council of ministers the deliberative organ of the dutch cabinet the cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries one to three ministers are ministers without portfolio the head of government is the prime minister of the netherlands who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition the prime minister is a primus inter pares with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers mark rutte has been prime minister since october 2010 the prime minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973 the cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament the states general which also has legislative powers the 150 members of the house of representatives the lower house are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation these are held every four years or sooner in case the cabinet falls for example when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch the states-provincial are directly elected every four years as well the members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the

and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial economic and social areas they meet regularly with the government in the social-economic council this body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily the netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance in the 18th century while the dutch reformed church was the state religion catholicism other forms of protestantism such as baptists and lutherans and judaism were tolerated but discriminated against in the late 19th century this dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government this tradition of tolerance influences dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs prostitution lgbt rights euthanasia and abortion which are among the most liberal in the world political parties because of the multi-party system no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century and coalition cabinets had to be formed since suffrage became universal in 1917 the dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties the strongest of which were the christian democrats currently represented by the christian democratic appeal cda second were the social democrats represented by the labour party pvda and third were the liberals of which the right-wing peoples party for freedom and democracy vvd is the main representative these parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the christian democrats had always been a partner so either a centre-left coalition of the christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of christian democrats and liberals in the 1970s the party system became more volatile the christian democratic parties lost seats while new parties became successful such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal democrats 66 d66 or the ecologist party groenlinks gl in the 1994 election the cda lost its dominant position a purple cabinet was formed by the vvd d66 and pvda in the 2002 elections this cabinet lost its majority because of an increased support for the cda and the rise of the right lpf a new political party around pim fortuyn who was assassinated a week before the elections a short-lived cabinet was formed by cda vvd and lpf which was led by the cda leader jan peter balkenende after the 2003 elections in which the lpf lost most of its seats a cabinet was formed by the cda vvd and d66 the cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state the healthcare system and immigration policy in june 2006 the cabinet fell after d66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the minister of immigration and integration rita verdonk who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of ayaan hirsi ali a vvd mp a caretaker cabinet was formed by the cda and vvd and general elections were held on 22 november 2006 in these elections the cda remained the largest party and the socialist party made the largest gains the formation of a new cabinet took three months resulting in a coalition of cda pvda and christian union on 20 february 2010 the cabinet fell when the pvda refused to prolong the involvement of the dutch army in uruzgan afghanistan snap elections were held on 9 june 2010 with devastating results for the previously largest party the cda which lost about half of its seats resulting in 21 seats the vvd became the largest party with 31 seats closely followed by the pvda with 30 seats the big winner of the 2010 elections was geert wilders whose right wing pvv the ideological successor to the lpf more than doubled its number of seats negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government led by vvd a first in coalition with cda which was sworn in on 14 october 2010 this unprecedented minority government was supported by pvv but proved ultimately to be unstable when on 21 april 2012 wilders leader of pvv unexpectedly torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks on new austerity measures paving the way for early elections vvd and pvda won a majority in the house of representatives during the 2012 general election on 5 november 2012 they formed the second rutte cabinet after the 2017 general election vvd christian democratic appeal democrats 66 and christenunie formed the third rutte cabinet government administrative divisions the netherlands is divided into twelve provinces each under a kings commissioner commissaris van de koning except for limburg province where the position is named governor gouverneur but has the same tasks all provinces are divided into municipalities gemeenten of which there are 380 2018 the country is also subdivided into 24 water districts governed by a water board waterschap or hoogheemraadschap each having authority in matters concerning water management the creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself the first appearing in 1196 the dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence direct elections of the water boards take place every 4 years the administrative structure on the 3 bes islands collectively known as the caribbean netherlands is different these islands have the status of openbare lichamen public bodies rather than municipalities and as administrative units are generally referred to as special municipalities they are not part of a province the netherlands has several belgian exclaves and within those even several enclaves which are still part of the province of north brabant because the netherlands and belgium are both in the schengen area citizens of respective countries can travel through these enclaves foreign relations the history of dutch foreign policy has been characterised by its neutrality since world war ii the netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations most prominently the un nato and the eu the dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on international trade the foreign policy of the netherlands is based on four basic commitments to atlantic co-operation to european integration to international development and to international law one of the more controversial international issues surrounding the netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs during and after the dutch golden age the dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire the most important colonies were present-day suriname and indonesia indonesia became independent after the indonesian national revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence international pressure and several united nations security council resolutions suriname became independent in 1975 the historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the netherlands in addition many people from these countries are living permanently in the netherlands military the netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in europe it was first established as such by maurice of nassau in the late 1500s the dutch army was used throughout the dutch empire after the defeat of napoleon the dutch army was transformed into a conscription army the army was unsuccessfully deployed during the belgian revolution in 1830 after 1830 it was deployed mainly in the dutch colonies as the netherlands remained neutral in european wars including the first world war until the netherlands was invaded in world war ii and defeated by the wehrmacht in may 1940 the netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the treaty of brussels and became a founding member of nato in 1949 the dutch military was therefore part of the nato strength in cold war europe deploying its army to several bases in germany more than 3000 dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd infantry division of the united states army during the korean war in 1996 conscription was suspended and the dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army since the 1990s the dutch army has been involved in the bosnian war and the kosovo war it held a province in iraq after the defeat of saddam hussein and it was engaged in afghanistan the military is composed of four branches all of which carry the prefix koninklijke royal koninklijke landmacht kl the royal netherlands army koninklijke marine km the royal netherlands navy including the naval air service and marine corps koninklijke luchtmacht

competitiveness report natural gas beginning in the 1950s the netherlands discovered huge natural gas resources the sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the netherlands for decades adding hundreds of billions of euros to the governments budget however the unforeseen consequences of the countrys huge energy wealth impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy leading to the theory of dutch disease apart from coal and gas the country has no mining resources the last coal mine was closed in 1974 the groningen gas field one of the largest natural gas fields in the world is situated near slochteren exploitation of this field has resulted in 159billion in revenue since the mid-1970s the field is operated by government-owned gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government royal dutch shell and exxon mobil through nam nederlandse aardolie maatschappij gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors some measuring as much as

cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward and contains many dairy products breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings with cereal for breakfast as an alternative traditionally dinner consists of potatoes a portion of meat and seasonal vegetables the dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country without many refinements it is best described as rustic though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods in the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of dutch cuisine the regions in the northeast of the netherlands roughly the provinces of groningen friesland drenthe overijssel and gelderland north of the great rivers are the least populated area of the netherlands the late 18th century introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats the relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry though dishes near the coastal regions of friesland groningen and the parts of overijssel bordering the ijsselmeer also include a large amount of fish the various dried sausages belonging to the metworst-family of dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste also smoked sausages are common of which gelderse rookworst is the most renowned the sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot hutspot or zuurkool sauerkraut whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food the provinces are also home to hard textured rye bread pastries and cookies the latter heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat various kinds of kruidkoek such as groninger koek fryske dmkes and spekdikken small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron are considered typical notable characteristics of fries roggebrood frisian rye bread is its long baking time up to 20 hours resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour in terms of alcoholic beverages the region is renowned for its many bitters such as beerenburg and other high-proof liquors rather than beer which is apart from jenever typical for the rest of the country as a coastal region friesland is home to low-lying grasslands and thus has a cheese production in common with the western cuisine friese nagelkaas friesian clove is a notable example the provinces of north holland south holland zeeland utrecht and the gelderlandic region of betuwe are the parts of the netherlands which make up the region in which western dutch cuisine is found because of the abundance of water and flat grass lands that are found here the area is known for its many dairy products which includes prominent cheeses such as gouda leyden spiced cheese with cumin edam traditionally in small spheres as well as leerdammer and beemster while the adjacent zaanstreek in north holland is since the 16th century known for its mayonnaise typical whole-grain mustards and chocolate industry zeeland and south holland produce a lot of butter which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other european butter varieties a by-product of the butter-making process karnemelk buttermilk is also considered typical for this region seafood such as soused herring mussels called zeeuwse mossels since all dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in zeelands oosterschelde eels oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region kibbeling once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish has become a national fast food just as lekkerbek pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy and often contain large amounts of sugar either caramelised powdered or crystallised the oliebol in its modern form and zeeuwse bolus are good examples cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar like stroopwafel as well as a filling of some kind mostly almond like gevulde koek the traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer strong pale lager and jenever a high proof juniper-flavored spirit that came to be known in england as gin a noted exception within the traditional dutch alcoholic landscape advocaat a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs sugar and brandy is also native to this region the southern dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the dutch provinces of north brabant and limburg and the flemish region in belgium it is renowned for its many rich pastries soups stews and vegetable dishes and is often called burgundian which is a dutch idiom invoking the rich burgundian court which ruled the low countries in the middle ages renowned for its splendor and great feasts it is the only dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine pastries are abundant often with rich fillings of cream custard or fruits cakes such as the vlaai from limburg and the moorkop and bossche bol from brabant are typical pastries savoury pastries also occur with the worstenbroodje a roll with a sausage of ground beef literally translates into sausage bread being the most popular the traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer there are many local brands ranging from trappist to kriek 5 of the 10 international trappist association recognised breweries in the world are located in the southern dutch cultural area beer like wine in french cuisine is also used in cooking often in stews in early 2014 oxfam ranked the netherlands as the country with the most nutritious plentiful and healthy food in a comparison of 125 countries colonial heritage from the exploitations of the dutch east india company in the 17th century to the colonisations in the 19th century dutch imperial possessions continued to expand reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the dutch east indies in the early 20th century the dutch east indies which later formed modern-day indonesia was one of the most valuable european colonies in the world and the most important one for the netherlands over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the netherlands in the dutch golden age of the 17th century the netherlands urbanised considerably mostly financed by corporate revenue from the asian trade monopolies social status was based on merchants income which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of dutch society when the dutch royal family was established in 1815 much of its wealth came from colonial trade by the 17th century the dutch east india company established their base in parts of ceylon modern-day sri lanka afterward they established ports in dutch occupied malabar leading to dutch settlements and trading posts in india however their expansion into india was halted after their defeat in the battle of colachel by the kingdom of travancore during the travancore-dutch war the dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to india universities such as the royal leiden university founded in the 16th century have developed into leading knowledge centres for southeast asian and indonesian studies leiden university has produced leading academics such as christiaan snouck hurgronje and still has academics who specialise in indonesian languages and cultures leiden university and in particular kitlv are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in indonesian studies other scientific institutions in the netherlands include the amsterdam tropenmuseum an anthropological museum with massive collections of indonesian art culture ethnography and anthropology the traditions of the royal dutch east indies army knil are maintained by the regiment van heutsz of the modern royal netherlands army a dedicated bronbeek museum a former home for retired knil soldiers exists in arnhem to this day a specific segment of dutch literature called dutch indies literature still exists and includes established authors such as louis couperus the writer of the hidden force taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration one of the great masterpieces of dutch literature is the book max havelaar written by multatuli in 1860 the majority of dutchmen that repatriated to the netherlands after and during the indonesian revolution are indo eurasian native to the islands of the dutch east indies this relatively large eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the european legal community in dutch they are referred to as indische nederlanders or as indo short for indo-european including their second generation descendants indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the netherlands in 2008 the dutch central bureau for statistics cbs registered 387000 first- and second-generation indos living in the netherlands although considered fully assimilated into dutch society as the main ethnic minority in the netherlands these repatriants have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of indonesian culture into dutch mainstream culture practically every town in the netherlands has a toko dutch indonesian shop or a chinese-indonesian restaurant and many pasar malam night market in malayindonesian fairs are organised throughout the year many indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the netherlands rijsttafel a colonial culinary concept and dishes such as nasi goreng and satay are very popular in the netherlands see also netherlands portal outline of the netherlands notes definitions
