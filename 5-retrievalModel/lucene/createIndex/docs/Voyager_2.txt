voyager 2 is a space probe launched by nasa on august 20 1977 to study the outer planets part of the voyager program it was launched 16 days before its twin voyager 1 on a trajectory that took longer to reach jupiter and saturn but enabled further encounters with uranus and neptune it is the only spacecraft to have visited either of these two ice giant planets its primary mission ended with the exploration of the neptunian system on october 2 1989 after having visited the uranian system in 1986 the saturnian system in 1981 and the jovian system in 1979 voyager 2 is now in its extended mission to study the outer reaches of the solar system and has been operating for 41years 5months and 30days as of 19 february 2019 it remains in contact through the nasa deep space network at a distance of 119au 17810km about 165 light-hours from the sun as of late 2018 moving at a velocity of 15341kms 55230kmh relative to the sun voyager 2 is the fourth of five spacecraft to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the solar system the probe left the heliosphere for interstellar space on november 5 2018 becoming the second artificial object to do so and has begun to provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma history background in the early space age it was realized that a periodic alignment of the outer planets would occur in the late 1970s and enable a single probe to visit jupiter saturn uranus and neptune by taking advantage of the then-new technique of gravity assists nasa began work on a grand tour which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each with one group visiting jupiter saturn and pluto and the other jupiter uranus and neptune the spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival through the entire tour by 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two mariner-derived spacecraft the mariner jupiter-saturn probes to keep apparent lifetime program costs low the mission would include only flybys of jupiter and saturn but keep the grand tour option open as the program progressed the name was changed to voyager the primary mission of voyager 1 was to explore jupiter saturn and saturns moon titan voyager 2 was also to explore jupiter and saturn but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to uranus and neptune or being redirected to titan as a backup for voyager 1 upon successful completion of voyager 1s objectives voyager 2 would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards uranus and neptune spacecraft design constructed by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl voyager 2 included 16 hydrazine thrusters three-axis stabilization gyroscopes and celestial referencing instruments sun sensorcanopus star tracker to maintain pointing of the high-gain antenna toward earth collectively these instruments are part of the attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters the spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space communications built with the intent for eventual interstellar travel voyager 2 included a large 37m 12ft parabolic high-gain antenna see diagram to transceive data via the deep space network on the earth communications are conducted over the s-band about 13cm wavelength and x-band about 36cm wavelength providing data rates as high as 1152 kilobits per second at the distance of jupiter and then ever-decreasing as the distance increased because of the inverse-square law when the spacecraft is unable to communicate with earth the digital tape recorder dtr can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time power voyager 2 is equipped with 3 multihundred-watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators mhw rtg each rtg includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres and provided enough heat to generate approximately 157 w of electrical power at launch collectively the rtgs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch halving every 877 years and will allow operations to continue until at least 2020 rtg inner heat source rtg inner heat source rtg assembly rtg assembly rtg unit rtg unit attitude control and propulsion because of the energy required to achieve a jupiter trajectory boost with an 1819-pound 825kg payload the spacecraft included a propulsion module made of a 2476-pound 1125kg solid-rocket motor and eight hydrazine monopropellant rocket engines four providing pitch and yaw attitude control and four for roll control the propulsion module was jettisoned shortly after the successful jupiter burn sixteen hydrazine mr-103 thrusters on the mission module provide attitude control four are used to execute trajectory correction maneuvers the others in two redundant six-thruster branches to stabilize the spacecraft on its three axes only one branch of attitude control thrusters is needed at any time thrusters are supplied by a single 28-inch 70cm diameter spherical titanium tank it contained 230 pounds 100kg of hydrazine at launch providing

cape canaveral florida aboard a titan iiiecentaur launch vehicle two weeks later the twin voyager 1 probe was launched on september 5 1977 however voyager 1 reached both jupiter and saturn sooner as voyager 2 had been launched into a longer more circular trajectory voyager 2 launch on august 20 1977 with a titan iiiecentaur voyager 2 launch on august 20 1977 with a titan iiiecentaur animation of

accelerate the spacecraft by jupiter saturn and uranus to observe triton voyager 2 passed over neptunes north pole resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and as a result a reduced velocity relative to the sun in april 1978 a complication arose when no commands were transmitted to voyager 2 for a period of time causing the spacecraft to switch from its primary radio receiver to its backup receiver sometime afterwards the primary receiver failed altogether the backup receiver was functional but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency and this frequency would be affected by the earths rotation due to the doppler effect and the onboard receivers temperature among other things for each subsequent transmission to voyager 2 it was necessary for engineers to calculate the specific frequency for the signal so that it could be received by the spacecraft encounter with jupiter voyager 2s closest approach to jupiter occurred at 2229 ut on july 9 1979 it came within 570000km 350000mi of the planets cloud tops jupiters great red spot was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds voyager 2 returned images of jupiter as well as its moons amalthea io callisto ganymede and europa during a 10-hour volcano watch it confirmed voyager 1s observations of active volcanism on the moon io and revealed how the moons surface had changed in the four months since the previous visit together the voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on io and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the two voyager fly-bys jupiters moon europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from voyager 1 at first scientists believed the features might be deep cracks caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes closer high-resolution photos from voyager 2 however were puzzling the features lacked topographic and one scientist said they might have been painted on with a felt marker europa is internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that of io europa is thought to have a thin crust less than 30km 19mi thick of water ice possibly floating on a 50-kilometer-deep 30 mile ocean two new small satellites adrastea and metis were found orbiting just outside the ring a third new satellite thebe was discovered between the orbits of amalthea and io the great red spot photographed during the

behind saturn as viewed from earth voyager 2 probed saturns upper atmosphere with its radio link to gather information on atmospheric temperature and density profiles voyager 2 found that at the uppermost pressure levels seven kilopascals of pressure saturns temperature was 70 kelvins 203c while at the deepest levels measured 120 kilopascals the temperature increased to 143k 130c the north pole was found to be 10 kelvins cooler although this may be seasonal see also saturn oppositions after the fly-by of saturn the camera platform of voyager 2 locked up briefly putting plans to officially extend the mission to uranus and neptune in jeopardy the missions engineers were able to fix the problem caused by an overuse that temporarily depleted its lubricant and the voyager 2 probe

with uranus the closest approach to uranus occurred on january 24 1986 when voyager 2 came within 81500 kilometers 50600mi of the planets cloudtops voyager 2 also discovered 11 previously unknown moons cordelia ophelia bianca cressida desdemona juliet portia rosalind belinda puck and perdita the mission also studied the planets unique atmosphere caused by its axial tilt of 978 and examined the uranian ring system the length of a day on uranus as measured by voyager 2 is 17 hours 14 minutes uranus was shown to have a magnetic field that was misaligned with its rotational axis unlike other planets that had been visited to that point and a helix-shaped magnetic tail stretching 10 million kilometers 6 million miles away from the sun when voyager 2 visited uranus much of its cloud features were hidden by a layer of haze however false-color and contrast-enhanced images show bands of concentric clouds around its south pole this area was also found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light a phenomenon that is called dayglow the average atmospheric temperature is about 60k 350f213c surprisingly the illuminated and dark poles and most of the planet exhibit nearly the same temperatures at the cloud tops detailed images from voyager 2s flyby of the uranian moon miranda showed huge canyons made from geological faults one hypothesis suggests that miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact voyager 2 discovered two previously-unknown uranian rings measurements showed that the uranian rings are distinctly different from those at jupiter and saturn the uranian ring system might be relatively young and it did not form at the same time that uranus did the particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high-velocity impact or torn up by tidal effects uranus as viewed by voyager 2 uranus as viewed by voyager 2 departing image

through repeated computerized test simulations of trajectories through the neptunian system conducted in advance flight controllers determined the best way to route voyager 2 through the neptune-triton system since the plane of the orbit of triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic through mid-course corrections voyager 2 was directed into a path about 4950 kilometers 3000mi above the north pole of neptune five hours after voyager 2 made its closest approach to neptune it performed a close fly-by of triton the larger of neptunes two originally known moons passing within about 40000 kilometers 25000mi voyager 2 discovered previously unknown neptunian rings and confirmed six new moons despina galatea larissa proteus naiad and thalassa while in the neighborhood of neptune voyager 2 discovered the great dark spot which has since disappeared according to observations by the hubble space telescope the great dark spot was later hypothesized to be a region of clear gas forming a window in the planets high-altitude methane cloud deck with the decision of the international astronomical union to reclassify pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 the flyby of neptune by voyager 2 in 1989 became the point when every known planet in the solar system had been visited at least once by a space probe voyager 2 image of neptune voyager 2 image of neptune

was described as working on an interstellar mission which nasa is using to find out what the solar system is like beyond the heliosphere voyager 2 is currently transmitting scientific data at about 160 bits per second information about continuing telemetry exchanges with voyager 2 is available from voyager weekly reports in 1992 voyager 2 observed the nova v1974 cygni in the far-ultraviolet in july 1994 an attempt was made to observe the impacts from fragments of the comet comet shoemakerlevy 9 with jupiter the crafts position meant it had a direct line of sight to the impacts and observations were made in the ultraviolet and radio spectrum voyager 2 failed to detect anything with calculations showing that the fireballs were just below the crafts limit of detection on november 29 2006 a telemetered command to voyager 2 was incorrectly decoded by its on-board computerin a random erroras a command to turn on the electrical heaters of the spacecrafts magnetometer these heaters remained turned on until december 4 2006 and during that time there was a resulting high temperature above 130c 266f significantly higher than the magnetometers were designed to endure and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation as of this date it had not been possible to fully diagnose and correct for the damage caused to voyager 2s magnetometer although efforts to do so were proceeding on august 30 2007 voyager 2 passed the termination shock and then entered into the heliosheath approximately 1 billion miles 16 billion km closer to the sun than voyager 1 did this is due to the interstellar magnetic field of deep space the southern hemisphere of the solar systems heliosphere is being pushed in on april 22 2010 voyager 2 encountered scientific data format problems on may 17 2010 jpl engineers revealed that a flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the issue and scheduled a bit reset for may 19 on may 23 2010 voyager 2 resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit currently research is being made into marking the area of memory with the flipped bit off limits or disallowing its use the low-energy charged particle instrument is currently operational and data from this instrument concerning charged particles is being transmitted to earth this data permits measurements of the heliosheath and termination shock there has also been a modification to the on-board flight software to delay turning off the ap branch 2 backup heater for one year it was scheduled to go off february 2 2011 doy 033 2011033 on july 25 2012 voyager 2 was traveling at 15447kms relative to the sun at about 9913 astronomical units 1483010km from the sun at 5529 declination and 19888 h right ascension and also at an ecliptic latitude of 340 degrees placing it in the constellation telescopium as observed from earth this location places it deep in the scattered disc and traveling outward at roughly 3264 au per year it is more than twice as far from the sun as pluto and far beyond the perihelion of 90377 sedna but not yet beyond the outer limits of the orbit of the dwarf planet eris on september 9 2012 voyager 2 was 99077au 14821710km 9209810mi from the earth and 99504au 14885610km 9249510mi from the sun and traveling at 15436kms 34530mph relative to the sun and traveling outward at about 3256 au per year sunlight takes 1373 hours to get to voyager 2 the brightness of the sun from the spacecraft is magnitude -167 voyager 2 is heading in the direction of the constellation telescopium to compare proxima centauri the closest star to the sun is about 42 light-years or 701639643435735500026510au distant voyager 2s current relative velocity to the sun is 15436kms 55570kmh 34530mph this calculates as 3254 au per year about 10 slower than voyager 1 at this velocity 81438 years would pass before voyager 2 reaches the nearest star proxima centauri were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star voyager 2 will need about 19390 years at its current velocity to travel a complete light year on november 7 2012 voyager 2 reached 100 au from the sun making it the third human-made object to reach 100 au voyager 1 was 122 au from the sun and pioneer 10 is presumed to be at 107 au while pioneer has ceased communications both the voyager spacecraft are performing well and are still communicating in 2013 voyager 1 was escaping the solar system at a speed of about 36 au per year while voyager 2 was only escaping at 33 au per year each year voyager 1 increases its lead over voyager 2 by november 2 2018 voyager 2 was at a distance of 119au 17810km from the sun there is a variation in distance from earth caused by the earths revolution around the sun relative to voyager 2 it was originally thought that voyager 2 would enter interstellar space in early 2016 with its plasma spectrometer providing the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma in december 2018 the voyager project scientist edward c stone announced that voyager 2 reached interstellar space on november 5 2018 future of the probe voyager 2 is not headed toward any particular star although in roughly 40000 years it should pass 17 light-years from the star ross 248 and if undisturbed for 296000 years voyager 2 should pass by the star sirius at a distance of 43 light-years voyager 2 is expected to keep transmitting weak radio messages until at least the mid 2020s more than 48 years after it was launched golden record each voyager space probe carries a gold-plated audio-visual disc
