the indigenous peoples of europe are the focus of european ethnology the field of anthropology related to the various indigenous groups that reside in the nations of europe according to german monograph minderheitenrechte in europa co-edited by pan and pfeil 2002 there are 87 distinct peoples of europe of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities the total number of national or linguistic minority populations in europe is estimated at 105 million people or 14 of 770 million europeans there are no universally accepted and precise definitions of the terms ethnic group and nationality in the context of european ethnography in particular the terms ethnic group people nationality and ethno-linguistic group are used as mostly synonymous although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of europe overview there are eight european ethno-linguistic groups with more than 30 million members residing in europe these eight groups between themselves account for some 465 million or about 65 of european population russians over 100 million residing in europe germans c 93 million french c 75 million british c 66 million italians c 60 million ukrainians 3855 million spaniards 4150 million poles 3845 million smaller ethno-linguistic groups with more than 10 million people residing in europe include romanians 2025 million dutch 1525 million turks 1020 million in europe portuguese 1015 million swedes 1015 million greeks 1015 million czechs c 10 million hungarians c 10 million serbs c 10 million about 2025 million residents 3 are members of diasporas of non-european origin the population of the european union with some five hundred million residents accounts for two thirds of the european population both spain and the united kingdom are special cases in that the designation of nationality spanish and british may controversially take ethnic aspects subsuming various regional ethnic groups see nationalisms and regionalisms of spain and native populations of the united kingdom switzerland is a similar case but the linguistic subgroups of the swiss are discussed in terms of both ethnicity and language affiliations linguistic classifications of the total population of europe of some 740 million as of 2010 close to 90 or some 650 million fall within three large branches of indo-european languages these being slavic including russian ukrainian polish croatian macedonian czech bosnian bulgarian slovenian serbian slovak belarusian rusyn language and ruthenian romance including italian french spanish romanian portuguese catalan galician corsican friulian aromanian walloon romansh and

some south african and namibian migrant populations three stand-alone indo-european languages do not fall within larger sub-groups and are not closely related to those larger language families greek about 12 million albanian about 6 million armenian about 35 million in addition there are also smaller sub-groups within the indo-european languages of europe including baltic including latvian and lithuanian celtic including welsh breton irish gaelic scots gaelic cornish and manx iranic mainly ossetian in europe as well as kurdish spoken mainly in turkey indo-aryan is represented by the romani language spoken by roma people of eastern europe and is at root related to the indo-aryan languages of the indian sub-continent besides the indo-european languages there are other language families on the european continent which are wholly unrelated to indo-european uralic languages including hungarian finnish estonian livonian mordvin samoyedic sami komi udmurt and mari turkic languages including turkish azeri tatar nogai bashkir and chuvash semitic languages including maltese assyrian neo-aramaic spoken in parts of eastern turkey and the caucasus by assyrian christians and hebrew the latter

kabardian ubykh adyghe abkhaz and abaza northeast caucasian languages including chechen avar lak lezgian ingush and nakho-dagestanian language isolates basque spoken in the basque regions of spain and france is an isolate language the only one in europe and is unrelated to any other language living or extinct mongolic languages exist in the form of kalmyk spoken in the caucasus region of russia history prehistoric populations the basques have been found to descend from the population of the late neolithic or early bronze age directly the indo-european groups of europe the centum groups plus balto-slavic and albanian are assumed to have developed in situ by admixture of bronze age proto-indo-european groups with earlier mesolithic and neolithic populations after migrating to most of europe from the pontic steppe yamnaya culture corded ware beaker people the finnic peoples are assumed to also be descended from proto-uralic populations further to the east nearer to the ural mountains that had migrated to their historical homelands in europe by about 3000 years ago reconstructed languages of iron age europe include proto-celtic proto-italic and proto-germanic all of these indo-european languages of the centum group and proto-slavic and proto-baltic of the satem group a group of tyrrhenian languages appears to have included etruscan rhaetian lemnian and perhaps camunic a pre-roman stage of proto-basque can only be reconstructed with great uncertainty regarding the european bronze age the only secure reconstruction is that of proto-greek ca 2000 bc a proto-italo-celtic ancestor of both italic and celtic assumed for the bell beaker period and a proto-balto-slavic language assumed for roughly the corded ware horizon has been postulated with less confidence old european hydronymy has been taken as indicating an early bronze age indo-european predecessor of the later centum languages historical populations iron age pre-great migrations

antiquity herodotus described the scythians and thraco-illyrians dicaearchus gave a description of greece itself besides accounts of western and northern europe his work survives only fragmentarily but was received by polybius and others roman empire period authors include diodorus siculus strabo and tacitus julius caesar gives an account of the celtic tribes of gaul while tacitus describes the germanic tribes of magna germania a number of authors like diodorus siculus pausanias and sallust depicts the ancient sardinian and corsican peoples the 4th century tabula peutingeriana records the

1741 synopsis universae philologiae published what is probably the earliest ethno-linguistic map of europe showing the beginning of the pater noster in the various european languages and scripts in the 19th century ethnicity was discussed in terms of scientific racism and the ethnic groups of europe were grouped into a number of races mediterranean alpine and nordic all part of a larger caucasian group the beginnings of ethnic geography as an academic subdiscipline lie in the period following world war i in the context of nationalism and in the 1930s exploitation for the purposes of fascist and nazi propaganda so that it was only in the 1960s that ethnic geography began to thrive as a bona fide academic subdiscipline the origins of modern ethnography are often traced to the work of bronisaw malinowski who emphasized the importance of fieldwork the emergence of population genetics further undermined the categorisation of europeans into clearly defined racial groups a 2007 study on the genetic history of europe found that the most important genetic differentiation in europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east northern europe to the balkans with another east-west axis of differentiation across europe separating the indigenous basques and sami from other european populations despite these stratifications it noted the unusually high degree of european homogeneity there is low apparent diversity in europe with the entire continent-wide samples only marginally more dispersed than single population samples elsewhere in the world minorities the total number of national minority populations in europe is estimated at 105 million people or 14 of europeans the member states of the council of europe in 1995 signed the framework convention for the protection of national minorities the broad aims of the convention are to ensure that the signatory states respect the rights of national minorities undertaking to combat discrimination promote equality preserve and develop the culture and identity of national minorities guarantee certain freedoms in relation to access to the media minority languages and education and encourage the participation of national minorities in public life the framework convention for the protection of national minorities defines a national minority implicitly to include minorities possessing a territorial identity and a distinct cultural heritage by 2008 39 member states have signed and ratified the convention with the notable exception of france non-indigenous minorities many non-european ethnic groups and nationalities have immigrated to europe over the centuries some arrived centuries ago while others immigrated more recently in the 20th century often from former colonies of the

expressed in terms of genealogy of mythical founders of the individual groups the europeans were considered the descendants of japheth from early times corresponding to the division of the known world into three continents the descendants of shem peopling asia and those of ham peopling africa identification of europeans as japhetites is also reflected in early suggestions for terming the indo-european languages japhetic in this tradition the historia brittonum 9th century introduces a genealogy of the peoples of the migration period as it was remembered in early medieval historiography as follows the text goes then on to list the genealogy of alanus connecting him to japheth via eighteen generations european culture european culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its common cultural heritage due to the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject it is impossible to form a single all-embracing conception of european culture nonetheless there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern europe one list of these elements given by k bochmann includes a common cultural and spiritual heritage derived from greco-roman antiquity christianity the renaissance and its humanism the political thinking of the enlightenment and the french revolution and the developments of modernity including all types of socialism a rich and dynamic material culture that has been extended to the other continents as the result of industrialization and colonialism during the great divergence a specific conception of the individual expressed by the existence of and respect for a legality that guarantees human rights and the liberty of the individual a plurality of states with different political orders which are condemned to live together in one way or another respect for peoples states and nations outside europe berting says that these points fit with europes most positive realisations the concept of european culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the western world in this definition western culture is the set of literary scientific political artistic and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the western canon the term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by european immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries such as the americas and australasia and is not restricted to europe religion since the high middle ages most of europe is dominated by christianity there are three major denominations roman catholic protestant and eastern orthodox with protestantism restricted mostly to northern europe and orthodoxy to east and south slavic regions romania greece and georgia also the armenian apostolic church part of the oriental church is in europe - another branch of christianity worlds oldest national church catholicism while typically centered in western europe also has a very significant following in central europe especially among the germanic western slavic and hungarian peoplesregions as well as in ireland with some in great britain christianity has been the dominant religion shaping european culture for at least the last 1700 years modern philosophical thought has very much been influenced by christian philosophers such as st thomas aquinas and erasmus and throughout most of its history europe has been nearly equivalent to christian culture the christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization guiding the course of philosophy art and science the notion of europe and the western world has been intimately connected with the concept of christianity and christendom many even attribute christianity for being the link that created a unified european identity christianity is still the largest religion in europe according to a 2011 survey 762 of europeans considered themselves christians also according to a study on religiosity in the european union in 2012 by eurobarometer christianity is the largest religion in the european union accounting for 72 of the eus population islam has some tradition in the balkans and the caucasus due to conquest and colonization from the ottoman empire in the 16th to 19th centuries muslims account for the majority of the populations in albania azerbaijan kosovo northern cyprus controlled by turks and bosnia and herzegovina significant minorities are present in the rest of europe russia also has one of the largest muslim communities in europe including the tatars of the middle volga and multiple groups in the caucasus including chechens avars ingush and others with 20th-century migrations muslims in western europe have become a noticeable minority according to the pew forum the total number of muslims in europe in 2010 was about 44 million 6 while the total number of muslims in the european union in 2007 was about 16 million 32 judaism has a long history in europe but is a small minority religion with france 1 the only european country with a jewish population in excess of 05 the jewish population of europe is composed primarily of two groups the ashkenazi and the sephardi ancestors of ashkenazi jews likely migrated to central europe at least as early as the 8th century while sephardi jews established themselves in spain and portugal at least one thousand years before that jews originated in the levant where they resided for thousands of years until the 2nd century ad when they spread around the mediterranean and into europe although small communities were known to exist in greece as well as the balkans since at least the 1st century bc jewish history was notably affected by the holocaust and emigration including aliyah as well as emigration to america in the 20th century in modern times significant secularization since the 20th century notably in laicist france estonia and czech republic currently distribution of theism in europe is very heterogeneous with more than 95 in poland and less than 20 in the czech republic and estonia the 2005 eurobarometer poll found that 52 of eu citizens believe in god pan-european identity pan-european identity or europatriotism is an emerging sense of personal identification with europe or the european union as a result of the gradual process of european integration taking place over the last quarter of the 20th century and especially in the period after the end of the cold war since the 1990s the foundation of the osce following the 1990s paris charter has facilitated this process on a political level during the 1990s and 2000s from the later 20th century europe has come to be widely used as a synonym for the european union even though there are millions of people living on the european continent in non-eu member states the prefix pan implies that the identity applies throughout europe and especially in an eu context and pan-european is often contrasted with national identity european ethnic groups by sovereign state pan and pfeil 2002 distinguish 33 peoples which form the majority population in at least one sovereign state geographically situated in europe these majorities range from nearly homogeneous populations as in armenia and poland to comparatively slight majorities as in latvia or belgium or even the marginal majority in bosnia and herzegovina montenegro is a multiethnic state in which no group forms a majority see also aryan race european diaspora caucasoid
