a kite is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag a kite consists of wings tethers and anchors kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it some kite designs dont need a bridle box kites can have a single attachment point a kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite one technical definition is that a kite is a collection of tether-coupled wing sets the lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kites surface producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings the interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind the resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached the anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving eg the towing of a kite by a running person boat free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle the same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids so kites can be used in underwater currents but there are no everyday uses as yet man-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance entertainment and during development of the first practical aircraft the biplane kites have a long and varied history and many different types are flown individually and at festivals worldwide kites may be flown for recreation art or other practical uses sport kites can be flown in aerial ballet sometimes as part of a competition power kites are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which can be used to power activities such as kite surfing kite landboarding kite fishing kite buggying and snow kiting history kites were invented in asia though their exact origin can only be speculated many early sources point to china in china materials ideal for kite building were readily available including silk fabric for sail material fine high-tensile-strength silk for flying line and resilient bamboo for a strong lightweight framework the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century bc chinese philosophers mozi also mo di or mo ti and lu ban also gongshu ban or kungshu phan by 549 ad paper kites were certainly being flown as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission ancient and medieval chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances testing the wind lifting men signaling and communication for military operations the earliest known chinese kites were flat not bowed and often rectangular later tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying after its introduction into india the kite further evolved into the fighter kite known as the patang in india where thousands are flown every year on festivals such as makar sankranti kites were known throughout polynesia as far as new zealand with the assumption being that the knowledge diffused from china along with the people anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious ceremonies to send prayers to the gods polynesian kite traditions are used by anthropologists to get an idea of early primitive asian traditions that are believed to have at one time existed in asia kites were late to arrive in europe although windsock-like banners were known and used by the romans stories of kites were first brought to europe by marco polo towards the end of the 13th century and kites were brought back by sailors from japan and malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries konrad kyeser described dragon kites in bellifortis about 1400 ad although kites were initially regarded as mere curiosities by the 18th and 19th centuries they were being used as vehicles for scientific research in 1752 benjamin franklin published an account of a kite experiment to prove that lightning was caused by electricity kites were also instrumental in the research of the wright brothers and others as they developed the first airplane in the late 1800s several different designs of man-lifting kites were developed the period from 1860 to about 1910 became the golden age of kiting in the 20th century many new kite designs were developed these included eddys tailless diamond the tetrahedral kite the rogallo wing the sled kite the parafoil and power kites kites were used for scientific purposes especially in meteorology aeronautics wireless communications and photography the rogallo wing was adapted for stunt kites and hang gliding and the parafoil was adapted for parachuting and paragliding the rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites world war ii saw a limited use of kites for military purposes survival radio focke achgelis fa 330 military radio antenna kites kites are now mostly used for recreation lightweight synthetic materials ripstop nylon plastic film carbon fiber tube and rod are used for kite making synthetic rope and cord nylon polyethylene kevlar and dyneema are used as bridle and kite line materials designs often emulate flying insects birds and other beasts both real and mythical the finest chinese kites are made from split bamboo usually golden bamboo covered with silk and hand painted on larger kites clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed polyester rather than silk tails are used for some single-line kite designs to keep the kites nose pointing into the wind spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect there are rotating wind socks which spin like a turbine on large display kites these tails spinners and spinsocks can be 50 feet 15m long or more modern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kites angle to the wind traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency practical uses kites have been used for human flight military applications science and meteorology photography lifting radio antennas generating power aerodynamics experiments and much more military applications kites have been used for military purposes in the past such as signaling delivery of munitions and for observation both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using kite aerial photography kites were first used in warfare by the chinese during the song dynasty the fire crow a kite carrying incendiary powder a fuse and a burning stick of incense was developed as a weapon according to samguk sagi in 647 kim yu-sin a korean general of silla rallied his troops to defeat rebels by using flaming kites which also scared the enemy russian chronicles mention prince oleg of novgorod use of kites during the siege of constantinople in 906 and he crafted horses and men of paper armed and gilded and lifted them into the air over the city the greeks saw them and feared them walter de milemetes 1326 de nobilitatibus sapientiis et prudentiis regum treatise depicts a group of knights flying kite laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city kites were also used by admiral yi of the joseon dynasty 13921910 of korea during the japanese invasions of korea 15921598 admiral yi commanded his navy using kites his kites had specific markings directing his fleet to perform various orders in the modern era the british army used kites to haul human lookouts into the air for observation purposes using the kites developed by samuel franklin cody barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the second world war kites were also used for anti-aircraft target practice kites and kytoons were used for lofting communications antenna submarines lofted observers in rotary kites palestinians from the gaza strip have flown firebomb kites over the israelgaza barrier setting fires on the israeli side of the border hundreds of dunams of israeli crop fields were burned by firebomb kites launched from gaza with an estimated economic loss of several millions of shekels science and meteorology kites have been used for scientific purposes such as benjamin franklins famous experiment proving that lightning is electricity kites were the precursors to the traditional aircraft and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft alexander graham bell experimented with very large man-lifting kites as did the wright brothers and lawrence hargrave kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for weather forecasting francis ronalds and william radcliffe birt described a very stable kite at kew observatory as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height radio aerials and light beacons kites can be used for radio purposes by kites carrying antennas for mf lf or vlf-transmitters this method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by marconi captive balloons may be more convenient for such experiments because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor it must be taken into account during experiments that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground which can endanger people and equipment if suitable precautions grounding through resistors or a parallel resonant circuit tuned to transmission frequency are not taken kites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights kite traction kites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind efficient foil-type kites such as power kites can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels center boards wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft in the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular such as kite buggying kite landboarding kite boating and kite surfing snow kiting has also become popular in recent years kite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically there is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together underwater kites underwater kites are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water cultural uses kite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world they include large local events traditional festivals which have been held for hundreds of years and major international festivals which bring in kite flyers from other countries to display their unique art kites and demonstrate the latest technical kites many countries have kite museums these museums may have a focus on historical kites preserving the countrys kite traditions asia kite flying is popular in many asian countries where it often takes the form of kite fighting in which participants try to snag each others kites or cut other kites down fighter kites are usually small flat flattened diamond-shaped kites made of paper and bamboo tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised in afghanistan kite flying is a popular game and is known in dari as gudiparan bazi some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue which is legal the resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitors strings more easily the abrasive strings can also injure people during the taliban rule in afghanistan kite flying was banned among various other recreations in

flutes are attached allowing the wind to hum a musical tune there are other forms of sound-making kites in bali large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration and in malaysia row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies malaysia has also the kite museum in malacca kites are very popular in india with the states of gujarat bihar jharkhand west bengal rajasthan and punjab notable for their kite fighting festivals highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in

game whose goal is to maneuver their own kites to cut the other persons kites strings during flight and followed by kite running where participants race through the streets to take the free-drifting kites as in other countries with similar traditions injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions in chile kites are very popular especially during independence day festivities september 18 in peru kites are also very popular there are kite festival in parks and beache mostly on august in colombia kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during august which is known to be windy it is during this month that most people especially the young ones would fly kites in guyana kites are flown at easter an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate kites are generally not flown at any other time of year kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity it all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on easter monday especially in georgetown the capital and other coastal areas the history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that easter is a christian festival it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the risen lord moore describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows a very popular creole pastime was the flying of kites easter monday a public holiday was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in georgetown and on open lands in villages young and old alike male and female appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania easter 1885 serves as a good example the appearance of the sky all over georgetown but especially towards the sea wall was very striking the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes covered with gaily coloured paper all riding bravely on the strong wind the exact origins of the practice of kite flying exclusively at easter are unclear brereton and yelvington speculate that kite flying was introduced by chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of british guiana in the mid 19th century the author of an article in the guyana chronicle newspaper of may 6 2007 is more certain kite flying originated as a chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring however because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class read plantation workers the chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of jesus christ it was a clever argument as at that time christians celebrated easter to the glory of the risen christ the chinese came to guyana from 18531879 world records there are many world records involving kites the worlds largest kites are inflatable single-line kites the world record for the largest kite flown for at least 20 minutes is the flag of kuwait the single-kite altitude record is held by a triangular-box delta kite on 23 september 2014 a team led by robert moore flew a 129 square feet 12m kite to 16009 feet 4880m above ground level the record altitude was reached after 8 series of attempts over a ten-year period from a remote location in western nsw australia the 92 feet 3m tall and 196 feet 6m wide dunton-taylor delta kites flight was controlled by a winch system using 40682 feet 12400m of ultra high strength dyneema line the flight took about eight hours from ground and return the height was measured with on-board gps telemetry transmitting positional data in real time to a ground-based computer and also back-up gps data loggers for later analysis in popular culture the kite runner a 2005 novel by khaled hosseini

general safety issues there are safety issues involved in kite-flying kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects in urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft it
