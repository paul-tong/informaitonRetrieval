venera 9 russian -9 meaning venus 9 manufacturers designation 4v-1 no 660 was a soviet unmanned space mission to venus it consisted of an orbiter and a lander it was launched on june 8 1975 at 023800utc and had a mass of 4936 kilograms 10882lb the orbiter was the first spacecraft to orbit venus while the lander was the first to return images from the surface of another planet orbiter the orbiter entered venus orbit on october 20 1975 its mission was to act as a communications relay for the lander and to explore cloud layers and atmospheric parameters with several instruments and experiments it performed 17 survey missions from october 26 1975 to december 25 1975 the orbiter consisted of a cylinder with two solar panel wings and a high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface a bell-shaped unit holding propulsion systems was attached to the bottom of the cylinder and mounted on top was a 24-metre 79ft sphere which held the lander orbiter design the instruments comprising the orbiter included 16-28 m ir spectrometer 8-28 m ir radiometer 352nm uv photometer 2 photo-polarimeters 335-800nm 300-800nm spectrometer lyman- alpha hd spectrometer bistatic radar mapping cm dm radio occultations triaxial magnetometer 345-380nm uv camera 355-445nm camera 6 electrostatic analyzers 2 modulation ion traps low-energy proton alpha detector low-energy electron detector 3 semiconductor counters 2 gas-discharge counters cherenkov detector lander the lander was encased in a spherical shell before landing to help protect it from the heat of entry as it slowed from 107 kms to 150 ms this sphere was then separated with explosive bolts and a three-domed parachute was deployed which slowed the lander further to 50 ms at an altitude of 63 km above the planet the descent through the cloud layer took about 20 minutes during which time the lander took measurements of the atmosphere and radioed the information to the orbiter to minimize lander damage in the hot atmosphere the parachute was released at an altitude of 50 km and the ring-shaped aerodynamic shield provided braking the venusian atmosphere is so dense near the surface that this shield provided a descent rate of 7 ms as the lander touched down the landing device a hollow ring surrounding the lower part of the lander was partly crushed upon touchdown to take up most of the landing impact on october 20 1975 the lander spacecraft separated from the orbiter and landing was made with the sun near zenith at 0513utc on october 22 venera 9 landed within a 150km 93mi radius of 3101n 29138e 3101n 29164e 3101 29164 near beta regio on a steep 20 slope covered with boulders suspected to be the slope of the tectonic rift valley aikhylu chasma the entry sphere weighed 1560kg 3440lb and the surface payload was 660kg 1455lb it was the first spacecraft to return an image from the surface of another planet many of the instruments began working immediately after touchdown and the cameras were operational 2 minutes later these instruments revealed a smooth surface with numerous stones the lander measured a light level of 14000 lux similar to that of earth in full daylight but no direct sunshine a system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load this system plus pre-cooling prior to entry permitted operation of the lander for 53 minutes after landing at which time radio contact with the orbiter was lost as the orbiter moved out of radio range during descent heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells three parachutes a disc-shaped drag brake and a compressible metal doughnut-shaped landing cushion the landing was about 2200km 1400mi from the venera 10 landing site venera 9 measured clouds that were 3040km 1925mi thick with bases at 3035km 1922mi altitude it also measured atmospheric chemicals including hydrochloric acid hydrofluoric acid bromine and iodine other measurements included surface pressure of about 9100 kilopascals 90atm temperature of 485c 905f and surface light levels comparable to those at earth mid-latitudes on a cloudy summer day venera 9 was the first probe to send back black and white television pictures from the venusian surface showing no shadows no apparent dust in the air and a variety of 30 to 40cm 12 to 16in rocks which were not eroded planned 360-degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because one of two camera lens covers failed to come off limiting pictures to 180 degrees this failure recurred with venera 10 lander payload the lander payload was as follows temperature and pressure sensors accelerometer visible ir photometer - iov-75 backscatter and multi-angle nephelometers - mnv-75 p-11 mass spectrometer - mav-75 panoramic telephotometers 2 with lamps anemometer - isv-75 gamma-ray spectrometer - gs-12v gamma-ray densitometer - rp-75 see also spaceflight portal list of missions to venus timeline of artificial satellites and space probes
