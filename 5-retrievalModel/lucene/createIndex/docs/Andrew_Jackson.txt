andrew jackson march 15 1767 june 8 1845 was an american soldier and statesman who served as the seventh president of the united states from 1829 to 1837 before being elected to the presidency jackson gained fame as a general in the united states army and served in both houses of congress as president jackson sought to advance the rights of the common man against a corrupt aristocracy and to preserve the union born in the colonial carolinas to a scotch-irish family in the decade before the american revolutionary war jackson became a frontier lawyer and married rachel donelson robards he served briefly in the us house of representatives and the us senate representing tennessee after resigning he served as a justice on the tennessee supreme court from 1798 until 1804 jackson purchased a property later known as the hermitage and became a wealthy slaveowning planter in 1801 he was appointed colonel of the tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year he led troops during the creek war of 18131814 winning the battle of horseshoe bend the subsequent treaty of fort jackson required the creek surrender of vast lands in present-day alabama and georgia in the concurrent war against the british jacksons victory in 1815 at the battle of new orleans made him a national hero jackson then led us forces in the first seminole war which led to the annexation of florida from spain jackson briefly served as floridas first territorial governor before returning to the senate he ran for president in 1824 winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote as no candidate won an electoral majority the house of representatives elected john quincy adams in a contingent election in reaction to the alleged corrupt bargain between adams and henry clay and the ambitious agenda of president adams jacksons supporters founded the democratic party jackson ran again in 1828 defeating adams in a landslide jackson faced the threat of secession by south carolina over what opponents called the tariff of abominations the crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and jackson threatened the use of military force if south carolina attempted to secede in congress henry clay led the effort to reauthorize the second bank of the united states jackson regarding the bank as a corrupt institution vetoed the renewal of its charter after a lengthy struggle jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the bank in 1835 jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt fulfilling a longtime goal his presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party spoils system in american politics in 1830 jackson signed the indian removal act which forcibly relocated most members of the native american tribes in the south to indian territory in foreign affairs jacksons administration concluded a most favored nation treaty with great britain settled claims of damages against france from the napoleonic wars and recognized the republic of texas in january 1835 he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president in his retirement jackson remained active in democratic party politics supporting the presidencies of martin van buren and james k polk though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate jackson advocated the annexation of texas which was accomplished shortly before his death jackson has been widely revered in the united states as an advocate for democracy and the common man many of his actions such as those during the bank war proved divisive garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country his reputation has suffered since the 1970s largely due to his role in indian removal surveys of historians and scholars have ranked jackson favorably among united states presidents early life and education andrew jackson was born on march 15 1767 in the waxhaws region of the carolinas his parents were scots-irish colonists andrew and elizabeth hutchinson jackson presbyterians who had emigrated from present day northern ireland two years earlier jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim in current-day northern ireland around 1738 jacksons parents lived in the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in 1765 jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scots-irish community in the waxhaws straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born 1763 and robert born 1764 jacksons father died in a logging accident while clearing land in february 1767 at the age of 29 three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mothers actions immediately following her husbands funeral the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in 1824 jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle james crawford in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of 1824 which he opposed in the mid-1850s second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina as a young boy jackson was easily offended and was considered something of a bully he was however said to have taken a group of younger and weaker boys under his wing and been very kind to them revolutionary war service during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june 20 1779 anti-british sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may 29 1780 jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august 6 andrew and robert were captured by the british in 1781 while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity later that year their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release she then began to walk both boys back to their home in the waxhaws a distance of some 40 miles 64km both were in very poor health robert who was far worse rode on the only horse that they had while andrew walked behind them in the final two hours of the journey a torrential downpour began which worsened the effects of the smallpox within two days of arriving back home robert was dead and andrew in mortal danger after nursing andrew back to health elizabeth volunteered to nurse american prisoners of war on board two british ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age 14 he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother early career legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people in 1781 he worked for a time as a saddle-maker and eventually taught school he apparently prospered in neither profession in 1784 he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september 1787 jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped him get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in 1788 having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to the small frontier town of nashville in 1788 where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in 1790 according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce her divorce had not been made final making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in 1794 to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and early public career in 1794 jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer john overton dealing in claims for land reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw like many of their contemporaries they dealt in such claims although the land was in indian country most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of 1783 that briefly opened indian lands west of the appalachians within north carolina to claim by that states residents he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in 1819 after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the territory jackson became attorney general in 1791 and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in 1796 when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its only us representative he was a member of the democratic-republican party the dominant party in tennessee jackson soon became associated with the more radical pro-french and anti-british wing he strongly opposed the jay treaty and criticized george washington for allegedly removing republicans from public office jackson joined several other republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for washington a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency in 1797 the state legislature elected him as us senator jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying he pronounced himself disgusted with the administration of president john adams and resigned the following year without explanation upon returning home with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of 600 jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804 his official reason for resigning was ill health he had been suffering financially from poor land ventures and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia in 1802 while serving on the tennessee supreme court he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers at that time most free men were members of the militia the organizations intended to be called up in case of conflict with europeans or indians resembled large social clubs jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature with strong support from western tennessee he tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february 5 governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence of land fraud against sevier subsequently in 1803 when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier insulted jackson in public and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until 1809 planting career and controversy in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in 1803 the next year he acquired the hermitage a 640-acre 259ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added 360 acres 146ha to the plantation which eventually totaled 1050 acres 425ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slavesjackson began with nine owned as many as 44 by 1820 and later up to 150 placing him among the planter elite jackson also co-owned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed 51 slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in 400 square feet 37m cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation in one advertisement placed in the tennessee gazette in october 1804 jackson offered ten dollars extra for every hundred lashes any person will give him to the amount of three hundred the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may 1806 charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men in tennessee who called it a brutal cold-blooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in 1805 his political career over after the killing of alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 went on a tour of what was then the western united states burr was extremely well received by the people of tennessee and stayed for five days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards spain due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements and by spains disinterest in returning fugitive slaves on october 4 1806 jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas at that time there was an east florida and a west florida but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should there be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short noticethat number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprisei think could look into santafee and maxicogive freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interiorwhich will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november 10 he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to public officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf in trial the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in 1808 against james madison the latter was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democratic-republican party jackson lived relatively quietly at the hermitage in the years after the burr trial eventually accumulating 640 acres of land military career war of 1812 creek campaign and treaty leading up to 1812 the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased for a number of reasons among these was the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june 18 1812 congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of 1812 jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering 2500 volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support of burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january 10 1813 jackson led an army of 2071 volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he had been instructed to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez then part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february 6 ordering him to dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march 15 jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies he also promised instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in natchez to march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson became known as old hickory the army arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him respect and praise from the people of tennessee jackson faced financial ruin until his former aide-de-camp thomas benton persuaded secretary armstrong to order the army to pay the expenses jackson had incurred on june 14 jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton the brother of thomas in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in a street brawl with the benton brothers jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder on august 30 a group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the red sticks so named for the color of their war paint perpetrated the fort mims massacre during the massacre hundreds of white american settlers and non-red stick creeks were slaughtered the red sticks led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy which wanted peace with the united states they were allied with tecumseh a shawnee chief who had launched tecumsehs war against the united states and who was fighting alongside the british the resulting conflict became known as the creek war jackson with 2500 men was ordered to crush the hostile indians on october 10 he set out on the expedition his arm still in a sling from fighting the bentons jackson established fort strother as a supply base on november 3 coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega in the winter jackson encamped at fort strother faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions he sent coffee with the cavalry which abandoned him back to tennessee to secure more enlistments jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia and marched to meet the georgia troops from january 2224 1814 while on their way the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over 2000 troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river on march 27 enjoying an advantage of more than 2 to 1 he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june 8 jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and 10 days later became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender 23 million acres 8093713 ha of land to the united states most of the creeks bitterly acquiesced though in ill-health from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which had caused them to seek british protection in the november 7 battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in mobile alabama to guard against a possible invasion there and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city the creeks coined their own name for jackson jacksa chula harjo or jackson old and fierce battle of new orleans after arriving in new orleans on december 1 1814 jackson instituted martial law in the city as he worried about the loyalty of the citys creole and spanish inhabitants at the same time he formed an alliance with jean lafittes smugglers and formed military units consisting of african-americans and muscogees in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary these forces along with us army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states joined with jacksons force in defending new orleans the approaching british force led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham consisted of over 10000 soldiers many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars jackson only had about 5000 men most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december 23 that evening jackson attacked the british and temporarily drove them back on january 8 1815 the british launched a major frontal assault against jacksons defenses an initial artillery barrage by the british did little damage to the well-constructed american defenses once the morning fog had cleared the british launched a frontal assault and their troops made easy targets for the americans protected by their parapets despite managing to temporarily drive back the american right flank the overall attack ended in disaster for the battle on january 8 jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties of these 13 men were killed 39 wounded and 19 missing or captured the british admitted 2037 casualties of these 291 men were killed including pakenham 1262 wounded and 484 missing or captured after the battle the british retreated from the area and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the treaty of ghent had been signed in europe that december coming in the waning days of the war jacksons victory made him a national hero as the country celebrated the end of what many called the second american revolution against the british by a congressional resolution on february 27 1815 jackson was given the thanks of congress and awarded a congressional gold medal alexis de tocqueville underwhelmed by jackson according to a 2001 commentator later wrote in democracy in america that jackson was raised to the presidency and has been maintained there solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under the walls of new orleans some have claimed that because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the treaty of ghent jacksons victory at new orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure however the spanish who had sold the louisiana territory to france disputed frances right to sell it to the united states through the louisiana purchase in 1803 had the british defeated jackson at new orleans they might have held on to the territory or returned it to spain furthermore article ix of the treaty of ghent stipulated that the united states must return land taken from the creeks to their original owners essentially undoing the treaty of fort jackson thanks to jacksons victory at new orleans the american government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that jackson had acquired enforced martial law in new orleans jackson still not knowing for certain of the treatys signing refused to lift martial law in the city in march 1815 after us district court judge dominic a hall signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a louisiana legislator whom jackson had detained jackson ordered halls arrest state senator louis louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the new orleans newspaper challenging jacksons refusal to release the militia after the british ceded the field of battle he too was put in jail jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a louisiana legislator a federal judge and a lawyer and after the intervention of state judge joshua lewis lewis was simultaneously serving under jackson in the militia and also had signed a writ of habeas corpus against jackson his commanding officer seeking judge halls release civilian authorities in new orleans had reason to fear jacksonhe summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave their deaths were not well publicized until the coffin handbills were circulated during his 1828 presidential campaign first seminole war following the war jackson remained in command of troops on the southern border of the us he conducted business from the hermitage he signed treaties with the cherokee and chickasaw which gained for the united states large parts of tennessee and kentucky the treaty with the chickasaw finally agreed to later in the year is commonly known as the jackson purchase several native american tribes which became known as the seminole straddled the border between the us and florida the seminole in alliance with escaped slaves frequently raided georgia settlements before retreating back into florida these skirmishes continually escalated and the conflict is now known as the first seminole war in 1816 jackson led a detachment into florida which destroyed the negro fort a community of escaped slaves and their descendants jackson was ordered by president monroe in december 1817 to lead a campaign in georgia against the seminole and creek indians jackson was also charged with preventing florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions his orders from president monroe were to terminate the conflict jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all before departing jackson wrote to monroe let it be signified to me through any channel that the possession of the floridas would be desirable to the united states and in sixty days it will be accomplished jackson invaded florida on march 15 1818 capturing pensacola he crushed seminole and spanish resistance in the region and captured two british agents robert ambrister and alexander arbuthnot who had been working with the seminole after a brief trial jackson executed both of the men causing a diplomatic incident with the british jacksons actions polarized monroes cabinet some of whom argued that jackson had gone against monroes orders and violated the constitution since the united states had not declared war upon spain he was defended by secretary of state john quincy adams adams thought that jacksons conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adamsons treaty of 1819 a congressional investigation exonerated jackson but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received particularly from speaker of the house henry clay after the ratification of the adamsons treaty in 1821 jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial governor of florida before returning to tennessee presidential aspirations election of 1824 in the spring of 1822 jackson suffered a physical breakdown his body had two bullets lodged in it and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning he regularly coughed up blood and his entire body shook jackson feared that he was on the brink of death after several months of rest he recovered during his convalescence jacksons thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs he obsessed over rampant corruption in the monroe administration and grew to detest the second bank of the united states blaming it for causing the panic of 1819 by contracting credit jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state but accepted john overtons plan to have the legislature nominate him for president on july 22 1822 he was officially nominated by the tennessee legislature jackson had come to dislike secretary of the treasury william h crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroes cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford yet jacksons nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford adams clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democratic-republican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions at the forefront of jacksons campaign was combatting corruption jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses in 1823 jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats the move was independently orchestrated by his advisors william berkeley lewis and us senator john eaton in order to defeat incumbent john williams who openly opposed his presidential candidacy the legislature narrowly elected him his return after 24 years 11 months 3 days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history although jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the senate he was appointed chairman of the committee on military affairs eaton wrote to rachel that jackson as a senator was in harmony and good understanding with every body including thomas hart benton now a senator from missouri with whom jackson had fought in 1813 meanwhile jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency as was customary eaton updated an already-written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and along with others wrote letters to newspapers praising jacksons record and past conduct democratic-republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in 1824 most of the democratic-republicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people in the vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-atlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking 42 percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won 99 electoral votes more than any other candidate but still short of 131 which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency clay who as speaker of the house presided over the election saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federally funded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the first ballot furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached a corrupt bargain after adams appointed clay as his secretary of state so you see jackson growled the judas of the west has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver his end will be the same after the election jackson resigned his senate seat and returned to tennessee election of 1828 and death of rachel jackson almost immediately opposition arose to the adams presidency jackson opposed adamss plan to involve the us in panamas quest for independence writing the moment we engage in confederations or alliances with any nation we may from that time date the down fall of our republic adams damaged his standing in his first annual message to congress when he argued that congress must not give the world the impression that we are palsied by the will of our constituents jackson was nominated for president by the tennessee legislature in october 1825 more than three years before the 1828 election it was the earliest such nomination in presidential history and it attested to the fact that jacksons supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended adamss presidency floundered as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics critics led by jackson attacked adamss policies as a dangerous expansion of federal power new york senator martin van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in 1824 emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828 van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who opposed much of adamss agenda on states rights grounds van buren and other jackson allies established numerous pro-jackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the one-party era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans in the large scots-irish community that was especially numerous in the rural south and southwest jackson was a favorite the campaign was heavily personal as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was labelled a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with jackson jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for emperor alexander i they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and often struggled while jackson was away she began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season jackson described her symptoms as excruciating pain in the left shoulder arm and breast after struggling for three days rachel finally died of a heart attack on december 22 1828 three weeks after her husbands victory in the election which began on october 31 and ended on december 2 and 10 weeks before jackson took office as president a distraught jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body he felt that the abuse from adamss supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him rachel was buried at the hermitage on christmas eve may god almighty forgive her murderers jackson swore at her funeral i never can presidency 18291837 philosophy jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary generation jackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed in the ability of the people to arrive at right conclusions they had the right not only to elect but to instruct their agents representatives office holders should either obey the popular will or resign he rejected the view of a powerful and independent supreme court with binding decisions arguing that the congress the executive and the court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the constitution jackson thought that supreme court justices should be made to stand for election and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to insure democratic rule he called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the electoral college jackson was far ahead of his timesand maybe even further than this country can ever achieve inauguration jackson departed from the hermitage on january 19 and arrived in washington on february 11 he then set about choosing his cabinet members jackson chose van buren as expected for secretary of state eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip jackson blamed adams in part for what was said about rachel during the campaign and refused to meet him after arriving in washington therefore adams chose not to attend the inauguration on march 4 1829 andrew jackson became the first united states president-elect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkablebut jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by in attempting to drive the eatons out daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of 1831 jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in 1832 jackson nominated van buren to be minister to great britain calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it claiming the defeated nomination would kill van buren sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick van buren continued to serve as an important adviser to jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the 1832 election making him jacksons heir-apparent the petticoat affair led to the development of the kitchen cabinet the kitchen cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president its existence was partially rooted in jacksons difficulties with his official cabinet even after the purging indian removal policy throughout his eight years in office jackson made about 70 treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indian-anglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency in his first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may 26 1830 congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law effectively relinquishing their sovereignty jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832 and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in 1832 refused to move in december 1835 this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in 1842 members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in 1832 allowing the creek to either sell or retain their land conflict later erupted between the creek who remained and the white settlers leading to a second creek war a common complaint amongst the tribes was that the men who had signed the treaties did not represent the whole tribe the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the 1832 supreme court decision in worcester v georgia chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries the court also did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the cherokee largely considered themselves independent and not subject to the laws of the united states or georgia the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor van buren subsequently as many as 4000 out of 18000 cherokees died on the trail of tears in 1838 more than 45000 american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in 1832 after a group of indians crossed into us territory reforms rotation of offices and spoils system in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster general barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts as well as failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the post office department jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vice-president to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress although he was unable to implement these goals jacksons time in office did see a variety of other reforms he supported an act in july 1836 that enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in 1836 jackson established the ten-hour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed by president monroe in 1820 that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was a democratic reform preventing hereditary officeholding and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about 20 of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson nonetheless used his presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington sometimes forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult remini claims that because friendship politics and geography constituted the presidents total criteria for appointments most of his appointments were predictably substandard nullification crisis in 1828 congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the south now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton the issue came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of 1828 secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullifydeclare voidthe tariff legislation of 1828 although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident came at the april 13 1830 jefferson day dinner involving after-dinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may 1830 jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in 1818 while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february 1831 the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green initially supported jackson after it sided with calhoun on nullification jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november 1830 established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the primary mouthpiece of the democratic party jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the tariff of 1832 it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates written by treasury secretary louis mclane the bill lowered duties from 45 to 27 in may representative john quincy adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill which jackson accepted it passed congress on july 9 and was signed by the president on july 14 the bill ultimately failed to satisfy extremists on either side on november 24 the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of 1832 and the tariff of 1828 in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december 28 1832 calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina this was part of a strategy whereby calhoun with less than three months remaining on his vice presidential term would replace robert y hayne in the senate who would then become governor hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the senate especially against fierce criticism from senator daniel webster of massachusetts in december 1832 jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution forms a government not a league to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states are not a nation jackson tended to personalize the controversy frequently characterizing nullification as a conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff it was introduced by senator felix grundy of tennessee and was quickly attacked by calhoun as military despotism at the same time calhoun and clay began to work on a new compromise tariff a bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by representative gulian c verplanck of new york but it lowered rates more sharply than clay and other protectionists desired clay managed to get calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for clays opposition to jacksons military threats and perhaps with the hope that he could win some southern votes in his next bid for the presidency the compromise tariff passed on march 1 1833 the force bill passed the same day calhoun clay and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition with the only dissenting vote coming from john tyler of virginia the new tariff was opposed by webster who argued that it essentially surrendered to south carolinas demands jackson despite his anger over the scrapping of the verplanck bill and the new alliance between clay and calhoun saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis he signed both bills on march 2 starting with the force bill the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may 1 jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july 4 1831 that would award the us 25000000 5000000 in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december 1834 state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for non-payment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until jackson had apologized for his remarks in his december 1835 state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february 1836 reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased 75 while imports increased 250 jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for 5000000 failed the charg daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in 1835 the texas revolution began when pro-slavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may 1836 they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states jackson was hesitant in recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating alce louis la branche as charg daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march 3 1837 jackson failed in his efforts to open trade with china and japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of 1832 the 1832 presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december 1831 nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the anti-masonic party emerged by capitalizing on opposition to freemasonry which existed primarily in new england after the disappearance and possible murder of william morgan the party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september 1831 nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania clay was like jackson a mason and so some anti-jacksonians who would have supported the national republican party supported wirt instead in 1816 the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of 1812 monroe had appointed nicholas biddle as the banks executive jackson believed that the bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly its stock was mostly held by foreigners he insisted and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful he accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections in his address to congress in 1830 jackson called for a substitute for the bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land its only power would be to issue bills of exchange the address touched off fiery debate in the senate thomas hart benton now a strong supporter of the president despite the brawl years earlier gave a speech strongly denouncing the bank and calling for open debate on its recharter webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution shortly afterward the globe announced that jackson would stand for reelection despite his misgivings about the bank he supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-bank treasury secretary louis mclane who was secretly working with biddle to recharter a reformed version of the bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nations debt this would be done in part through the sale of government stock in the bank over the objections of attorney general roger b taney an irreconcilable opponent of the bank jackson allowed mclane to publish a treasury report which essentially recommended rechartering the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill he and webster urged biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate democrats such as mclane and william lewis who argued that biddle should wait because jackson would likely veto the recharter bill on january 6 1832 biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter without any of the proposed reforms the submission came four years before the original 20-year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june 11 and the house on july 3 1832 jackson determined to veto it many moderate democrats including mclane were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision when van buren met jackson on july 4 jackson declared the bank mr van buren is trying to kill me but i will kill it jackson officially vetoed the bill on july 10 the veto message was crafted primarily by taney kendall and jacksons nephew and advisor andrew jackson donelson it attacked the bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy the veto was considered one of the strongest and most controversial presidential statements and a brilliant political manifesto the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man at biddles direction the bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat jackson seemingly confirming jacksons view that it interfered in the political process on july 21 clay said privately the campaign is over and i think we have won the victory jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match for jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election by a landslide receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the anti-masonic party eventually declined jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in 1833 jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed mclane from the treasury department having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits signalling his intent to continue battling the bank he replaced duane with taney under taney the deposits began to be removed they were placed in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administrations policies known to critics as pet banks biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic the moves were intended to force jackson into a compromise nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in congress he wrote at first biddles strategy was successful putting enormous pressure on jackson but jackson handled the situation well when people came to him complaining he referred them to biddle saying that he was the man who had all the money jacksons approach worked biddles strategy backfired increasing anti-bank sentiment in 1834 those who disagreed with jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed seventeenth century british monarchy a movement emerged among whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march 28 the senate voted to censure jackson 2620 it also rejected taney as treasury secretary the house however led by ways and means committee chairman james k polk declared on april 4 that the bank ought not to be rechartered and that the depositions ought not to be restored it voted to continue allowing pet banks to be places of deposit and voted even more overwhelmingly to investigate whether the bank had deliberately instigated the panic jackson called the passage of these resolutions a glorious triumph it essentially sealed the banks demise the democrats later suffered a temporary setback polk ran for speaker of the house to replace andrew stevenson after southerners discovered his connection to van buren he was defeated by fellow-tennessean john bell a democrat-turned-whig who opposed jacksons removal policy payment of us national debt the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills on january 1 1835 jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished the objective had been reached in part through jacksons reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his vetoes of legislation had he deemed extravagant in december 1835 polk defeated bell in a rematch and was elected speaker finally on january 16 1837 when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led ironically by benton in 1836 in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes contributing to the panic of 1837 the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in 1836 had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may 6 1833 jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january 30 1835 what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davycrockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence offered a variety of explanations for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed english kingspecifically richard iii dead since 1485and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that also protected their young nation the incident became a part of jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life his suspicions were never proven anti-slavery tracts during the summer of 1835 northern abolitionists began sending anti-slavery tracts through the postal system into the south pro-slavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary and some began to riot jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the 1836 election he fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts that december jackson called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in 1828 but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed adams expedition plans eventually wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may 18 1836 jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of the navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838 during the presidency of van buren one brig ship ussporpoise later used in the expedition having been commissioned by secretary dickerson in may 1836 circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of 1837 in spite of economic success following jacksons vetoes and war against the bank reckless speculation in land and railroads eventually caused the panic of 1837 contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the panic of 1837 the specie circular which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound administration and cabinet judicial appointments jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court most were undistinguished his first appointee john mclean had been nominated in barrys place after barry had agreed to become postmaster general mclean turned whig and forever schemed to win the presidency his next two appointeeshenry baldwin and james moore waynedisagreed with jackson on some points but were poorly regarded even by jacksons enemies in reward for his services jackson nominated taney to the court to fill a vacancy in january 1835 but the nomination failed to win senate approval chief justice marshall died in 1835 leaving two vacancies on the court jackson nominated taney for chief justice and philip pendleton barbour for associate justice both were confirmed by the new senate taney served as chief justice until 1864 presiding over a court that upheld many of the precedents set by the marshall court he was generally regarded as a good and respectable judge but his opinion in dred scott v sandford largely overshadows his career on the last full day of his presidency jackson nominated john catron who was confirmed states admitted to the union two new states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june 15 1836 and michigan january 26 1837 both states increased democratic power in congress and helped van buren win the presidency in 1836 this was in keeping with the tradition that new states would support the party which had done the most to admit them later life and death in 1837 after serving two terms as president jackson was replaced by his chosen successor martin van buren and retired to the hermitage he immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jackson jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of 1837 he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until 1840 during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the 1840 presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats when jackson ran they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of polk for vice president at the 1840 democratic national convention over controversial incumbent richard mentor johnson no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to threaten the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially prior to the 1844 election jackson again supported van buren for president and polk for vice president a treaty of annexation was signed by tyler on april 12 1844 and submitted to the senate when a letter from secretary of state calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public anti-annexation sentiment exploded in the north and the bill failed to be ratified van buren decided to write the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south the whig nominee henry clay also opposed annexation and jackson recognized the need for the democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the south if the plan failed jackson warned texas would not join the union and would potentially fall victim to a mexican invasion supported by the british jackson met with polk robert armstrong and andrew jackson donelson in his study he then pointed directly at a startled polk telling him that as a man from the southwest and a supporter of annexation he would be the perfect candidate polk called the scheme utterly abortive but agreed to go along with it at the 1844 democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for re-election as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president polk won the election defeating clay a bill of annexation was passed by congress in february and signed by tyler on march 1 jackson died at his plantation on june 8 1845 at the age of 78 of chronic dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed but he subsequently revived gen jackson died at the hermitage at 6oclock pm on sunday the 8th instant when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july 1 1828 at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in 1804 andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in 1856 ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became co-hostess of the white house in 1834 it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in 1836 jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his blood-curdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his recordin duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearingslisteners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of his presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun on his deathbed he was once again quoted as regretting that he had not hanged calhoun for treason my country would have sustained me in the act and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come he said remini expresses the opinion that jackson was typically in control of his temper and that he used his anger along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at 6feet 1inch 185m tall and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds 59 and 64kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61 he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in 1838 jackson became an official member of the first presbyterian church in nashville both his mother and his wife had been devout presbyterians all their lives but jackson himself had postponed officially entering the church in order to avoid accusations that he was joining only for political reasons jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no 1 in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in 1945 his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy historical reputation jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage there has never been universal agreement on jacksons legacy for his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies and his friends almost his worshippers he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies he has been lauded as the champion of the common man while criticized for his treatment of indians and for other matters james parton was the first man after jacksons death to write a full biography of him trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject he wrote andrew jackson i am given to understand was a patriot and a traitor he was one of the greatest generals and wholly ignorant of the art of war a brilliant writer elegant eloquent without being able to compose a correct sentence or spell words of four syllables the first of statesmen he never devised he never framed a measure he was the most candid of men and was capable of the most profound dissimulation a most law-defying law-obeying citizen a stickler for discipline he never hesitated to disobey his superior a democratic autocrat an urbane savage an atrocious saint jackson was criticized by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demandssay rather anticipates and forestalls them general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly in the 20th century jackson was written about by many admirers arthur m schlesinger jrs age of jackson 1945 depicts jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper-class tyranny from the 1970s to the 1980s robert remini published a three-volume biography of jackson followed by an abridged one-volume study remini paints a generally favorable portrait of jackson he contends that jacksonian democracy stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable as such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american historypopulism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society to remini jackson serves as the embodiment of the new american this new man was no longer british he no longer wore the queue and silk pants he wore trousers and he had stopped speaking with a british accent other 20th-century writers such as richard hofstadter and bray hammond depict jackson as an advocate of the sort of laissez-faire capitalism that benefits the rich and oppresses the poor jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting mainly around 1970 jackson came under attack from some historians on this issue howard zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians conversely in 1969 francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the extremely hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini claims that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribes-namely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jeffersonjackson day fundraising dinners held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders because both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as because of jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners brands argues that jacksons reputation suffered since the 1960s as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention he also claims that the indian controversy overshadowed jacksons other achievements noting shifting attitudes on different national issues brands notes that he was often hailed during his lifetime as the second george washington because while washington had fought for independence jackson confirmed it at new orleans and made the united states a great power over time while the revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience memory of the war of 1812 including the battle of new orleans has sharply declined brands argues that this is because once america had become a military power it was easy to think that america had been destined for this role from the beginning still jacksons performance in office has generally been ranked in the top half in public opinion polling his position in c-spans poll dropped from 13th in 2009 to 18th in 2017 portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as 1869 and extending into the 21st century his image has appeared on the 5 10 20 and 10000 note most recently his image has appeared on the us 20 federal reserve note beginning in 1928 in 2016 treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by 2020 an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the 20 banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on several postage stamps he first appeared on an 1863 two-cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a 2-cent red stamp and the other a 2-cent green stamp both issued in 1863 memorials numerous counties and cities are named after him including the city of jacksonville in florida and north carolina the cities of jackson in louisiana michigan mississippi missouri and tennessee jackson county in florida illinois michigan mississippi missouri ohio and oregon and jackson parish in louisiana memorials to jackson include a set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor clark mills in lafayette square washington dc in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues
