international migration and the long-debated comprehensive convention on terrorism annan recommended streamlining the general assemblys agenda committee structure and procedures strengthening the role and authority of its president enhancing the role of civil society and establishing a mechanism to review the decisions of its committees in order to minimize unfunded mandates and micromanagement of

the united nations as well as the advisory role of the assembly in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law the summit also called for strengthening the relationship
