the rings of uranus are a system of rings around the planet uranus intermediate in complexity between the more extensive set around saturn and the simpler systems around jupiter and neptune the rings of uranus were discovered on march 10 1977 by james l elliot edward w dunham and jessica mink william herschel had also reported observing rings in 1789 modern astronomers are divided on whether he could have seen them as they are very dark and faint by 1978 nine distinct rings were identified two additional rings were discovered in 1986 in images taken by the voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings were found in 20032005 in hubble space telescope photos in the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986u2r 6 5 4 and their radii range from about 38000km for the 1986u2r ring to about 98000km for the ring additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings the rings are extremely darkthe bond albedo of the rings particles does not exceed 2 they are probably composed of water ice with the addition of some dark radiation-processed organics the majority of uranuss rings are opaque and only a few kilometers wide the ring system contains little dust overall it consists mostly of large bodies 0220m in diameter some rings are optically thin the broad and faint 1986u2r and rings are made of small dust particles while the narrow and faint ring also contains larger bodies the relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended uranian exosphere the rings of uranus are thought to be relatively young and not more than 600million years old the uranian ring system probably originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around the planet after colliding the moons probably broke up into many particles which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability the mechanism that confines the narrow rings is not well understood initially it was assumed that every narrow ring had a pair of nearby shepherd moons corralling them into shape in 1986 voyager 2 discovered only one such shepherd pair cordelia and ophelia around the brightest ring discovery the first mention of a uranian ring system comes from william herschels notes detailing his observations of uranus in the 18th century which include the following passage february 22 1789 a ring was suspected herschel drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was a little inclined to the red the keck telescope in hawaii has since confirmed this to be the case at least for the ring herschels notes were published in a royal society journal in 1797 in the two centuries between 1797 and 1977 the rings are rarely mentioned if at all this casts serious doubt on whether herschel could have seen anything of the sort while hundreds of other astronomers saw nothing it has been claimed that herschel gave accurate descriptions of the rings size relative to uranus its changes as uranus travelled around the sun and its color the definitive discovery of the uranian rings was made by astronomers james l elliot edward w dunham and jessica mink on march 10 1977 using the kuiper airborne observatory and was serendipitous they planned to use the occultation of the star sao 158687 by uranus to study the planets atmosphere when their observations were analyzed they found that the star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by the planet they deduced that a system of narrow rings was present the five occultation events they observed were denoted by the greek letters and in their papers these designations have been used as the rings names since then later they found four additional rings one between the and rings and three inside the ring the former was named the ring the latter were dubbed rings 4 5 and 6according to the numbering of the occultation events in one paper uranuss ring system was the second to be discovered in the solar system after that of saturn the rings were directly imaged when the voyager 2 spacecraft flew through the uranian system in 1986 two more faint rings were revealed bringing the total to eleven the hubble space telescope detected an additional pair of previously unseen rings in 20032005 bringing the total number known to 13 the discovery of these outer rings doubled the known radius of the ring system hubble also imaged two small satellites for the first time one of which mab shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring general properties as currently understood the ring system of uranus comprises thirteen distinct rings in order of increasing distance from the planet they are 1986u2r 6 5 4 rings they can be divided into three groups nine narrow main rings 6 5 4 two dusty rings 1986u2r and two outer rings the rings of uranus consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust although dust is known to be present in 1986u2r and rings in addition to these well-known rings there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them these faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs which are sometimes detected during occultations some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007 a number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering geometry by voyager 2 all rings of uranus show azimuthal brightness variations the rings are made of an extremely dark material the geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 56 while the bond albedo is even lowerabout 2 the rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surgean increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero this means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition the rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared they exhibit no identifiable spectral features the chemical composition of the ring particles is not known they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of saturn because they are too dark darker than the inner moons of uranus this indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material the nature of this material is not clear but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the uranian magnetosphere the rings particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons as a whole the ring system of uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of jupiter or the broad and complex rings of saturn some of which are composed of very bright materialwater ice there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system the saturnian f ring and the uranian ring are both narrow relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons the newly discovered outer and rings of uranus are similar to the outer g and e rings of saturn narrow ringlets existing in the broad saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of uranus in addition dust bands observed between the main rings of uranus may be similar to the rings of jupiter in contrast the neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of uranus although it is less complex darker and contains more dust the neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet narrow main rings ring the ring is the brightest and densest part of the uranian ring system and is responsible for about two-thirds of the light reflected by the rings while it is the most eccentric of the uranian rings it has negligible orbital inclination the rings eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit the radially integrated brightness of the ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near periapsis the maximumminimum brightness ratio is about 2530 these variations are connected with the variations of the ring width which is 197km at the periapsis and 964km at the apoapsis as the ring becomes wider the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view leading to higher integrated brightness the width variations were measured directly from voyager 2 images as the ring was one of only two rings resolved by voyagers cameras such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin indeed occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 05 and 25 being highest near the periapsis the equivalent depth of the ring is around 47km and is invariant around the orbit the geometric thickness of the ring is not precisely known although the ring is certainly very thinby some estimates as thin as 150m despite such infinitesimal thickness it consists of several layers of particles the ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0008 to 006 the mean size of the ring particles is 02200m and the mean separation is around 45 times their radius the ring is almost devoid of dust possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from uranuss extended atmospheric corona due to its razor-thin nature the ring is invisible when viewed edge-on this happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed the voyager 2 spacecraft observed a strange signal from the ring during the radio occultation experiment the signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 36cm near rings apoapsis such strong scattering requires the existence of a coherent structure that the ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations the ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets some of which may have incomplete arcs the ring is known to have interior and exterior shepherd moonscordelia and ophelia respectively the inner edge of the ring is in 2425 resonance with cordelia and the outer edge is in 1413 resonance with ophelia the masses of the moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively the mass of the ring is estimated to be about 10kg ring the ring is circular and slightly inclined it shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width one possible explanation is that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure excited by a small moonlet just inside it the sharp outer edge of the ring is in 2322 resonance with cordelia the ring consists of two components a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth the width of the narrow component is 4161km and the equivalent depth is about 22km which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0306 the rings broad component is about 1012km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 03km indicating a low normal optical depth of 310 this is known only from occultation data because voyager 2s imaging experiment failed to resolve the ring when observed in forward-scattering geometry by voyager 2 the ring appeared relatively bright which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component the broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component this is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when the ring remained visible which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring ring the ring is narrow optically dense and slightly eccentric its orbital inclination is almost zero the width of the ring varies in the range 3647km although equivalent optical depth is constant at 33km the normal optical depth of the ring is 0709 during a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the ring disappeared which means it is geometrically thin like the ring and devoid of dust the width and normal optical depth of the ring show significant azimuthal variations the mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known but it has been noticed that the sharp inner edge of the ring is in a 65 resonance with ophelia ring the ring has zero orbital eccentricity and inclination like the ring it consists of two components a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth the width of the narrow component is 1927km and the equivalent depth is about 042km which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 016025 the broad component is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 085km indicating a low normal optical depth of 210 it was resolved in voyager 2 images in forward-scattered light the ring looked bright which indicated the presence of a considerable amount of dust in this ring probably in the broad component the broad component is much thicker geometrically than the narrow one this conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when the ring demonstrated increased brightness becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system this is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring like the majority of other rings the ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width the narrow component even vanishes in some places and rings after the ring the and rings are the brightest of uranuss rings like the ring they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width they are brightest and widest 30 from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30 from the periapsis the and rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination the widths of these rings are 4810km and 61114km respectively the equivalent optical depths are 329km and 214km resulting in normal optical depths of 0307 and 02035 respectively during a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared which means they are geometrically thin like the ring and devoid of dust the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the ring which was also observed earlier by voyager 2 the masses of the and rings are estimated to be about 510kg eachhalf the mass of the ring rings 6 5 and 4 rings 6 5 and 4 are the innermost and dimmest of uranuss narrow rings they are the most inclined rings and their orbital eccentricities are the largest excluding the ring in fact their inclinations 006 005 and 003 were large enough for voyager 2 to observe their elevations above the uranian equatorial plane which were 2446km rings 6 5 and 4 are also the narrowest rings of uranus measuring 1622km 1949km and 2444km wide respectively their equivalent depths are 041km 091 and 071km resulting in normal optical depth 018025 018048 and 01603 they were not visible during a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 due to their narrowness and lack of dust dusty rings ring the ring was one of two rings discovered by voyager 2 in 1986 it is a narrow faint ring located just inside the ring between it and the shepherd moon cordelia this moon clears a dark lane just inside the ring when viewed in back-scattered light the ring is extremely narrowabout 12kmand has the equivalent optical depth 0102km at the wavelength 22m the normal optical depth is 0102 the optical depth of the ring shows strong wavelength dependence which is atypical for the uranian ring system the equivalent depth is as high as 036km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum which explains why ring was initially detected only in uv stellar occultations by voyager 2 the detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 22m was only announced in 1996 the appearance of the ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986 in this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the uranian ring system outshining the ring this observation together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth indicates that the ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust the normal optical depth of this dust is 1010 observations in 2007 by the keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion because the ring became one of the brightest features in the uranian ring system detailed analysis of the voyager 2 images revealed azimuthal variations in the brightness of the ring the variations appear to be periodic resembling a standing wave the origin of this fine structure in the ring remains a mystery 1986u2r ring in 1986 voyager 2 detected a broad and faint sheet of material inward of ring 6 this ring was given the temporary designation 1986u2r it had a normal optical depth of 10 or less and was extremely faint it was visible only in a single voyager 2 image the ring was located between 37000 and 39500km from the centre of uranus or only about 12000km above the clouds it was not observed again until 20032004 when the keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6 this ring was dubbed the ring the position of the recovered ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986 now it is situated between 37850 and 41350km from the centre of the planet there is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32600km or possibly even to 27000kmto the atmosphere of uranus these extensions are labelled as the c and cc rings respectively the ring was observed again during the ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when it became the brightest feature of the ring system outshining all other rings combined the equivalent optical depth of this ring is near 1km 06km for the inward extension while the normal optical depth is again less than 10 rather different appearances of the 1986u2r and rings may be caused by different viewing geometries back-scattering geometry in 20032007 and side-scattering geometry in 1986 changes during the past 20 years in the distribution of dust which is thought to predominate in the ring cannot be ruled out other dust bands in addition to the 1986u2r and rings there are other extremely faint dust bands in the uranian ring system they are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth though they are bright in forward-scattered light voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the and rings between the and rings and between the ring and ring 4 many of these bands were detected again in 20032004 by the keck telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the voyager observations the normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10 or less the dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p2505 in addition to separate dust bands the system of uranian rings appears to be immersed into wide and faint sheet of dust with the normal optical depth not exceeding 10 outer ring system in 20032005 the hubble space telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings now called the outer ring system which brought the number of known uranian rings to 13 these rings were subsequently named the and rings the ring is the outermost of the pair and is twice the distance from the planet as the bright ring the outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings in a number of respects they are broad 17000and 3800km wide respectively and very faint their peak normal optical depths are 8510 and 5410 respectively the resulting equivalent optical depths are 014km and 0012km the rings have triangular radial brightness profiles the peak brightness of the ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small uranian moon mab which is probably the source of the rings particles the ring is positioned between portia and rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it a reanalysis of the voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the and rings in this geometry the rings are much brighter which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust the outer rings of uranus may be similar to the g and e rings of saturn as e ring is extremely broad and receives dust from enceladus the ring may consist entirely of dust without any large particles at all this hypothesis is supported by observations performed by the keck telescope which failed to detect the ring in the near infrared at 22m but detected the ring this failure means that the ring is blue in color which in turn indicates that very small submicrometer dust predominates within it the dust may be made of water ice in contrast the ring is slightly red in color dynamics and origin an outstanding problem concerning the physics governing the narrow uranian rings is their confinement without some mechanism to hold their particles together the rings would quickly spread out radially the lifetime of the uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1million years the most widely cited model for such confinement proposed initially by goldreich and tremaine is that a pair of nearby moons outer and inner shepherds interact gravitationally with a ring and act like sinks and donors respectively for excessive and insufficient angular momentum or equivalently energy the shepherds thus keep ring particles in place but gradually move away from the ring themselves to be effective the masses of the shepherds should exceed the mass of the ring by at least a factor of two to three this mechanism is known to be at work in the case of the ring where cordelia and ophelia serve as shepherds cordelia is also the outer shepherd of the ring and ophelia is the outer shepherd of the ring no moon larger than 10km is known in the vicinity of other rings the current distance of cordelia and ophelia from the ring can be used to estimate the rings age the calculations show that the ring cannot be older than 600 million years since the rings of uranus appear to be young they must be continuously renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies the estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of puck is a few billion years the lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter therefore all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles including dust eventually the majority of mass was lost and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding the end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present the maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km the origin of the dust bands is less problematic the dust has a very short lifetime 1001000 years and should be continuously replenished by collisions between larger ring particles moonlets and meteoroids from outside the uranian system the belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light the narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution the main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings leading to high optical density in back-scattered light in contrast the dust bands have relatively few large particles which results in low optical depth exploration the rings were thoroughly investigated by the voyager 2 spacecraft in january 1986 two new faint rings and 1986u2rwere discovered bringing the total number then known to eleven rings were studied by analyzing results of radio ultraviolet and optical occultations voyager 2 observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun producing images with back-scattered forward-scattered and side-scattered light analysis of these images allowed derivation of the complete phase function geometrical and bond albedo of ring particles two rings and were resolved in the images revealing a complicated fine structure analysis of voyagers images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of uranus including the two shepherd moons of
