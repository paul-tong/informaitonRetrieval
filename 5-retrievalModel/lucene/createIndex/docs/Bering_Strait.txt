the bering strait is a strait of the pacific which separates russia and alaska slightly south of the arctic circle at about 65 40 n latitude the present russia-us east-west boundary is at 168 58 37 w the strait is named after vitus bering a danish explorer in the service of the russian empire the strait has been the subject of the scientific hypothesis that humans migrated from asia to north america across a land bridge known as beringia when lower ocean levels perhaps a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it this view of how paleo-indians entered america has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century since 2012 the russian coast of the bering strait has been a closed military zone through organized trips and the use of special permits it is possible for foreigners to visit all arrivals must be through an airport or a cruise port near the bering strait only at anadyr or provideniya unauthorized travelers who arrive on shore after crossing the strait even those with visas may be arrested imprisoned briefly fined deported and banned from future visas geography and science the bering strait is about 82 kilometres 51mi wide at its narrowest point between cape dezhnev chungu peninsula russia the easternmost point 167 42 w of the asian continent and cape prince of wale alaska united states the westernmost point 164 15 w of the north american continent its depth varies between 30 metres 98ft and 50 metres 160ft it borders with the chukchi sea part of the arctic ocean to north and with the bering sea to south the international date line runs equidistant between the straits diomede islands at a distance of 15km 1mi leaving the russian and american sides usually on different calendar days with cape dezhnev 21 hours ahead of the american side 20 hours during daylight saving time population the area is sparsely populated the eastern coast belongs to the us state of alaska notable towns on the american coast of the strait include nome 3788 people and the small settlement of teller 228 people the western coast belongs to the chukotka autonomous okrug a federal subject of russia major towns that lie along the strait include lorino 1267 people and lavrentiya 1459 people the diomede islands lie midway in the strait the village in little diomede has a school which belongs to alaskas bering strait school district expeditions the earliest reference of the strait were from maps from the polo family based on the adventures of marco polo from at least 1562 european geographers thought that there was a strait of anin between asia and north america in 1648 semyon dezhnyov probably passed through the strait but his report did not reach europe danish-born russian navigator vitus bering entered it in 1728 in 1732 mikhail gvozdev crossed it for the first time from asia to america adolf erik nordenskild in 187879 sailed along the northern coast of siberia thereby proving that there was no northern land bridge from asia to north america in march 1913 captain max gottschalk german crossed from the east cape of siberia to shishmaref alaska on dogsled via little and big diomede islands he was the first documented modern voyager to cross from russia to north america without the use of a boat in 1987 swimmer lynne cox swam a 43-kilometre 27mi course between the diomede islands from alaska to the soviet union in 33c 379f water during the last years of the cold war in june and july 1989 three teams of sea kayakers combined to attempt the first modern sea kayak crossing of the bering strait the groups were seven alaskans referring to their effort as paddling into tomorrow crossing the international dateline a four-man british expedition kayaks across the bering strait and an unnamed group of three californians in 1998 russian adventurer dmitry shparo and his son matvey crossed the frozen bering strait on skis in march 2006 briton karl bushby and french-american adventurer dimitri kieffer crossed the strait on foot walking across a frozen 90km 56mi section in 15 days they were soon arrested for not entering russia through a border control august 2008 marked the first crossing of the bering strait using an amphibious road-going vehicle the specially modified land rover defender 110 was driven by steve burgess and dan evans across the straits on its second attempt following the interruption of the first by bad weather in february 2012 a korean team led by hong sung-taek crossed the straits on foot in six days they started from chukotka peninsula the east coast of russia on february 23 and arrived in wales the western coastal town in alaska on february 29 in july 2012 six adventurers associated with dangerous waters a reality adventure show under production made the crossing on sea-doos but were arrested and permitted to return to alaska on their sea-doos after being briefly detained in lavrentiya administrative center of the chukotsky district they were treated well and given a tour of the villages museum but not permitted to continue south along the pacific coast the men had visas but the western coast of the bering strait is a closed military zone between august 4 and 10 us time 2013 a team of 65 swimmers from 17 countries performed a relay swim across the bering strait the first such swim in history they swam from cape dezhnev russia to cape prince of wales united states roughly 110km due to the current they had direct support from the russian navy using one of its ships and assistance with permission proposed crossing a physical link between asia and north america via the bering strait nearly became a reality in 1864 when a russian-american telegraph company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting europe and america via the east it was abandoned when the undersea atlantic cable proved successful a further proposal for a bridge-and-tunnel link from siberia to alaska was made by french engineer baron loicq de lobel in 1906 czar nicholas ii of russia issued an order authorising a franco-american syndicate represented by de lobel to begin work on the trans-siberian alaska railroad project but no physical work ever commenced suggestions have been made to construct a bering strait bridge between alaska and siberia however despite the unprecedented engineering political and financial challenges russia green-lighted the us 65-billion tkm-world link tunnel project in august 2011 if completed the 103km 64 mile project would have been the worlds longest china considered construction of a china-russia-canada-america railroad line that would include construction of a 200km 120mi long underwater tunnel that would cross the bering strait proposed dam in 1956 the soviet union proposed to the us a joint bi-national project to warm the arctic ocean and melt some of the ice cap as designed by petr borisov the soviet project called for a 90km 56mi wide dam across the bering strait it would block the cold pacific current from entering the arctic by pumping low-salinity cold surface water across the dam to the pacific warmer and higher salinity sea water from the atlantic ocean would be introduced into the arctic ocean however citing national security concerns the cia and fbi experts opposed the soviet plan by arguing that while the plan was feasible it would compromise norad and thus the dam could be built at only an immense cost soviet scientist d a drogaytsev also opposed the idea stating that the sea north of the dam and north-flowing rivers in siberia would become unnavigable year round and extend the gobi and other deserts to the northern siberia coastline american charles p steinmetz earlier proposed to widen the bering strait by removing st lawrence island and parts of seward and chukotski peninsulas a strait 200 miles wide would let the japan current melt the arctic ocean in the 21st century another dam has also been proposed however the aim of the proposal is to preserve the arctic ice cap against global warming ice curtain border during the cold war the bering strait marked the border between the soviet union and the united states the diomede islandsbig diomede russia and little diomede usare only 38km 24mi apart traditionally the indigenous peoples in the area had frequently crossed the border back and forth for routine visits seasonal festivals and subsistence trade but were prevented from doing so during the cold war the border became known as the ice curtain it was completely closed and there was no regular passenger air or boat traffic in 1987 american swimmer lynne cox symbolically helped ease tensions between the two countries by swimming across the border and was congratulated jointly by ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev see also geography portal list of russian explorers old bering sea strait of anin pbs video of st lawrence island in bering strait
