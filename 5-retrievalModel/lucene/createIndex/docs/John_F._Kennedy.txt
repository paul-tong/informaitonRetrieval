came he would not have to die without religion but these things cant be faked he added theres no bluffing two decades later kennedy and koehlers stepson us senator claiborne pell had become good

gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to fight or surrender kennedy stated theres nothing in the book about a situation like this a lot of you men have families and some of you have children what do you want to do i have nothing to lose shunning surrender around 200pm on august 2 the men swam towards plum pudding island 35 miles 56km southwest of the

swim 375 miles 604km southeast to olasana island which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on plum pudding island they swam against a strong current and once again kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist pappy macmahon by his life vest the somewhat larger olasana island had ripe coconut trees but still no fresh water on the following day august 5 kennedy and ensign george ross made the one hour swim to naru island an additional distance of about 5 miles 080km southwest in search of help and food kennedy and ross found a small canoe packages of crackers candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the japanese which kennedy paddled another half mile back to olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew lieutenant bud liebenow a friend and

torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitting her in one month into a heavily armed gunboat bristling with two large automatic 40 cal and ten automatic 50 caliber guns the plan was to attach one gunboat to each pt boat section to add gun range and power against barges and shore batteries which the 59 encountered on several occasions in mid october through mid november on october 8 kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant on november 2 kennedys pt-59 took part with two other pts in the successful rescue of 40-50 marines the 59 acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the warrior river at choiseul island taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety under doctors orders kennedy was relieved of his command of pt-59 on november 18 and sent to the hospital on tulagi from there he returned to the united states in early january 1944 after receiving treatment for his back injury he was released from active

a resort and temporary military hospital in arizona after the war kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the silver star medal for which he had been recommended initially his father also requested the silver star which is awarded for gallantry in action for his son in 1950 the department of the navy offered kennedy a bronze star medal in recognition of his meritorious service which he declined kennedys two original medals are currently on display at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum on august 12

lieutenant then lieutenant junior grade kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore his outstanding courage endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the united states naval service journalism in april 1945 kennedys father who was a friend of william randolph hearst arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for hearst newspapers the assignment kept kennedys name in the public eye and exposed him to journalism as a possible career he worked as a correspondent that may covering the potsdam conference and other events congressional career 19471960 jfks elder brother joe had been the familys political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency joes death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the task now fell to the second eldest of the kennedy siblings john f kennedy house of representatives 19471953 at the urging of kennedys father us representative james michael curley vacated his seat in the strongly democratic 11th congressional district of massachusetts to become mayor of boston in 1946 with his father financing and running his campaign kennedy won the democratic primary with 12 percent of the vote defeating ten other candidates though republicans took control of the house in the 1946 elections kennedy defeated his republican opponent in the general election taking 73 percent of the vote along with richard nixon and joseph mccarthy kennedy was one of several world war ii veterans first elected to congress that year he served in the house for six years joining the influential education and labor committee and the veterans affairs committee he concentrated his attention on international affairs supporting the truman doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging cold war he also supported public housing and opposed the labor management relations act of 1947 which restricted the power of labor unions though not as vocal an anticommunist as mccarthy congressman kennedy supported the immigration and nationality act of 1952 which required communists to register with the government and he deplored the loss of china having served as a boy scout during his childhood kennedy was active in the boston council from 1946 to 1955 as district vice chairman member of the executive board vice-president as well as a national council representative senate 19531960 as early as 1949 kennedy began preparing to run for the senate in 1952 against republican three-term incumbent henry cabot lodge jr with the campaign slogan kennedy will do more for massachusetts joseph kennedy again financed and managed his sons candidacy while john kennedys younger brother robert kennedy emerged as an important member of the campaign in the presidential election general dwight d eisenhower carried massachusetts by a margin of 208000 votes but kennedy defeated lodge by 70000 votes for the senate seat the following year he married jacqueline bouvier kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years often absent from the senate he was at times critically ill and received catholic last rites during his convalescence in 1956 he published profiles in courage a book about us senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in 1957 rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter ted sorensen were confirmed in sorensens 2008 autobiography at the 1956 democratic national convention senator kennedy gave the nominating speech for the partys presidential nominee adlai stevenson ii stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee kennedy finished second in the balloting losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result one of the matters demanding kennedys attention in the senate was president eisenhowers bill for the civil rights act of 1957 kennedy cast a procedural vote on this which was considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill kennedy did vote for title iii of the act which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin but majority leader lyndon b johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure kennedy also voted for title iv termed the jury trial amendment many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act a final compromise bill which kennedy supported was passed in september 1957 the following year kennedy authored a nation of immigrants later published in 1964 which analyzed the importance of immigration in the countrys history as well as proposals to re-evaluate immigration law in 1958 kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the senate defeating his republican opponent boston lawyer vincent j celeste by a wide margin of 874608 votes this represented the largest ever margin in massachusetts politics it was during his re-election campaign that kennedys press secretary at the time robert e thompson put together a film entitled the us senator john f kennedy story which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time in the aftermath of his re-election kennedy began preparing to run for president in 1960 while kennedys father was a strong supporter of senator joseph mccarthy mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family bobby kennedy worked for mccarthys subcommittee and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia in 1954 the senate voted to censure mccarthy and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure however it was not delivered because kennedy was hospitalized at the time the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community including eleanor roosevelt in the 1956 and 1960 elections 1960 presidential election on january 2 1960 kennedy announced his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination though some questioned kennedys youth and experience his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters his greatest obstacle to winning the nomination may have been his religion many americans held anti-catholic attitudes but kennedys vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation his religion also helped him win a devoted following among many catholic voters kennedy faced several potential challengers for the democratic nomination including senate majority leader lyndon b johnson adlai stevenson ii and senator hubert humphrey kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among democratic elites and voters at the time party officials controlled most of the delegates but several states also held primaries and kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination in his first major test kennedy won the wisconsin primary effectively ending humphreys hopes of winning the presidency nonetheless kennedy and humphrey faced each other in a competitive west virginia primary in which kennedy could not benefit from a catholic bloc as he had in wisconsin kennedy won the west virginia primary impressing many in the party but at the start of the 1960 democratic national convention it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination when kennedy entered the convention he had the most delegates but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination stevensonthe 1952 and 1956 presidential nomineeremained very popular in the party while johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders kennedys candidacy also faced opposition from former president harry s truman who was concerned about kennedys lack of experience kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to johnson or someone else and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother who wanted him to choose labor leader walter reuther and other liberal supporters when he chose johnson as his vice presidential nominee he believed that the texas senator could help him win support from the south the choice infuriated many in labor afl-cio president george meany called johnson the arch foe of labor while illinois afl-cio president reuben soderstrom asserted kennedy had made chumps out of leaders of the american labor movement in accepting the presidential nomination kennedy gave his well-known new frontier speech saying for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all wonand we stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promisesit is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them at the start of the fall general election campaign republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a six-point lead in the polls major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedys roman catholicism the cuban revolution and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decision-making he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september 12 1960 i am not the catholic candidate for president i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were catholic and once stated that no one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific between september and october kennedy squared off against nixon in the first televised presidential debates in us history during these programs nixon had an injured leg five oclock shadow and was perspiring making him look tense and uncomfortable conversely kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner on average radio listeners thought that nixon had won or that the debates were a draw the debates are now considered a milestone in american political historythe point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics kennedys campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls on election day kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century in the national popular vote by most accounts kennedy led nixon by just two-tenths of one percent 497 to 495 while in the electoral college he won 303 votes to nixons 219 269 were needed to win fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma kennedy became the youngest person 43 ever elected to the presidency though theodore roosevelt was a year younger at 42 when he automatically assumed the office after william mckinleys assassination in 1901 presidency 19611963 john f kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on january 20 1961 in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens famously saying ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us begin in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you the address reflected kennedys confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-general eisenhower and he wasted no time in scrapping eisenhowers methods kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet we can learn our jobs together he stated much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism and kennedy abruptly cut him off asking what do you want me to do about that today kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamaras controversial decision to award the contract for the f-111 tfx tactical fighter experimental fighter-bomber to general dynamics the choice of the civilian defense department over boeing the choice of the military at the request of senator henry jackson senator john mcclellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february to november 1963 during the summer of 1962 kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the white house most likely to aid his future memoir it recorded many conversations with kennedy and his cabinet members including those in relation to the cuban missile crisis foreign policy president kennedys foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war in 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev he started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early 1961 the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june 1961 on the way to the summit kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle who advised him to ignore khrushchevs abrasive style the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe nevertheless de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris on june 4 1961 the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received khrushchev for his part was impressed with the presidents intelligence but thought him weak kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin he made it clear that any treaty interfering with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war shortly after the president returned home the ussr announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city depressed and angry kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring in the weeks immediately following the vienna summit more than 20000 people fled from east berlin to the western sector reacting to statements from the ussr kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies in a july 1961 speech kennedy announced his decision to add 325billion equivalent to 2725billion in 2018 to the defense budget along with over 200000 additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us the speech received an 85 approval rating a month later both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall kennedys initial reaction was to ignore this as long as free access from west to east berlin continued this course was altered when west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states kennedy sent vice president johnson along with a host of military personnel in convoy through west germany including soviet-armed checkpoints to demonstrate the continued commitment of the us to west berlin kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may 5 1960 regarding americas conduct in the emerging cold war the address detailed how the american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying for we too founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule cuba and the bay of pigs invasion the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castros regime in cuba led by the central intelligence agency cia with help from the us military the plan was for an invasion of cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of us-trained anti-castro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people hoping to remove castro from power kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april 4 1961 the bay of pigs invasion began on april 17 1961 fifteen hundred us-trained cubans dubbed brigade 2506 landed on the island no us air support was provided cia director allen dulles later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground by april 19 1961 the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1189 survivors twenty months later cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for 53million worth of food and medicine the incident made castro feel wary of the us and led him to believe that another invasion would take place biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations when it proved unsuccessful he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it but maybe well learn something from it in late 1961 the white house formed the special group augmented headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others the groups objectiveto overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tacticswas never pursued cuban missile crisis on october 14 1962 cia u-2 spy planes took photographs of the soviets construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in cuba the photos were shown to kennedy on october 16 a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the ussr but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit more than a third of us national security council nsc members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse there was also some concern from the international community asked in confidence that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that eisenhower had placed pgm-19 jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in 1958 it also could not be assured that the assault would be 100 effective in concurrence with a majority-vote of the nsc kennedy decided on a naval quarantine on october 22 he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october 24 the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail united nations un secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period khrushchev agreed but kennedy didnt one soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded on october 28 khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm-27 polaris missiles this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after in the end the humanity of the two men prevailed the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the presidents credibility kennedys approval rating increased from 66 to 77 immediately thereafter latin america and communism believing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis muoz marn for the development of the alliance of progress and began working towards puerto ricos autonomy the eisenhower administration through the cia had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic when president kennedy took office he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the us his public position was in opposition in june 1961 the dominican republics leader was assassinated in the days following undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation robert kennedy who saw an opportunity for the us called bowles a gutless bastard to his face peace corps in one of his first presidential acts kennedy asked congress to create the peace corps his brother-in-law sargent shriver was its first director through this program americans volunteered to help developing nations in fields like education farming health care and construction the organization grew to 5000 members by march 1963 and 10000 the year after since 1961 over 200000 americans have joined the peace corps representing 139 different countries southeast asia when briefing kennedy eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle regarding the regional threat in march 1961 kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos indicating privately that vietnam and not laos should be deemed americas tripwire for communisms spread in the area in may he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem johnson assured diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem to defeat of communism in south vietnam during his presidency kennedy continued policies that provided political economic and military support to the south vietnamese government in late 1961 the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh kennedy increased the number of military advisors and special forces in the area from 11000 in 1962 to 16000 by late 1963 but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops a year and three months later on march 8 1965 his successor president lyndon johnson committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated us involvement with forces reaching 184000 that year and 536000 in 1968 in late 1961 president kennedy sent roger hilsman then director of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research to assess the situation in vietnam there hilsman met sir robert thompson head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam and the strategic hamlet program was formed it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem it was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation village internment and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents it was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government by november 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964 in early 1962 kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum subversive insurgency war of liberation operation ranch hand a large-scale aerial defoliation effort began on the roadsides of south vietnam depending on which assessment kennedy accepted department of defense or state there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded us involvement in april 1963 kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam saying we dont have a prayer of staying in vietnam those people hate us they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point but i cant give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to re-elect me on august 21 just as the new us ambassador henry cabot lodge jr arrived diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces funded and trained by the cia to quell buddhist demonstrations the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup dtat to remove diem with or perhaps by his brother nhu lodge was instructed to try getting diem and nhu to step down and leave the country diem would not listen to lodge cable 243 deptel 243 followed dated august 24 declaring that washington would no longer tolerate nhus actions and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu lodge concluded that the only option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu at weeks end orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables at the same time the first formal anti-vietnam war sentiment was expressed by us clergy from the ministers vietnam committee a white house meeting in september was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the departments of defense general victor krulak and state joseph mendenhall krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any us influence kennedy reacted asking did you two gentlemen visit the same country the president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight in october 1963 the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d taylor to a vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from us representatives in vietnam in meetings with mcnamara taylor and lodge diem again refused to agree to governing measures helping to dispel mcnamaras previous optimism about diem taylor and mcnamara were enlightened by vietnams vice president nguyen ngoc tho choice of many to succeed diem who in detailed terms obliterated taylors information that the military was succeeding in the countryside at kennedys insistence the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals 1000 by years end and complete withdrawal in 1965 something the nsc considered to be a strategic fantasy in late october intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot the source vietnamese general duong van minh also known as big minh wanted to know the us position kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup excluding assassination on november 1 1963 south vietnamese generals led by big minh overthrew the diem government arresting and then killing diem and nhu kennedy was shocked by the deaths news of the coup led to renewed confidence initiallyboth in america and in south vietnamthat the war might be won mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia before leaving for dallas kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year he wanted an in depth study of every possible option including how to get out of there to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top when asked what he thought the president meant forrestal said it was devils advocate stuff historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated if kennedy not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964 fueling the debate were statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling the united states out of vietnam after the 1964 election the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw a position in which johnson disagreed kennedy had signed national security action memorandum nsam 263 dated october 11 which ordered the withdrawal of 1000 military personnel by years end and the bulk of them out by 1965 such an action would have been a policy reversal but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at american university on june 10 1963 at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision was made to vietnam in 2008 theodore sorensen wrote i would like to believe that kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all american instructors and advisors from vietnam but i do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do sorensen added that in his opinion vietnam was the only foreign policy problem handed off by jfk to his successor in no better and possibly worse shape than it was when he inherited it us involvement in the region escalated until his successor lyndon johnson directly deployed regular us military forces for fighting the vietnam war after kennedys assassination president johnson signed nsam 273 on november 26 1963 it reversed kennedys decision to withdraw 1000 troops and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese american university speech on june 10 1963 kennedy at the high point of his rhetorical powers delivered the commencement address at american university in washington dc also known as a strategy of peace not only did the president outline a plan to curb nuclear arms but he also laid out a hopeful yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the us and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race the president wished to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceivedyet it is the most important topic on earth world peace i speak of peace because of the new face of war in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn i speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational men world peace like community peace does not require that each man love his neighborit requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance our problems are man-madetherefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants the president also made two announcements 1 that the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and 2 that the us had postponed planned atmospheric tests west berlin speech in 1963 germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer at the same time french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a franco-west german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence to kennedys eyes this franco-german cooperation seemed directed against natos influence in europe on june 26 president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner i am a citizen of berlin a million people were on the street for the speech kennedy remarked to ted sorensen afterwards well never have another day like this one as long as we live israel in 1960 kennedy stated israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom subsequently as president kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel and he is credited as the founder of the us-israeli military alliance which would be continued under subsequent presidents kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship as he described it to golda meir between the us and israel kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in 1962 and beginning in 1963 was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry the mim-23 hawk as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies which were opposed by arab neighbors those policies included israels water project on the jordan river as result of this newly created security alliance kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in dimona which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the middle east after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government david ben-gurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december 21 1960 that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna when ben-gurion met with kennedy in new york he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being in a may 1963 letter to ben-gurion kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming ben-gurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency iaea inspections in 1962 the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime a science attach at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited according to seymour hersh the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance and with the full acquiescence of israel marc trachtenberg argued that although he was well aware of what the israelis were doing kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with americas non-proliferation policy the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israels nuclear weapons program rodger davies the director of the state departments office of near eastern affairs concluded in march 1965 that israel was developing nuclear weapons he reported that israels target date for achieving nuclear capability was 19681969 on may 1 1968 undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year the state department argued that if israel wanted arms it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty npt into contracts for the supply of us weapons continued throughout 1968 iraq relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july 14 1958 which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd al-karim qasim on june 25 1961 qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait declaring the latter nation an indivisible part of iraq and causing a short-lived kuwait crisis the united kingdomwhich had just granted kuwait independence on june 19 and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oilresponded on july 1 by dispatching 5000 troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion at the same time kennedy dispatched a us navy task force to bahrain and the uk at the urging of the kennedy administration brought the dispute to united nations security council where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union the situation was resolved in october when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4000-strong arab league force in december 1961 qasims government passed public law 80 which restricted the british- and american-owned iraq petroleum company ipcs concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced effectively expropriating 995 of the ipc concession us officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptian-sponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state which they believed were connected senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response qasim might grab kuwait thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production or throw himself into russian arms komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent and had the potential to get iraq back on a more neutral keel in april 1962 the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there meanwhile kennedy instructed the ciaunder the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jrto begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim the anti-imperialist and anti-communist iraqi baath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february 8 1963 while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate that there was no direct american involvement although the cia was actively seeking a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier baathist coup plot the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a 55-million arms deal for iraq ireland during his four-day visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june 1963 kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college dublin he visited the cottage at dunganstown near new ross county wexford where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america kennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas the irish parliament on december 22 2006 the irish department of justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit nuclear test ban treaty troubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty originally conceived in adlai stevensons 1956 presidential campaign in their vienna summit meeting in june 1961 khrushchev and kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september in response the united states conducted tests five days later shortly afterwards new us satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the ussr perceived itself to be at parity in july 1963 kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance ultimately the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but not underground the us senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october 1963 france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses domestic policy kennedy called his domestic program the new frontier it ambitiously promised federal funding for education medical care for the elderly economic aid to rural regions and government intervention to halt the recession he also promised an end to racial discrimination although his agenda which included the endorsement of the voter education project vep in 1962 produced little progress in areas such as mississippi where the vep concluded that discrimination was so entrenched in his 1963 state of the union address he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 2090 to a range of 1465 as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47 kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70 if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners congress did not act until 1964 a year after his death when the top individual rate was lowered to 70 and the top corporate rate was set at 48 to the economic club of new york he spoke in 1963 of the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now congress passed few of kennedys major programs during his lifetime but did vote them through in 1964 and 1965 under his successor johnson economy kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy he presided over the first government budget to top the 100billion mark in 1962 and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nations first non-war non-recession deficit the economy which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office accelerated notably throughout his administration despite low inflation and interest rates the gdp had grown by an average of only 22 per annum during the eisenhower administration scarcely more than population growth at the time and it had declined by 1 during eisenhowers last twelve months in office the economy turned around and prospered during kennedys years as president the gdp expanded by an average of 55 from early 1961 to late 1963 while inflation remained steady at around 1 and unemployment eased industrial production rose by 15 and motor vehicle sales increased by 40 this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until 1969 and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time attorney general robert kennedy took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices he stated were going for broke their expense accounts where theyve been and what theyve been doing the fbi is to interview them all we cant lose this the administrations actions influenced us steel to rescind the price increase the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted by naked power by threats and by agents of the state security police yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict us steel for collusion so quickly an editorial in the new york times praised kennedys actions and said that the steel industrys price increase imperiled the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation nevertheless the administrations bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus the stock market which had steadily declined since kennedys election in 1960 dropped 10 shortly after the administrations action on the steel industry took place federal and military death penalty during his administration kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v georgia a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions victor feguer was sentenced to death by an iowa federal court and was executed on march 15 1963 kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february 12 1962 changing the penalty to life in prison on march 22 1962 kennedy signed into law hr5143 pl87-423 which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the district of columbia the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty the death penalty has not been applied in the district of columbia since 1957 and has now been abolished civil rights movement the turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south the us supreme court had ruled in 1954 in brown v board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional many schools especially those in southern states did not obey the supreme courts decision the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities such as buses restaurants theaters courtrooms bathrooms and beaches but it continued nonetheless kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights during his 1960 presidential campaign he telephoned coretta scott king wife of the reverend martin luther king jr who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained kings release from prison which drew additional black support to his brothers candidacy upon taking office in 1961 kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960 recognizing that conservative southern democrats controlled congressional legislation historian carl m brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile during his first year in office kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his may appointment of civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the federal bench in his first state of the union address in january 1961 president kennedy said the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress including anti-poverty legislation and he distanced himself from it kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration such as the cold war bay of pigs fiasco and the situation in southeast asia as articulated by his brother robert the administrations early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess civil rights movement participants mainly those on the front line in the south viewed kennedy as lukewarm especially concerning the freedom riders who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence including by law enforcement officers both federal and state kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents robert kennedy speaking for the president urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstruction after the civil war among conservative southern whites on march 6 1961 kennedy signed executive order 10925 which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin it established the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity displeased with kennedys pace addressing the issue of segregation martin luther king jr and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation kennedy did not execute the order in september 1962 james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering in response to that robert kennedy now us attorney general sent 400 federal marshals while president kennedy reluctantly sent 3000 troops after the situation on campus turned out violent the ole miss riot of 1962 left two people dead and a dozen others injured but meredith did finally enroll for class kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began doubting as to whether the evils of reconstruction of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true the instigating subculture at the old miss riot and at many other racially ignited events was the ku klux klan on november 20 1962 kennedy signed executive order 11063 which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities both the president and the attorney general were concerned about kings ties to suspected communists jack odell and stanley levison after the president and his civil rights expert harris wofford pressed king to ask both men to resign from the sclc king agreed to ask only odell to resign from the organization and allowed levison whom he regarded as a trusted advisor to remain in early 1963 kennedy related to martin luther king jr his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation if we get into a long fight over this in congress it will bottleneck everything else and we will still get no bill civil rights clashes were on the rise that year brother robert and ted sorenson pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front on june 11 1963 president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students vivian malone and james hood from attending wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama us national guard which had just been federalized by order of the president that evening kennedy gave his famous report to the american people on civil rights on national television and radio launching his initiative for civil rights legislationto provide equal access to public schools and other facilities and greater protection of voting rights his proposals became part of the civil rights act of 1964 the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader medgar evers in front of his home in mississippi as the president had predicted the day after his tv speech and in reaction to it house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia area redevelopment administration had been defeated primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans when arthur m schlesinger jr complimented kennedy on his remarks kennedy bitterly replied yes and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house he then added but of course i had to give that speech and im glad that i did on june 16 the new york times published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment in regards to civil rights he now demonstrated a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life earlier kennedy had signed the executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women on december 14 1961 former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission the commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination its final report documenting legal and cultural barriers was issued in october 1963 further on june 10 1963 kennedy signed the equal pay act of 1963 which amended the fair labor standards act and abolished wage disparity based on sex over a hundred thousand predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august 28 1963 kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress and declined an invitation to speak he turned over some of the details of the governments involvement to the dept of justice which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march including the naacp and martin luther kings southern christian leadership conference sclc to ensure a peaceful demonstration the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at 400pm thousands of troops were placed on standby kennedy watched kings speech on tv and was very impressed the march was considered a triumph of managed protest and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred afterwards the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill nevertheless the struggle was far from over three weeks later a bomb exploded on sunday september 15 at the 16th street baptist church in birmingham by the end of the day four african american children had died in the explosion and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath due to this resurgent violence the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill to the outrage of the president kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill without the additions had enough votes to get it out of the house committee gaining republican support senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster the legislation was enacted by kennedys successor president lyndon b johnson prompted by kennedys memory after his assassination in november enforcing voting rights public accommodations employment education and the administration of justice civil liberties in february 1962 fbi director j edgar hoover who was suspicious of civil-rights leader martin luther king jr and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker presented the kennedy administration with allegations that some of kings close confidants and advisers were communists concerned by these allegations the fbi deployed agents to monitor king in the following months robert kennedy and the president also both warned king to discontinue the suspect associations after the associations continued robert kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference kings civil rights organization in october 1963 although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of kings phones on a trial basis for a month or so hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of kings life they deemed worthy the wiretapping continued through june 1966 and was revealed in 1968 immigration during the 1960 campaign kennedy proposed an overhaul of american immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin he saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president these reforms later became law through the immigration and nationality act of 1965 which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia the policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification the late-presidents brother senator edward kennedy helped steer the legislation through the senate native american relations construction of the kinzua dam flooded 10000 acres 4047ha of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of 1794 and forced 600 seneca to relocate to salamanca new york kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to intervene and to halt the project but he declined citing a critical need for flood control he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land damages and assistance to help mitigate their displacement space policy the apollo program was conceived early in 1960 during the eisenhower administration as a follow-up to project mercury to be used as a shuttle to an earth-orbital space station flights around the moon or landing on it while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo funding for the program was far from certain given eisenhowers ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight as senator kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it in constructing his presidential administration kennedy elected to retain eisenhowers last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the presidents science advisory committee wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration having issued a report highly critical of project mercury kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e webb an experienced washington insider who served president truman as budget director and undersecretary of state webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress the president and the american people kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied in kennedys january 1961 state of the union address he had suggested international cooperation in space khrushchev declined as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities early in his presidency kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate kennedys advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost however this quickly changed on april 12 1961 when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union kennedy now became eager for the us to take the lead in the space race for reasons of national security and prestige on april 20 he sent a memo to johnson asking him to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up after consulting with wernher von braun johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first kennedys advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing and on may 25 kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled special message to the congress on urgent national needs i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish full text after congress authorized the funding webb began reorganizing nasa increasing its staffing level and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston texas kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september 12 1962 in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard full text on november 21 1962 in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige and that the expense was justified johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well costs for the apollo program were expected to reach 40 billion equivalent to 33131billion in 2018 in a september 1963 speech before the united nations kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space specifically recommending that apollo be switched to a joint expedition to the moon khrushchev again declined and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until 1964 on july 20 1969 almost six years after kennedys death apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon administration cabinet and judicial appointments judicial appointments supreme court kennedy appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states byron white 1962 arthur goldberg 1962 other courts in addition to his two supreme court appointments kennedy appointed 21 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 102 judges to the united states district courts assassination president kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas at 1230pm central standard time on friday november 22 1963 he was in texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the democratic party between liberals ralph yarborough and don yarborough no relation and conservative john connally traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown dallas he was shot once in the back the bullet exiting via his throat and once in the head kennedy was taken to parkland hospital for emergency medical treatment where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later he was 46 years old and had been in office for 1036 days lee harvey oswald an order filler at the texas school book depository from which the shots were suspected to have been fired was arrested for the murder of police officer jd tippit and was subsequently charged with kennedys assassination he denied shooting anyone claiming he was a patsy and was shot by jack ruby on november 24 before he could be prosecuted ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on january 3 1967 while the date for his new trial was being set president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commissionchaired by chief justice earl warrento investigate the assassination the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy the results of this investigation are disputed by many the assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in us history because of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions a 2004 fox news poll found that 66 of americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill president kennedy while 74 thought that there had been a cover-up a gallup poll in november 2013 showed 61 believed in a conspiracy and only 30 thought that oswald did it alone in 1979 the us house select committee on assassinations concluded that it believed that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy in 2002 historian carl m brauer concluded that the publics fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of kennedys death a mass wish to undo it funeral a requiem mass was celebrated for kennedy at the cathedral of st matthew the apostle on november 25 1963 afterwards kennedy was interred in a small plot 20by 30ft in arlington national cemetery over a period of three years 19641966 an estimated 16million people visited his grave on march 14 1967 kennedys remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial it was from this memorial that the graves of both robert and ted kennedy were modeled the honor guard at kennedys graveside was the 37th cadet class of the irish army kennedy was greatly impressed by the irish cadets on his last official visit to ireland so much so that jackie kennedy requested the irish army to be the honor guard at her husbands funeral kennedys wife jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot jfks brother robert was buried nearby in june 1968 in august 2009 ted was also buried near his two brothers john f kennedys grave is lit with an eternal flame kennedy and william howard taft are the only two us presidents buried at arlington according to the jfk library i have a rendezvous with death by alan seeger was one of john f kennedys favorite poems and he often asked his wife to recite it personal life family and reputation the kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the united states having produced a president three senators three ambassadors and multiple other representatives and politicians both at the federal and state level while a congressman kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to india japan vietnam and israel in 1951 at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother bobby as well as his 27-year-old sister pat because they were several years apart in age the brothers had previously seen little of each other this 25000-mile 40000km trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends bobby would eventually play a major role in his brothers career serving as his brothers attorney general and presidential advisor bobby would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination while another kennedy brother ted ran for president in 1980 kennedy came in third behind martin luther king jr and mother teresa in gallups list of widely admired people of the 20th century kennedy was a life member of the national rifle association wife and children kennedy met his future wife jacqueline lee jackie bouvier 19291994 when he was a congressman charles l bartlett a journalist introduced the pair at a dinner party they were married a year after he was elected senator on september 12 1953 after suffering a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 their daughter arabella their daughter caroline was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of jfks immediate family john fitzgerald kennedy jr nicknamed john-john by the press as a child was born in late november 1960 17 days after his father was elected john jr a graduate of brown university died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to marthas vineyard in 1963 months before jfks assassination jackie gave birth to a son patrick however he passed away after 2 days due to complications from birth popular image kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines although eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium in 1961 the radio-television news directors association presented kennedy with its highest honor the paul white award in recognition of his open relationship with the media mrs kennedy brought new art and furniture to the white house and directed its restoration they invited a range of artists writers and intellectuals to rounds of white house dinners raising the profile of the arts in america on the white house lawn the kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house while caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home the president was closely tied to popular culture emphasized by songs such as twisting at the white house vaughn meaders first family comedy album which parodied the president the first lady their family and the administration sold about four million copies on may 19 1962 marilyn monroe sang happy birthday mr president at a large party in madison square garden celebrating kennedys upcoming forty-fifth birthday camelot era the term camelot came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the kennedy administration and the charisma of kennedy and his family the term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination life magazine interview with theodore h white in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name particularly the closing lines of the title song dont let it be forgot that once there was a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as camelot therell be great presidents again but there will never be another camelot health in 2002 robert dallek wrote an extensive history of kennedys health dallek was able to consult a collection of kennedy-associated papers from the years 19551963 including x-rays and prescription records from the files of white house physician dr janet travell according to travells records during his presidential years kennedy suffered from high fevers stomach colon and prostate issues abscesses high cholesterol and adrenal problems travell kept a medicine administration record cataloguing kennedys medications injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back lomotil metamucil paregoric phenobarbital testosterone and trasentine to control his diarrhea abdominal discomfort and weight loss penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess and tuinal to help him sleep years after kennedys death it was revealed that in september 1947 while kennedy was 30 and in his first term in congress he was diagnosed by sir daniel davis at the london clinic with addisons disease a rare endocrine disorder in 1966 dr travell revealed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 aps 2 kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain for which he had surgery and was written up in the american medical associations archives of surgery kennedys condition may have had diplomatic repercussions as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 vienna summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the combination included hormones animal organ cells steroids vitamins enzymes and amphetamines and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity hypertension impaired judgment nervousness and mood swings kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors one of whom max jacobson was unknown to the other two as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain into late 1961 disagreements existed among kennedys doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise the president preferred the former because he was short on time and desired immediate relief during that time the presidents physician george burkley did set up some gym equipment in the white house basement where kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during kennedys lifetime the presidents primary white house physician george burkley realized that treatments by jacobson and travell including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines were medically inappropriate and took effective action to remove the president from their care it was later observed that president kennedys leadership eg the 1962 cuban missile crisis and other events during 1963 improved greatly once the treatments of jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under burkley dr ghaemi who studied kennedys medical records concluded there was a correlation it is not causation but it may not be coincidence either personal tragedies kennedy and his family have experienced a number of personal tragedies his older brother joseph p kennedy jr was killed in action in 1944 at age 29 when his plane exploded over the english channel during a first attack execution of operation aphrodite during world war ii kennedys younger sister rose marie rosemary kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23 leaving her incapacitated for the rest of her life until her death in 2005 his younger sister kathleen agnes kick kennedy died in a plane crash en route to france in 1948 his wife jacqueline kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 a daughter informally named arabella a son patrick bouvier kennedy died two days after birth in august 1963 affairs extramarital relationships and friendships kennedy was single in the 1940s when he had affairs with danish journalist inga arvad and actress gene tierney before and after he assumed the presidency kennedy reportedly had extramarital affairs with a number of women including marilyn monroe gunilla von post judith campbell mary pinchot meyer marlene dietrich mimi alford and his wifes press secretary pamela turnure the extent of kennedys relationship with monroe is not fully known although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in march 1962 while he was staying at bing crosbys house furthermore people at the white house switchboard noted that monroe had called kennedy during 1962 j edgar hoover the fbi director received reports about kennedys indiscretions kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters according to reeves this included the logistics of kennedys liaisons which required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them kennedy would often and even when married share a bedroom with his lifelong and close friend lem billings historical evaluations and legacy the us special forces had a special bond with kennedy it was president kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the special forces and giving us back our green beret said forrest lindley a writer for the us military newspaper stars and stripes who served with special forces in vietnam this bond was shown at kennedys funeral at the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of kennedys death general michael d healy the last commander of special forces in vietnam spoke at arlington cemetery later a wreath in the form of the green beret would be placed on the grave continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of special forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the us navy and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command the navy seals which kennedy enthusiastically supported kennedys civil rights proposals led to the civil rights act of 1964 president lyndon b johnson kennedys successor took up the mantle and pushed the landmark civil rights act through a bitterly divided congress by invoking the slain presidents memory president johnson then signed the act into law on july 2 1964 this civil rights law ended what was known as the solid south and certain provisions were modeled after the civil rights act of 1875 signed into law by president ulysses s grant kennedys continuation of presidents harry s truman and dwight d eisenhowers policies of giving economic and military aid to south vietnam left the door open for president johnsons escalation of the conflict at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam leading historians cabinet members and writers to continue to disagree on whether the vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived his agreement to the nsam 263 action of withdrawing 1000 troops by the end of 1963 and his earlier 1963 speech at american university suggest that he was ready to end the vietnam war the vietnam war contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties amid violent disappointment on the political landscape many of kennedys speeches especially his inaugural address are considered iconic and despite his relatively short term in office and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents in the same league as abraham lincoln george washington and franklin d roosevelt some excerpts of kennedys inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at arlington in 2018 the times published an audio recreation of the watchmen on the walls of world freedom speech he was scheduled to deliver at the dallas trade mart on november 22 1963 he was posthumously awarded the pacem in terris award latin peace on earth it was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by pope john xxiii that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father he is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent his maternal grandmother mary josephine josie hannon died in august 1964 nine months after his assassination throughout the english-speaking world the given name kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of president kennedy as well his brother robert effect of assassination television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding john f kennedys assassination in fact television started to come of age before the assassination on september 2 1963 kennedy helped inaugurate network televisions first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with cbs evening news anchor walter cronkite newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information in this sense his assassination was the first major tv news event of its kind tv coverage united the nation interpreting what went on and creating memories of this space in time all three major us television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from november 22 through november 26 1963 being on the air for 70 hours making it the longest uninterrupted news event on american tv until 911 the assassination had an effect on many people not only in the us but around the world many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that kennedy was assassinated as with the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 before it and the september 11 attacks after it un ambassador adlai stevenson said of the assassination all of us will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours many people have also spoken of the shocking news compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassins the possible instigators and the causes of the killing as an end to innocence and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s especially the vietnam war ultimately the death of president kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the american people in the political establishmenta point made by
