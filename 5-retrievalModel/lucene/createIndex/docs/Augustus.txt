augustus latin imperator caesar divi filius augustus 23 september 63 bc 19 august ad 14 was a roman statesman and military leader who was the first emperor of the roman empire controlling imperial rome from 27 bc until his death in ad 14 his status as the founder of the roman principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history the reign of augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the pax romana the roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the empires frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the year of the four emperors over the imperial succession augustus was born gaius octavius thurinus into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens octavia his maternal great-uncle julius caesar was assassinated in 44 bc and octavius was named in caesars will as his adopted son and heir along with mark antony and marcus lepidus he formed the second triumvirate to defeat the assassins of caesar following their victory at the battle of philippi the triumvirate divided the roman republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators the triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position and antony committed suicide following his defeat at the battle of actium by octavian in 31 bc after the demise of the second triumvirate augustus restored the outward faade of the free republic with governmental power vested in the roman senate the executive magistrates and the legislative assemblies in reality however he retained his autocratic power over the republic as a military dictator by law augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the senate including supreme military command and those of tribune and censor it took several years for augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule he rejected monarchical titles and instead called himself princeps civitatis first citizen of the state the resulting constitutional framework became known as the principate the first phase of the roman empire augustus dramatically enlarged the empire annexing egypt dalmatia pannonia noricum and raetia expanding possessions in africa and completing the conquest of hispania but suffered a major setback in germania beyond the frontiers he secured the empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the parthian empire through diplomacy he reformed the roman system of taxation developed networks of roads with an official courier system established a standing army established the praetorian guard created official police and fire-fighting services for rome and rebuilt much of the city during his reign augustus died in ad 14 at the age of 75 probably from natural causes however there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife livia poisoned him he was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son also stepson and former son-in-law tiberius name as a consequence of roman customs society and personal preference augustus sts s- classical latinawsts was known by many names throughout his life gaius octavius thurinus ktevis he received his birth name after his biological father in 63 bc gaius was his praenomen octavius was his nomen and thurinus was his cognomen later his rival mark antony used the name thurinus as an insult to which augustus replied surprised that using his old name was thought to be an insult gaius julius caesar after he was adopted by julius caesar he adopted caesars name in accordance with roman naming conventions while he dropped all references to the octavius family people colloquially added the epithet octavianus to his legal name either to differentiate him from his adoptive father or to highlight his more modest origins modern historians refer to him using the anglicized form octavian ktevin between 44 bc and 27 bc gaius julius caesar divi filius two years after his adoption he founded the temple of caesar additionally adding the title divi filius son of the divine to his name in attempt to strengthen his political ties to caesars former soldiers following the deification of caesar imperator caesar divi filius from 38 bc octavian opted to use imperator the title by which troops hailed their leader after military success his name is roughly translated as commander caesar son of the divine imperator caesar divi filius augustus following his 31 bc defeat of mark antony and cleopatra partly on his own insistence the roman senate granted him the additional name augustus which he added to his previous names thereafter historians use this name to refer to him from 27 bc until his death in ad 14 early life while his paternal family was from the town of velletri approximately 40 kilometres 25mi from rome augustus was born in the city of rome on 23 september 63bc he was born at ox head a small property on the palatine hill very close to the roman forum he was given the name gaius octavius thurinus his cognomen possibly commemorating his fathers victory at thurii over a rebellious band of slaves suetonius wrote there are many indications that the octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at velitrae for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called octavian but an altar was shown there besides consecrated by an octavius this man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town due to the crowded nature of rome at the time octavius was taken to his fathers home village at velletri to be raised octavius only mentions his fathers equestrian family briefly in his memoirs his paternal great-grandfather gaius octavius was a military tribune in sicily during the second punic war his grandfather had served in several local political offices his father also named gaius octavius had been governor of macedonia his mother atia was the niece of julius caesar in 59bc when he was four years old his father died his mother married a former governor of syria lucius marcius philippus philippus claimed descent from alexander the great and was elected consul in 56bc philippus never had much of an interest in young octavius because of this octavius was raised by his grandmother julia the sister of julius caesar julia died in 52 or 51bc and octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother from this point his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him he donned the toga virilis four years later and was elected to the college of pontiffs in 47bc the following year he was put in charge of the greek games that were staged in honor of the temple of venus genetrix built by julius caesar according to nicolaus of damascus octavius wished to join caesars staff for his campaign in africa but gave way when his mother protested in 46bc she consented for him to join caesar in hispania where he planned to fight the forces of pompey caesars late enemy but octavius fell ill and was unable to travel when he had recovered he sailed to the front but was shipwrecked after coming ashore with a handful of companions he crossed hostile territory to caesars camp which impressed his great-uncle considerably velleius paterculus reports that after that time caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage when back in rome caesar deposited a new will with the vestal virgins naming octavius as the prime beneficiary rise to power heir to caesar octavius was studying and undergoing military training in apollonia illyria when julius caesar was killed on the ides of march 15 march 44bc he rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in macedonia and sailed to italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security caesar had no living legitimate children under roman law and so had adopted octavius his grand-nephew making him his primary heir mark antony later charged that octavian had earned his adoption by caesar through sexual favours though suetonius describes antonys accusation as political slander after landing at lupiae near brundisium octavius learned the contents of caesars will and only then did he decide to become caesars political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate upon his adoption octavius assumed his great-uncles name gaius julius caesar roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form eg octavianus for one who had been an octavius aemilianus for one who had been an aemilius etc however though some of his contemporaries did there is no evidence that octavius ever himself officially used the name octavianus as it would have made his modest origins too obvious historians usually refer to the new caesar as octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name augustus in 27bc in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the roman political hierarchy after a warm welcome by caesars soldiers at brundisium octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by caesar for the intended war against the parthian empire in the middle east this amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at brundisium the staging ground in italy for military operations in the east a later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against octavian since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the senates arch enemy mark antony octavian made another bold move in 44bc when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from romes near eastern province to italy octavian began to bolster his personal forces with caesars veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the parthian war gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to caesar on his march to rome through italy octavians presence and newly acquired funds attracted many winning over caesars former veterans stationed in campania by june he had gathered an army of 3000 loyal veterans paying each a salary of 500 denarii growing tensions arriving in rome on 6 may 44bc octavian found consul mark antony caesars former colleague in an uneasy truce with the dictators assassins they had been granted a general amnesty on 17 march yet antony had succeeded in driving most of them out of rome with an inflammatory eulogy at caesars funeral mounting public opinion against the assassins mark antony was amassing political support but octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting caesar mark antony had lost the support of many romans and supporters of caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate caesar to divine status octavian failed to persuade antony to relinquish caesars money to him during the summer he managed to win support from caesarian sympathizers and also made common with the optimates the former enemies of caesar who saw him as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him in september the leading optimate orator marcus tullius cicero began to attack antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the republican order first conflict with antony with opinion in rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end antony attempted to pass laws that would assign him the province of cisalpine gaul octavian meanwhile built up a private army in italy by recruiting caesarian veterans and on 28 november he won over two of antonys legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain in the face of octavians large and capable force antony saw the danger of staying in rome and to the relief of the senate he left rome for cisalpine gaul which was to be handed to him on 1 january however the province had earlier been assigned to decimus junius brutus albinus one of caesars assassins who now refused to yield to antony antony besieged him at mutina and rejected the resolutions passed by the senate to stop the fighting the senate had no army to enforce their resolutions this provided an opportunity for octavian who already was known to have armed forces cicero also defended octavian against antonys taunts about octavians lack of noble lineage and aping of julius caesars name stating we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth at the urging of cicero the senate inducted octavian as senator on 1 january 43bc yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls in addition octavian was granted propraetor imperium commanding power which legalized his command of troops sending him to relieve the siege along with hirtius and pansa the consuls for 43bc in april 43bc antonys forces were defeated at the battles of forum gallorum and mutina forcing antony to retreat to transalpine gaul both consuls were killed however leaving octavian in sole command of their armies the senate heaped many more rewards on decimus brutus than on octavian for defeating antony then attempted to give command of the consular legions to decimus brutus in response octavian stayed in the po valley and refused to aid any further offensive against antony in july an embassy of centurions sent by octavian entered rome and demanded the consulship left vacant by hirtius and pansa and also that the decree should be rescinded which declared antony a public enemy when this was refused he marched on the city with eight legions he encountered no military opposition in rome and on 19 august 43bc was elected consul with his relative quintus pedius as co-consul meanwhile antony formed an alliance with marcus aemilius lepidus another leading caesarian second triumvirate proscriptions in a meeting near bologna in october 43bc octavian antony and lepidus formed the second triumvirate this explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then legalised by law passed by the plebs unlike the unofficial first triumvirate formed by pompey julius caesar and marcus licinius crassus the triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which between 130 and 300 senators and 2000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and for those who failed to escape their lives this decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against caesars assassins marcus junius brutus and gaius cassius longinus rewards for their arrest gave incentive for romans to capture those proscribed while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs contemporary roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing however the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies marcus velleius paterculus asserted that octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas lepidus and antony were to blame for initiating them cassius dio defended octavian as trying to spare as many as possible whereas antony and lepidus being older and involved in politics longer had many more enemies to deal with this claim was rejected by appian who maintained that octavian shared an equal interest with lepidus and antony in eradicating his enemies suetonius said that octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials but did pursue his enemies with more vigor than the other triumvirs plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among antony lepidus and octavian for example octavian allowed the proscription of his ally cicero antony the proscription of his maternal uncle lucius julius caesar the consul of 64 bc and lepidus his brother paullus battle of philippi and division of territory on 1 january 42bc the senate posthumously recognized julius caesar as a divinity of the roman state divus iulius octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was divi filius son of the divine antony and octavian then sent 28 legions by sea to face the armies of brutus and cassius who had built their base of power in greece after two battles at philippi in macedonia in october 42 the caesarian army was victorious and brutus and cassius committed suicide mark antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle octavian as both battles were decisively won with the use of antonys forces in addition to claiming responsibility for both victories antony also branded octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to marcus vipsanius agrippa instead after philippi a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the second triumvirate gaul and the province of hispania were placed in the hands of octavian antony traveled east to egypt where he allied himself with queen cleopatra vii the former lover of julius caesar and mother of caesars infant son caesarion lepidus was left with the province of africa stymied by antony who conceded hispania to octavian instead octavian was left to decide where in italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge the tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with brutus and cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of octavian if not appeased and they also required land there was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers so octavian had to choose one of two options alienating many roman citizens by confiscating their land or alienating many roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the roman heartland octavian chose the former there were as many as eighteen roman towns affected by the new settlements with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions rebellion and marriage alliances there was widespread dissatisfaction with octavian over these settlements of his soldiers and this encouraged many to rally at the side of lucius antonius who was brother of mark antony and supported by a majority in the senate meanwhile octavian asked for a divorce from clodia pulchra the daughter of fulvia mark antonys wife and her first husband publius clodius pulcher he returned clodia to her mother claiming that their marriage had never been consummated fulvia decided to take action together with lucius antonius she raised an army in italy to fight for antonys rights against octavian lucius and fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing octavian however since the roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at perusia modern perugia where octavian forced them into surrender in early 40bc lucius and his army were spared due to his kinship with antony the strongman of the east while fulvia was exiled to sicyon octavian showed no mercy however for the mass of allies loyal to lucius on 15 march the anniversary of julius caesars assassination he had 300 roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with lucius perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others this bloody event sullied octavians reputation and was criticized by many such as augustan poet sextus propertius sextus pompeius the son of pompey and still a renegade general following julius caesars victory over his father had established himself in sicily and sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the second triumvirate in 39bc both antony and octavian were vying for an alliance with pompeius octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40bc when he married scribonia a sister or daughter of pompeius father-in-law lucius scribonius libo scribonia gave birth to octavians only natural child julia the same day that he divorced her to marry livia drusilla little more than a year after their marriage while in egypt antony had been engaged in an affair with cleopatra and had fathered three children with her aware of his deteriorating relationship with octavian antony left cleopatra he sailed to italy in 40bc with a large force to oppose octavian laying siege to brundisium this new conflict proved untenable for both octavian and antony however their centurions who had become important figures politically refused to fight due to their caesarian cause while the legions under their command followed suit meanwhile in sicyon antonys wife fulvia died of a sudden illness while antony was en route to meet her fulvias death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation in the autumn of 40 octavian and antony approved the treaty of brundisium by which lepidus would remain in africa antony in the east octavian in the west the italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers but in reality this provision was useless for antony in the east to further cement relations of alliance with mark antony octavian gave his sister octavia minor in marriage to antony in late 40bc war with pompeius sextus pompeius threatened octavian in italy by denying shipments of grain through the mediterranean sea to the peninsula pompeius own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in italy pompeius control over the sea prompted him to take on the name neptuni filius son of neptune a temporary peace agreement was reached in 39bc with the treaty of misenum the blockade on italy was lifted once octavian granted pompeius sardinia corsica sicily and the peloponnese and ensured him a future position as consul for 35bc the territorial agreement between the triumvirate and sextus pompeius began to crumble once octavian divorced scribonia and married livia on 17 january 38bc one of pompeius naval commanders betrayed him and handed over corsica and sardinia to octavian octavian lacked the resources to confront pompeius alone however so an agreement was reached with the second triumvirates extension for another five-year period beginning in 37bc in supporting octavian antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against the parthian empire desiring to avenge romes defeat at carrhae in 53bc in an agreement reached at tarentum antony provided 120 ships for octavian to use against pompeius while octavian was to send 20000 legionaries to antony for use against parthia octavian sent only a tenth of those promised however which antony viewed as an intentional provocation octavian and lepidus launched a joint operation against sextus in sicily in 36bc despite setbacks for octavian the naval fleet of sextus pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 september by general agrippa at the naval battle of naulochus sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces where he was captured and executed in miletus by one of antonys generals the following year as lepidus and octavian accepted the surrender of pompeius troops lepidus attempted to claim sicily for himself ordering octavian to leave lepidus troops deserted him however and defected to octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by octavians promises of money lepidus surrendered to octavian and was permitted to retain the office of pontifex maximus head of the college of priests but was ejected from the triumvirate his public career at an end and effectively was exiled to a villa at cape circei in italy the roman dominions were now divided between octavian in the west and antony in the east octavian ensured romes citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the empire this time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of italy while also returning 30000 slaves to their former roman ownersslaves who had fled to join pompeius army and navy octavian had the senate grant him his wife and his sister tribunal immunity or sacrosanctitas in order to ensure his own safety and that of livia and octavia once he returned to rome war with antony and cleopatra meanwhile antonys campaign turned disastrous against parthia tarnishing his image as a leader and the mere 2000 legionaries sent by octavian to antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces on the other hand cleopatra could restore his army to full strength he already was engaged in a romantic affair with her so he decided to send octavia back to rome octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that antony was becoming less than roman because he rejected a legitimate roman spouse for an oriental paramour in 36bc octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end and that he would step down as triumvirif only antony would do the same antony refused roman troops captured the kingdom of armenia in 34bc and antony made his son alexander helios the ruler of armenia he also awarded the title queen of kings to cleopatra acts that octavian used to convince the roman senate that antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of rome octavian became consul once again on 1 january 33bc and he opened the following session in the senate with a vehement attack on antonys grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen the breach between antony and octavian prompted a large portion of the senators as well as both of that years consuls to leave rome and defect to antony however octavian received two key deserters from antony in the autumn of 32bc munatius plancus and marcus titius these defectors gave octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the senate all the accusations that he made against antony octavian forcibly entered the temple of the vestal virgins and seized antonys secret will which he promptly publicized the will would have given away roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule and designated alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen in late 32bc the senate officially revoked antonys powers as consul and declared war on cleopatras regime in egypt in early 31bc antony and cleopatra were temporarily stationed in greece when octavian gained a preliminary victory the navy successfully ferried troops across the adriatic sea under the command of agrippa agrippa cut off antony and cleopatras main force from their supply routes at sea while octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of corcyra modern corfu and marched south trapped on land and sea deserters of antonys army fled to octavians side daily while octavians forces were comfortable enough to make preparations antonys fleet sailed through the bay of actium on the western coast of greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade it was there that antonys fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller more maneuverable ships under commanders agrippa and gaius sosius in the battle of actium on 2 september 31bc antony and his remaining forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by cleopatras fleet that had been waiting nearby octavian pursued them and defeated their forces in alexandria on 1 august 30bcafter which antony and cleopatra committed suicide antony fell on his own sword and was taken by his soldiers back to alexandria where he died in cleopatras arms cleopatra died soon after reputedly by the venomous bite of an asp or by poison octavian had exploited his position as caesars heir to further his own political career and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do the same he therefore followed the advice of arius didymus that two caesars are one too many ordering caesarion julius caesars son by cleopatra killed while sparing cleopatras children by antony with the exception of antonys older son octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the roman people yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the battle of actium sole ruler of rome after actium and the defeat of antony and cleopatra octavian was in a position to rule the entire republic under an unofficial principatebut he had to achieve this through incremental power gains he did so by courting the senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of rome appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy marching into rome octavian and marcus agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the senate years of civil war had left rome in a state of near lawlessness but the republic was not prepared to accept the control of octavian as a despot at the same time octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the roman generals and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of rome and the roman provinces octavians aims from this point forward were to return rome to a state of stability traditional legality and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free electionsin name at least first settlement in 27 bc octavian made a show of returning full power to the roman senate and relinquishing his control of the roman provinces and their armies under his consulship however the senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike the careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage as his financial power was unrivaled in the roman republic historian werner eck states the sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the senate and people secondly from his immense private fortune and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the empire all of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions to a large extent the public were aware of the vast financial resources that octavian commanded he failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in italy in 20 bc but he undertook direct responsibility for them this was publicized on the roman currency issued in 16 bc after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium saturni the public treasury according to h h scullard however octavians power was based on the exercise of a predominant military power and the ultimate sanction of his authority was force however much the fact was disguised the senate proposed to octavian the victor of romes civil wars that he once again assume command of the provinces the senates proposal was a ratification of octavians extra-constitutional power through the senate octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional constitution feigning reluctance he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic the provinces ceded to him for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered roman world including all of hispania and gaul syria cilicia cyprus and egypt moreover command of these provinces provided octavian with control over the majority of romes legions while octavian acted as consul in rome he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out the provinces not under octavians control were overseen by governors chosen by the roman senate octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of rome and in most of its provinces but he did not have a monopoly on political and martial power the senate still controlled north africa an important regional producer of grain as well as illyria and macedonia two strategic regions with several legions however the senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls compared to the twenty legions under the control of octavian and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to octavian the senates control over some of the roman provinces helped maintain a republican faade for the autocratic principate also octavians control of entire provinces followed republican-era precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability in which such prominent romans as pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability change to augustus on 16 january 27bc the senate gave octavian the new titles of augustus and princeps augustus is from the latin word augere meaning to increase and can be translated as the illustrious one it was a title of religious authority rather than political authority his new title of augustus was also more favorable than romulus the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of the legendary founder of rome which symbolized a second founding of rome the title of romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship an image that octavian tried to avoid the title princeps senatus originally meant the member of the senate with the highest precedence but in the case of augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge augustus also styled himself as imperator caesar divi filius commander caesar son of the deified one with this title he boasted his familial link to deified julius caesar and the use of imperator signified a permanent link to the roman tradition of victory he transformed caesar a cognomen for one branch of the julian family into a new family line that began with him augustus was granted the right to hang the corona civica above his door the civic crown made from oak and to have laurels drape his doorposts however he renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter wearing a diadem or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor julius caesar if he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person the senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the curia bearing the inscription virtus pietas clementia iustitiavalor piety clemency and justice second settlement by 23bc some of the un-republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27bc augustus retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the roman political system and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the roman state further he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew marcus claudius marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the principate in his turn alienating his three greatest supporters agrippa maecenas and livia he appointed noted republican calpurnius piso as co-consul in 23bc after his choice aulus terentius varro murena who had fought against julius caesar and supported cassius and brutus was executed in consequence of his involvement in the marcus primus affair in the late spring augustus suffered a severe illness and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the principate in some form while allaying senators suspicions of his anti-republicanism augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general agrippa however augustus handed over to his co-consul piso all of his official documents an account of public finances and authority over listed troops in the provinces while augustus supposedly favored nephew marcellus came away empty-handed this was a surprise to many who believed augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded romans fearful of monarchy with regards to the principate it was obvious to augustus that marcellus was not ready to take on his position nonetheless by giving his signet ring to agrippa augustus intended to signal to the legions that agrippa was to be his successor and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding they should continue to obey agrippa soon after his bout of illness subsided augustus gave up his consulship the only other times augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2bc both times to introduce his grandsons into public life this was a clever ploy by augustus ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position while allowing augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class although augustus had resigned as consul he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire this desire as well as the marcus primus affair led to a second compromise between him and the senate known as the second settlement primary reasons for the second settlement the primary reasons for the second settlement were as follows first after augustus relinquished the annual consulship he was no longer in an official position to rule the state yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his roman imperial provinces where he was still a proconsul when he annually held the office of consul he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the senate throughout the empire when he deemed necessary a second problem later arose showing the need for the second settlement in what became known as the marcus primus affair in late 24 or early 23bc charges were brought against marcus primus the former proconsul governor of macedonia for waging a war without prior approval of the senate on the odrysian kingdom of thrace whose king was a roman ally he was defended by lucius lucinius varro murena who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from augustus ordering him to attack the client state later primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased marcellus such orders had they been given would have been considered a breach of the senates prerogative under the constitutional settlement of 27 bc and its aftermathie before augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maiusas macedonia was a senatorial province under the senates jurisdiction not an imperial province under the authority of augustus such an action would have ripped away the veneer of republican restoration as promoted by augustus and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen a first among equals even worse the involvement of marcellus provided some measure of proof that augustus policy was to have the youth take his place as princeps instituting a form of monarchy accusations that had already played out the situation was so serious that augustus himself appeared at the trial even though he had not been called as a witness under oath augustus declared that he gave no such order murena disbelieved augustus testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas he rudely demanded to know why augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called augustus replied that he came in the public interest although primus was found guilty some jurors voted to acquit meaning that not everybody believed augustus testimony an insult to the august one the second constitutional settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize augustus legal authority to intervene in senatorial provinces the senate granted augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare or proconsular imperium power that applied throughout the empire not solely to his provinces moreover the senate augmented augustus proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more maius or greater than that held by the other proconsuls this in effect gave augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire augustus stayed in rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13bc additional powers during the second settlement augustus was also granted the power of a tribune tribunicia potestas for life though not the official title of tribune for some years augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas the immunity given to a tribune of the plebs now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy renewed annually in perpetuity legally it was closed to patricians a status that augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by julius caesar this power allowed him to convene the senate and people at will and lay business before them to veto the actions of either the assembly or the senate to preside over elections and to speak first at any meeting also included in augustus tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the roman censor these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the senate with the powers of a censor augustus appealed to virtues of roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the forum there was no precedent within the roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position nor was augustus ever elected to the office of censor julius caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state however this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the senates roster the office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to augustus amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of rome itself in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life traditionally proconsuls roman province governors lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed the pomerium the sacred boundary of rome and entered the city in these situations augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul that would mean that when he was in the city he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority thanks to his prestige or auctoritas his wishes would usually be obeyed but there might be some difficulty to fill this power vacuum the senate voted that augustus imperium proconsulare maius superior proconsular power should not lapse when he was inside the city walls all armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of augustus in addition the credit was given to augustus for each subsequent roman military victory after this time because the majority of romes armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces moreover if a battle was fought in a senatorial province augustus proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of or credit for any major military victory this meant that augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph a tradition that began with romulus romes first king and first triumphant general lucius cornelius balbus was the last man outside augustus family to receive this award in 19bc tiberius augustus eldest stepson by livia was the only other general to receive a triumphfor victories in germania in 7bc conspiracy many of the political subtleties of the second settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the plebeian class who were augustus greatest supporters and clientele this caused them to insist upon augustus participation in imperial affairs from time to time augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22bc and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic senate in 22 21 and 19bc the people rioted in response and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years ostensibly to leave the other position open for augustus likewise there was a food shortage in rome in 22bc which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis after a theatrical display of refusal before the senate augustus finally accepted authority over romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium and ended the crisis almost immediately it was not until ad 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted augustus to establish a praefectus annonae a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for rome there were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to augustus by the second settlement and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of fannius caepio some time prior to 1 september 22 bc a certain castricius provided augustus with information about a conspiracy led by fannius caepio murena was named among the conspirators the outspoken consul who defended primus in the marcus primus affair the conspirators were tried in absentia with tiberius acting as prosecutor the jury found them guilty but it was not a unanimous verdict all the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were capturedwithout ever giving testimony in their defence augustus ensured that the facade of republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events in 19bc the senate granted augustus a form of general consular imperium which was probably imperium consulare maius like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 bc like his tribune authority the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold in addition augustus was allowed to wear the consuls insignia in public and before the senate as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces an emblem of consular authority this seems to have assuaged the populace regardless of whether or not augustus was a consul the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary on 6 march 12bc after the death of lepidus he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus the high priest of the college of the pontiffs the most important position in roman religion on 5 february 2bc augustus was also given the title pater patriae or father of the country stability and staying power a final reason for the second settlement was to give the principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to princeps augustus his illness of early 23 bc and the caepio conspiracy showed that the regimes existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man augustus himself who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life if he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination rome could be subjected to another round of civil war the memories of pharsalus the ides of march the proscriptions philippi and actium barely twenty-five years distant were still vivid in the minds of many citizens proconsular imperium was conferred upon agrippa for five years similar to augustus power in order to accomplish this constitutional stability the exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered augustus imperial provinces east and west perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the senate that came later as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas augustus accumulation of powers were now complete in fact he dated his reign from the completion of the second settlement 1 july 23 bc war and expansion augustus chose imperator victorious commander to be his first name since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory and consequently became known as imperator caesar divi filius augustus by the year 13 augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed imperator as his title after a successful battle almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the res gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior roman civilization with a task of ruling the world to the extent to which the romans knew it a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of augustus tu regere imperio populos romane mementoroman remember by your strength to rule the earths peoples the impulse for expansionism was apparently prominent among all classes at rome and it is accorded divine sanction by virgils jupiter in book 1 of the aeneid where jupiter promises rome imperium sine fine sovereignty without end by the end of his reign the armies of augustus had conquered northern hispania modern spain and portugal and the alpine regions of raetia and noricum modern switzerland bavaria austria slovenia illyricum and pannonia modern albania croatia hungary serbia etc and had extended the borders of the africa province to the east and south judea was added to the province of syria when augustus deposed herod archelaus successor to client king herod the great 734bc syria like egypt after antony was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of augustus again no military effort was needed in 25bc when galatia modern turkey was converted to a roman province shortly after amyntas of galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from homonada the rebellious tribes of asturias and cantabria in modern-day spain were finally quelled in 19bc and the territory fell under the provinces of hispania and lusitania this region proved to be a major asset in funding augustus future military campaigns as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in roman mining projects especially the very rich gold deposits at las medulas conquering the peoples of the alps in 16bc was another important victory for rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the roman citizens of italy and romes enemies in germania to the north horace dedicated an ode to the victory while the monument trophy of augustus near monaco was built to honor the occasion the capture of the alpine region also served the next offensive in 12bc when tiberius began the offensive against the pannonian tribes of illyricum and his brother nero claudius drusus moved against the germanic tribes of the eastern rhineland both campaigns were successful as drusus forces reached the elbe river by 9bcthough he died shortly after by falling off his horse it was recorded that the pious tiberius walked in front of his brothers body all the way back to rome to protect romes eastern territories from the parthian empire augustus relied on the client states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas that could raise their own troops for defense to ensure security of the empires eastern flank augustus stationed a roman army in syria while his skilled stepson tiberius negotiated with the parthians as romes diplomat to the east tiberius was responsible for restoring tigranes v to the throne of the kingdom of armenia yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with phraates iv of parthia 372bc in 20bc for the return of the battle standards lost by crassus in the battle of carrhae a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for rome werner eck claims that this was a great disappointment for romans seeking to avenge crassus defeat by military means however maria brosius explains that augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of parthia to rome the event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue augustus of prima porta and in monuments such as the temple of mars ultor mars the avenger built to house the standards parthia had always posed a threat to rome in the east but the real battlefront was along the rhine and danube rivers before the final fight with antony octavians campaigns against the tribes in dalmatia were the first step in expanding roman dominions to the danube victory in battle was not always a permanent success as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by romes enemies in germania a prime example of roman loss in battle was the battle of teutoburg forest in ad 9 where three entire legions led by publius quinctilius varus were destroyed by arminius leader of the cherusci an apparent roman ally augustus retaliated by dispatching tiberius and drusus to the rhineland to pacify it which had some success although the battle of ad 9 brought the end to roman expansion into germany roman general germanicus took advantage of a cherusci civil war between arminius and segestes they defeated arminius who fled that battle of idistaviso in ad 16 but was killed later in 21 due to treachery death and succession the illness of augustus in 23bc brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public to ensure stability he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in roman society and government this was to be achieved in small undramatic and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy if someone was to succeed augustus unofficial position of power he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits some augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sisters son marcellus who had been quickly married to augustus daughter julia the elder other historians dispute this due to augustus will being read aloud to the senate while he was seriously ill in 23bc instead indicating a preference for marcus agrippa who was augustus second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the empire together after the death of marcellus in 23bc augustus married his daughter to agrippa this union produced five children three sons and two daughters gaius caesar lucius caesar vipsania julia agrippina the elder and postumus agrippa so named because he was born after marcus agrippa died shortly after the second settlement agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to augustus although not trumping augustus authority his seat of governance stationed at samos in the eastern aegean this granting of power showed augustus favor for agrippa but it was also a measure to please members of his caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him augustus intent became apparent to make gaius and lucius caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children he took the consulship in 5 and 2bc so that he could personally usher them into their political careers and they were nominated for the consulships of ad 1 and 4 augustus also showed favor to his stepsons livias children from her first marriage nero claudius drusus germanicus henceforth referred to as drusus and tiberius claudius henceforth tiberius granting them military commands and public office though seeming to favor drusus after agrippa died in 12bc tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife vipsania agrippina and marry agrippas widow augustus daughter juliaas soon as a period of mourning for agrippa had ended drusus marriage to augustus niece antonia was considered an unbreakable affair whereas vipsania was only the daughter of the late agrippa from his first marriage tiberius shared in augustus tribune powers as of 6bc but shortly thereafter went into retirement reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to rhodes no specific reason is known for his departure though it could have been a combination of reasons including a failing marriage with julia as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over augustus apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons gaius and lucius gaius and lucius joined the college of priests at an early age were presented to spectators in a more favorable light and were introduced to the army in gaul after the early deaths of both lucius and gaius in ad 2 and 4 respectively and the earlier death of his brother drusus 9bc tiberius was recalled to rome in june ad 4 where he was adopted by augustus on the condition that he in turn adopt his nephew germanicus this continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs in that year tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him and by ad 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of augustus the only other possible claimant as heir was postumus agrippa who had been exiled by augustus in ad 7 his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree and augustus officially disowned him he certainly fell out of augustus favor as an heir the historian erich s gruen notes various contemporary sources that state postumus agrippa was a vulgar young man brutal and brutish and of depraved character on 19 august ad 14 augustus died while visiting nola where his father had died both tacitus and cassius dio wrote that livia was rumored to have brought about augustus death by poisoning fresh figs this element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to augustus life but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured postumus as heir or other of tiberius political enemies livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son most or all of which are unlikely to have been true alternatively it is possible that livia did supply a poisoned fig she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that augustus is said to have enjoyed but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder augustus health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power having at last reluctantly settled on tiberius as his choice of heir it is likely that augustus was not expected to return alive from nola but it seems that his health improved once there it has therefore been speculated that augustus and livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time having committed all political process to accepting tiberius in order to not endanger that transition augustus famous last words were have i played the part well then applaud as i exitreferring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor publicly though his last words were behold i found rome of clay and leave her to you of marble an enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with augustus body from nola to rome and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day tiberius and his son drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra augustus body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum it was proclaimed that augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the roman pantheon historian d c a shotter states that augustus policy of favoring the julian family line over the claudian might have afforded tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for augustus after the latters death instead tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized augustus shotter suggests that augustus deification obliged tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored coupled with tiberius extremely conservative attitude towards religion also historian r shaw-smith points to letters of augustus to tiberius which display affection towards tiberius and high regard for his military merits shotter states that tiberius focused his anger and criticism on gaius asinius gallus for marrying vipsania after augustus forced tiberius to divorce her as well as toward the two young caesars gaius and luciusinstead of augustus the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion legacy augustus reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted in one form or another for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the western roman empire and until the fall of constantinople in 1453 both his adoptive surname caesar and his title augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of the roman empire for fourteen centuries after his death in use both at old rome and at new rome in many languages caesar became the word for emperor as in the german kaiser and in the bulgarian and subsequently russian tsar sometimes csar or czar the cult of divus augustus continued until the state religion of the empire was changed to christianity in 391 by theodosius i consequently there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor he had composed an account of his achievements the res gestae divi augusti to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum copies of the text were inscribed throughout the empire upon his death the inscriptions in latin featured translations in greek beside it and were inscribed on many public edifices such as the temple in ankara dubbed the monumentum ancyranum called the queen of inscriptions by historian theodor mommsen there are a few known written works by augustus that have survived such as his poems sicily epiphanus and ajax an autobiography of 13 books a philosophical treatise and his written rebuttal to brutus eulogy of cato historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life many consider augustus to be romes greatest emperor his policies certainly extended the empires life span and initiated the celebrated pax romana or pax augusta the roman senate wished subsequent emperors to be more fortunate than augustus and better than trajan augustus was intelligent decisive and a shrewd politician but he was not perhaps as charismatic as julius caesar and was influenced on occasion by livia sometimes for the worse nevertheless his legacy proved more enduring the city of rome was utterly transformed under augustus with romes first institutionalized police force fire fighting force and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office the police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1000 men each with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors a praefectus vigilum or prefect of the watch was put in charge of the vigiles romes fire brigade and police with romes civil wars at an end augustus was also able to create a standing army for the roman empire fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170000 soldiers this was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each often recruited from recently conquered areas with his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout italy augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum besides the advent of swifter communication among italian polities his extensive building of roads throughout italy also allowed romes armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country in the year 6 augustus established the aerarium militare donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers one of the most enduring institutions of augustus was the establishment of the praetorian guard in 27bc originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in rome they had the power to intimidate the senate install new emperors and depose ones they disliked the last emperor they served was maxentius as it was constantine i who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks the castra praetoria although the most powerful individual in the roman empire augustus wished to embody the spirit of republican virtue and norms he also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people he achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess in the year 29bc augustus gave 400 sesterces equal to 110 of a roman pound of gold each to 250000 citizens 1000 sesterces each to 120000 veterans in the colonies and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon he also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the roman pantheon of deities in 28bc he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest the longevity of augustus reign and its legacy to the roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success as tacitus wrote the younger generations alive in ad 14 had never known any form of government other than the principate had augustus died earlier in 23bc for instance matters might have turned out differently the attrition of the civil wars on the old republican oligarchy and the longevity of augustus therefore must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years augustus own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts he directed the future of the empire down many lasting paths from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession to the embellishment of the capital at the emperors expense augustus ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated his memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor every emperor of rome adopted his name caesar augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title the augustan era poets virgil and horace praised augustus as a defender of rome an upholder of moral justice and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire however for his rule of rome and establishing the principate augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages the contemporary roman jurist marcus antistius labeo d ad 1011 fond of the days of pre-augustan republican liberty in which he had been born openly criticized the augustan regime in the beginning of his annals the roman historian tacitus c 56c117 wrote that augustus had cunningly subverted republican rome into a position of slavery he continued to say that with augustus death and swearing of loyalty to tiberius the people of rome simply traded one slaveholder for another tacitus however records two contradictory but common views of augustus intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways one opinion was as follows filial duty and a national emergency in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct had driven him to civil warand this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods he had made many concessions to anthony and to lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his fathers murderers when lepidus grew old and lazy and anthonys self-indulgence got the better of him the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man however augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator but by creating the principate the empires frontiers were on the ocean or distant rivers armies provinces fleets the whole system was interrelated roman citizens were protected by the law provincials were decently treated rome itself had been lavishly beautified force had been sparingly usedmerely to preserve peace for the majority according to the second opposing opinion filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts in actual fact the motive of octavian the future augustus was lust for power there had certainly been peace but it was a blood-stained peace of disasters and assassinations in a 2006 biography on augustus anthony everitt asserts that through the centuries judgments on augustus reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that opposites do not have to be mutually exclusive and we are not obliged to choose one or the other the story of his career shows that augustus was indeed ruthless cruel and ambitious for himself this was only in part a personal trait for upper-class romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel however he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism based on a nostalgia of romes antique virtues in his capacity as princeps selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind while fighting for dominance he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life he was devious untrustworthy and bloodthirsty but once he had established his authority he governed efficiently and justly generally allowed freedom of speech and promoted the rule of law he was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any democratic parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity he suffered from no delusions of grandeur tacitus was of the belief that nerva r 9698 successfully mingled two formerly alien ideas principate and liberty the 3rd-century historian cassius dio acknowledged augustus as a benign moderate ruler yet like most other historians after the death of augustus dio viewed augustus as an autocrat the poet marcus annaeus lucanus ad 3965 was of the opinion that caesars victory over pompey and the fall of cato the younger 95 bc46bc marked the end of traditional liberty in rome historian chester g starr jr writes of his avoidance of criticizing augustus perhaps augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly the anglo-irish writer jonathan swift 16671745 in his discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome criticized augustus for installing tyranny over rome and likened what he believed great britains virtuous constitutional monarchy to romes moral republic of the 2nd century bc in his criticism of augustus the admiral and historian thomas gordon 16581741 compared augustus to the puritanical tyrant oliver cromwell 15991658 thomas gordon and the french political philosopher montesquieu 16891755 both remarked that augustus was a coward in battle in his memoirs of the court of augustus the scottish scholar thomas blackwell 17011757 deemed augustus a machiavellian ruler a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper wicked and worthless a mean spirit and a tyrant revenue reforms augustus public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the empire augustus brought a far greater portion of the empires expanded land base under consistent direct taxation from rome instead of exacting varying intermittent and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as augustus predecessors had done this reform greatly increased romes net revenue from its territorial acquisitions stabilized its flow and regularized the financial relationship between rome and the provinces rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute the measures of taxation in the reign of augustus were determined by population census with fixed quotas for each province citizens of rome and italy paid indirect taxes while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces indirect taxes included a 4 tax on the price of slaves a 1 tax on goods sold at auction and a 5 tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin an equally important reform was the abolition of private tax farming which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors private contractors who collected taxes for the state were the norm in the republican era some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in rome these tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations great private wealth and the right to tax local areas the use of egypts immense land rents to finance the empires operations resulted from augustus conquest of egypt and the shift to a roman form of government as it was effectively considered augustus private property rather than a province of the empire it became part of each succeeding emperors patrimonium instead of a legate or proconsul augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming prefect of the praetorian guard the highly productive agricultural land of egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions during his reign the circus games resulted in the killing of 3500 elephants month of august the month of august latin augustus is named after augustus until his time it was called sextilis named so because it had been the sixth month of the original roman calendar and the latin word for six is sex commonly repeated lore has it that august has 31 days because augustus wanted his month to match the length of julius caesars july but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar johannes de sacrobosco sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed and it was not chosen for its length see julian calendar according to a senatus consultum quoted by macrobius sextilis was renamed to honor augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power culminating in the fall of alexandria fell in that month building projects on his deathbed augustus boasted i found a rome of bricks i leave to you one of marble although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this cassius dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the empires strength marble could be found in buildings of rome before augustus but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of augustus although this did not apply to the subura slums which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the campus martius with the ara pacis altar of peace and monumental sundial whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from egypt the relief sculptures decorating the ara pacis visually augmented the written record of augustus triumphs in the res gestae its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians the vestals and the citizenry of rome he also built the temple of caesar the baths of agrippa and the forum of augustus with its temple of mars ultor other projects were either encouraged by him such as the theatre of balbus and agrippas construction of the pantheon or funded by him in the name of others often relations eg portico of octavia theatre of marcellus even his mausoleum of augustus was built before his death to house members of his family to celebrate his victory at the battle of actium the arch of augustus was built in 29bc near the entrance of the temple of castor and pollux and widened in 19bc to include a triple-arch design after the death of agrippa in 12bc a solution had to be found in maintaining romes water supply system this came about because it was overseen by agrippa when he served as aedile and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense in that year augustus arranged a system where the senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that romes aqueducts did not fall into disrepair in the late augustan era the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum translated as supervisors of public property was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum translated as supervisors for roads for the upkeep of roads this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs the corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of augustus and the imperial phase of rome suetonius once commented that rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital yet augustus and agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of rome upon the classical greek model physical appearance and official images his biographer suetonius writing about a century after augustus death described his appearance as unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life though he cared nothing for personal adornment he was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something he had clear bright eyes his teeth were wide apart small and ill-kept his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden his eyebrows met his ears were of moderate size and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward his complexion was between dark and fair he was short of stature although julius marathus his freedman and keeper of his records says that he was five feet and nine inches just under 5 ft 7 in or 170 meters in modern height measurements but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him adding that his shoes were somewhat high-soled to make him look taller than he really was scientific analysis of traces of paint found in his official statues show that he most likely had light brown hair and eyes his hair and eyes were depicted as the same color his official images were very tightly controlled and idealized drawing from a tradition of hellenistic royal portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in roman portraiture he first appeared on coins at the age of 19 and from about
