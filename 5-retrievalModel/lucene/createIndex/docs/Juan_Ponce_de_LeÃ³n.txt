juan ponce de len spanish pronunciationxwam pone e leon 1474 july 1521 was a spanish explorer and conquistador born in santervs de campos valladolid spain in 1474 though little is known about his family he was of noble birth and served in the spanish military from a young age he first came to the americas as a gentlemen volunteer with christopher columbuss second expedition in 1493 by the early 1500s ponce de len was a top military official in the colonial government of hispaniola where he helped crush a rebellion of the native tano people he was authorized to explore the neighboring island of puerto rico in 1508 and was named the first governor of puerto rico by appointment of the spanish crown in 1509 while ponce de len grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines he faced an ongoing legal conflict with diego columbus the late christopher columbuss son over the right to govern puerto rico after a long court battle columbus replaced ponce de len as governor in 1511 ponce de len decided to follow the advice of the sympathetic king ferdinand and explore more of the caribbean sea in 1513 ponce de len led the first known european expedition to la florida which he named during his first voyage to the area he landed somewhere along floridas east coast then charted the atlantic coast down to the florida keys and north along the gulf coast perhaps as far as charlotte harbor though in popular culture he was supposedly searching for the fountain of youth there is no contemporary evidence to support the story which all modern historians call a myth ponce de len returned to spain in 1514 and was knighted by king ferdinand who also re-instated him as the governor of puerto rico and authorized him to settle florida he returned to the caribbean in 1515 but plans to organize an expedition to florida were delayed by the death of king ferdinand in 1516 after which ponce de len again traveled to spain to defend his grants and titles he would not return to puerto rico for two years in 1521 ponce de len finally returned to southwest florida with the first large-scale attempt to establish a spanish colony in what is now the continental united states however the native calusa people fiercely resisted the incursion and he was seriously wounded in a skirmish the colonization attempt was abandoned and its leader died from his wounds soon after returning to cuba ponce de len was interred in puerto rico and his tomb is located inside of the cathedral of san juan bautista in san juan spain juan ponce de len was born in the village of santervs de campos in the northern part of what is now the spanish province of valladolid although early historians placed his birth in 1460 and this date has been used traditionally more recent evidence shows he was likely born in 1474 the surname ponce de len dates from the 13th century the ponce de len lineage began with ponce vlaz de cabrera descendant of count bermudo nez and sancha ponce de cabrera daughter of ponce giraldo de cabrera before october 1235 a son of ponce vela de cabrera and his wife teresa rodrguez girn named pedro ponce de cabrera married aldonza alfonso an illegitimate daughter of king alfonso ix of len the descendants of this marriage added the de len to their patronymic and were known henceforth as the ponce de len the identity of his parents is still unknown but he appears to have been a member of a distinguished and influential noble family his relatives included rodrigo ponce de len marquis of cdiz a celebrated figure in the moorish wars ponce de len was related to another notable family the nez de guzmns and as a young man he served as squire to pedro nez de guzmn knight commander of the order of calatrava a contemporary chronicler gonzalo fernndez de oviedo y valds states that ponce de len gained his experience as a soldier fighting in the spanish campaigns that defeated the moors in granada and completed the re-conquest of spain in 1492 arrival in the new world once the war against the emirate of granada ended there was no apparent need for his military services at home so like many of his contemporaries ponce de len looked abroad for his next opportunity in september 1493 some 1200 sailors colonists and soldiers joined christopher columbus for his second voyage to the new world ponce de len was a member of this expedition one of 200 gentleman volunteers the fleet reached the caribbean in november 1493 they visited several islands before arriving at their primary destination in hispaniola in particular they anchored on the coast of a large island the natives called borinquen but would eventually become known as puerto rico this was ponce de lens first glimpse of the place that would play a major role in his future historians are divided on what he did during the next several years but it is possible that he returned to spain at some point and made his way back to hispaniola with nicols de ovando hispaniola in 1502 the newly appointed governor nicols de ovando arrived in hispaniola the spanish crown expected ovando to bring order to a colony in disarray ovando interpreted this as authorizing subjugation of the native tanos thus ovando authorized the jaragua massacre in november 1503 in 1504 when tainos overran a small spanish garrison in higey on the islands eastern side ovando assigned ponce de len to crush the rebellion ponce de len was actively involved in the higey massacre about which friar bartolom de las casas attempted to notify spanish authorities ovando rewarded his victorious commander by appointing him frontier governor of the newly conquered province then named higey also ponce de len received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient indian slave labor to farm his new estate ponce de len prospered in this new role he found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby boca de yuma where spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to spain in 1505 ovando authorized ponce de len to establish a new town in higey which he named salvalen in 1508 king ferdinand queen isabella having opposed the exploitation of natives but dying in 1504 authorized ponce de len to conquer the remaining tanos and exploit them in gold mining around this time ponce de len married leonora an innkeepers daughter they had three daughters juana isabel and maria and one son luis the large stone house ponce de len ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of salvalen de higey puerto rico as provincial governor ponce de len had occasion to meet with the tanos who visited his province from neighboring puerto rico they told him stories of a fertile land with much gold to be found in the many rivers inspired by the possibility of riches ponce de len requested and received permission from ovando to explore the island his first reconnaissance of the island is usually dated to 1508 but there is evidence that he had made a previous exploration as early as 1506 this earlier trip was done quietly because the spanish crown had commissioned vicente yez pinzn to settle the island in 1505 pinzn did not fulfill his commission and it expired in 1507 leaving the way clear for ponce de len his earlier exploration had confirmed the presence of gold and gave him a good understanding of the geography of the island in 1508 ferdinand ii of aragon gave permission to ponce de len for the first official expedition to the island which the spanish then called san juan bautista this expedition consisting of about 50 men in one ship left hispaniola on july 12 1508 and eventually anchored in san juan bay near todays city of san juan ponce de len searched inland until he found a suitable site about two miles from the bay here he erected a storehouse and a fortified house creating the first settlement in puerto rico caparra although a few crops were planted the settlers spent most of their time and energy searching for gold by early 1509 ponce de len decided to return to hispaniola his expedition had collected a good quantity of the precious metal but was running low on food and supplies the expedition was deemed a great success and ovando appointed ponce de len governor of san juan bautista this appointment was later confirmed by ferdinand ii on august 14 1509 he was instructed to extend the settlement of the island and continue mining for gold the new governor returned to the island as instructed bringing with him his wife and children back on his island ponce de len parceled out the native tanos amongst himself and other settlers using a system of forced labor known as encomienda the indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold many of the spaniards treated the tanos very harshly and newly introduced diseases like smallpox and measles took a severe toll on the local population by june 1511 the tanos were pushed to a short-lived rebellion which was forcibly put down by ponce de len and a small force of troops armed with crossbows and arquebuses even as ponce de len was settling the island of san juan significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the spanish west indies on july 10 1509 diego coln the son of christopher columbus arrived in hispaniola as acting viceroy replacing nicols de ovando for several years diego coln had been waging a legal battle over his rights to inherit the titles and privileges granted to his father the crown regretted the sweeping powers that had been granted to columbus and his heirs and sought to establish more direct control in the new world in spite of the crowns opposition coln prevailed in court and ferdinand was required to appoint him viceroy although the courts had ordered that ponce de len should remain in office coln circumvented this directive on october 28 1509 by appointing juan ceron chief justice and miguel diaz chief constable of the island effectively overriding the authority of the governor this situation prevailed until march 2 1510 when ferdinand issued orders reaffirming ponce de lens position as governor ponce de len then had ceron and diaz arrested and sent back to spain the political struggle between coln and ponce de len continued in this manner for the next few years ponce de len had influential supporters in spain and ferdinand regarded him as a loyal servant however colns position as viceroy made him a powerful opponent and eventually it became clear that ponce de lens position on san juan was not tenable finally on november 28 1511 ceron returned from spain and was officially reinstated as governor first voyage to florida rumors of undiscovered islands to the northwest of hispaniola had reached spain by 1511 and ferdinand was interested in forestalling further exploration and discovery by coln in an effort to reward ponce de len for his services ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands outside the authority of coln ponce de len readily agreed to a new venture and in february 1512 a royal contract was dispatched outlining his rights and authorities to search for the islands of benimy the contract stipulated that ponce de len held exclusive rights to the discovery of benimy and neighboring islands for the next three years he would be governor for life of any lands he discovered but he was expected to finance for himself all costs of exploration and settlement in addition the contract gave specific instructions for the distribution of gold native americans and other profits extracted from the new lands notably there was no mention of a rejuvenating fountain ponce de len equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense and set out from puerto rico on march 4 1513 the only near contemporary description known for this expedition comes from antonio de herrera y tordesillas a spanish historian who apparently had access to the original ships logs or related secondary sources from which he created a summary of the voyage published in 1601 the brevity of the account and occasional gaps in the record have led historians to speculate and dispute many details of the voyage the three ships in this small fleet were the santiago the san cristobal and the santa maria de la consolacion anton de alaminos was their chief pilot he was already an experienced sailor and would become one of the most respected pilots in the region after leaving puerto rico they sailed northwest along the great chain of bahama islands known then as the lucayos on march 27 easter sunday they sighted an island that was unfamiliar to the sailors on the expedition because many spanish seamen were acquainted with the bahamas which had been depopulated by slaving ventures some scholars believe that this island was actually florida as it was thought to be an island for several years after its formal discovery other scholars have speculated that this island was one of the northern bahama islands perhaps great abaco for the next several days the fleet crossed open water until april 2 1513 when they sighted land which ponce de len believed was another island he named it la florida in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the easter season which the spaniards called pascua florida festival of flowers the following day they came ashore to seek information and take possession of this new land the precise location of their landing on the florida coast has been disputed for many years some historians believe it occurred at or near st augustine others prefer a more southern landing at a small harbor now called ponce de len inlet but some also believe that ponce came ashore even farther south near the present location of melbourne beach a theory that has been criticized by some scholars in recent years the latitude coordinate recorded in the ships log closest to the landing site reported by herrera who had the original logbook in 1601 was 30 degrees 8 minutes this sighting was recorded at noon the day before with either a quadrant or a mariners astrolabe and the expedition sailed north for the remainder of the day before anchoring for the night and rowing ashore the following morning this latitude corresponds to a spot north of st augustine between what is now the guana tolomato matanzas national estuarine research reserve and ponte vedra beach after remaining in the area of their first landing for about five days the ships turned south for further exploration of the coast on april 8 they encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards and forced them to seek anchorage the tiniest ship the san cristobal was carried out of sight and lost for two days this was the first encounter with the gulf stream where it reaches maximum force between the florida coast and the bahamas because of the powerful boost provided by the current it would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the spanish indies bound for europe they continued down the coast hugging the shore to avoid the strong head current by may 4 the fleet reached and named biscayne bay and took on water at an island they named santa marta now key biscayne and explored the tequesta miami mound town at the mouth of the miami river the tequesta did not engage the spanish they evacuated into the coastal woodlands on may 15 they left biscayne bay and sailed along the florida keys looking for a passage to head north and explore the west coast of the florida peninsula from a distance the keys reminded ponce de len of men who were suffering so he named them los martires the martyrs eventually they found a gap in the reefs and sailed to the north and other times to the northeast until they reached the florida mainland on may 23 where they encountered the calusa who refused to trade and drove off the spanish ships by surrounding them with warriors in sea canoes armed with long bows again the exact site of their landfall is controversial the vicinity of charlotte harbor is the most commonly identified spot while some assert a landing further north at tampa bay or even pensacola other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was cape romano or cape sable here ponce de len anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships they were approached by calusa who might have been initially interested in trading but relations soon turned hostile several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides and the spaniards took eight indians captive including one to become a translator on june 4 there was another encounter with natives near sanibel island and the calusa in war canoes with the spanish sinking a fourth of them an unsubstantiated claim to justify spanish retreat on june 14 they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives they reached the dry tortugas on june 21 there they captured giant sea turtles caribbean monk seals and thousands of seabirds from these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around cuba and return home to puerto rico failing to take into account the powerful currents pushing them eastward they struck the northeast shore of cuba and were initially confused about their location once they regained their bearings the fleet retraced their route east along the florida keys and around the florida peninsula reaching grand bahama on july 8 they were surprised to come across another spanish ship piloted by diego miruelo who was either on a slaving voyage or had been sent by diego coln to spy on ponce de len shortly thereafter miruelos ship was wrecked in a storm and ponce de len rescued the stranded crew from here the little fleet disbanded ponce de len tasked the santa maria with further exploration while he returned home with the rest of crew ponce de len reached puerto rico on october 19 after having been away for almost eight months the other ship after further explorations returned safely on february 20 1514 although ponce de len is widely credited with the discovery of florida he almost certainly was not the first european to reach the peninsula spanish slave expeditions had been regularly raiding the bahamas since 1494 and there is some evidence that one or more of these slavers made it as far as the shores of florida another piece of evidence that others came before ponce de len is the cantino map from 1502 which shows a peninsula near cuba that looks like floridas and includes characteristic place names fountain of youth according to a popular legend ponce de len discovered florida while searching for the fountain of youth though stories of vitality-restoring waters were known on both sides of the atlantic long before ponce de len the story of his searching for them was not attached to him until after his death in his historia general y natural de las indias of 1535 gonzalo fernndez de oviedo y valds wrote that ponce de len was looking for the waters of bimini to cure his aging a similar account appears in francisco lpez de gmaras historia general de las indias of 1551 then in 1575 hernando de escalante fontaneda a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the native americans of florida for 17 years published his memoir in which he locates the waters in florida and says that ponce de len was supposed to have looked for them there though fontaneda doubted that ponce de len had really gone to florida looking for the waters the account was included in the historia general de los hechos de los castellanos of antonio de herrera y tordesillas of 1615 most historians hold that the search for gold and the expansion of the spanish empire were far more imperative than any potential search for such a fountain there is a possibility that the fountain of youth was an allegory for the bahamian love vine which locals brew today as an aphrodisiac ponce de len could have been seeking it as a potential entrepreneurial venture woodrow wilson believed indian servants brewing a brown tea in puerto rico may have inspired ponce de lens search for the fountain of youth arne molander has speculated that the adventurous conquistador mistook the natives vid vine for vida life transforming their fountain vine into an imagined fountain of life between voyages upon his return to puerto rico ponce de len found the island in turmoil a party of caribs from a neighboring island had attacked the settlement of caparra killed several spaniards and burned it to the ground ponce de lens own house was destroyed and his family narrowly escaped coln used the attack as a pretext for renewing hostilities against the local tano tribes the explorer suspected that coln was working to further undermine his position on the island and perhaps even to take his claims for the newly discovered florida ponce de len decided he should return to spain and personally report the results of his recent expedition he left puerto rico in april 1514 and was warmly received by ferdinand when he arrived at court in valladolid there he was knighted and given a personal coat of arms becoming the first conquistador to receive these honors he also visited casa de contratacin in seville which was the central bureaucracy and clearinghouse for all of spains activities in the new world the casa took detailed notes of his discoveries and added them to the padrn real a master map which served as the basis for official navigation charts provided to spanish captains and pilots during his stay in spain a new contract was drawn up for ponce de len confirming his rights to settle and govern bimini and florida which was then presumed to be an island in addition to the usual directions for sharing gold and other valuables with the king the contract was one of the first to stipulate that the requerimiento was to be read to the inhabitants of the islands prior to their conquest ponce de len was also ordered to organize an armada for the purpose of attacking and subduing the caribs who continued to attack spanish settlements in the caribbean three ships were purchased for his armada and after repairs and provisioning ponce de len left spain on may 14 1515 with his little fleet the record of his activities against the caribs is vague there was one engagement in guadeloupe on his return to the area and possibly two or three other encounters the campaign came to an abrupt end in 1516 when ferdinand died the king had been a strong supporter and ponce de len felt it was imperative he return to spain and defend his privileges and titles he did receive assurances of support from cardinal francisco jimnez de cisneros the regent appointed to govern castile but it was nearly two years before he was able to return home to puerto rico meanwhile there had been at least two unauthorized voyages to his florida both ending in repulsion by the native calusa tequesta warriors ponce de len realized he had to act soon if he was to maintain his claim last voyage to florida in early 1521 ponce de len organized a colonizing expedition consisting of some 200 men including priests farmers and artisans 50 horses and other domestic animals and farming implements carried on two ships the expedition landed somewhere on the coast of southwest florida likely in the vicinity of charlotte harbor or the caloosahatchee river areas which ponce de len had visited in his earlier voyage to florida before the settlement could be established the colonists were attacked by the calusa the indigenous people who dominated southern florida and whose principal town was nearby ponce de len was mortally wounded in the skirmish when historians believe an arrow poisoned with the sap of the manchineel tree struck his thigh the expedition immediately abandoned the colonization attempt and sailed to havana cuba where ponce de len soon died of his wounds he was buried in puerto rico in the crypt of san jos church from 1559 to 1836 when his remains were exhumed and transferred to the cathedral of san juan bautista see also puerto rico portal new spain portal juan ponce de len ii juan ponce de len y loayza ageyban the
