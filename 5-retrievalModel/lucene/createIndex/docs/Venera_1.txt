venera 1 russian -1 meaning venus 1 also known as venera-1va no2 and occasionally in the west as sputnik 8 was the first spacecraft to fly past venus as part of the soviet unions venera programme launched in february 1961 it flew past venus on 19 may of the same year however radio contact with the probe was lost before the flyby resulting in it returning no data spacecraft venera 1 was a 6435-kilogram 1419lb probe consisting of a cylindrical body 105 metres 3ft 5in in diameter topped by a dome totalling 2035 metres 6ft 81in in height this was pressurized to 12 standard atmospheres 120kpa with dry nitrogen with internal fans to maintain even distribution of heat two solar panels extended from the cylinder charging a bank of silver-zinc batteries a 2-metre parabolic wire-mesh antenna was designed to send data from venus to earth on a frequency of 9228mhz a 24-metre antenna boom was used to transmit short-wave signals during the near-earth phase of the mission semidirectional quadrupole antennas mounted on the solar panels provided routine telemetry and telecommand contact with earth during the mission on a circularly-polarized decimetre radio band the probe was equipped with scientific instruments including a flux-gate magnetometer attached to the antenna boom two ion traps to measure solar wind micrometeorite detectors and geiger counter tubes and a sodium iodide scintillator for measurement of cosmic radiation an experiment attached to one solar panel measured temperatures of experimental coatings infrared andor ultraviolet radiometers may have been included the dome contained a kdu-414 engine used for mid-course corrections temperature control was achieved by motorized thermal shutters during most of its flight venera 1 was spin stabilized it was the first spacecraft designed to perform mid-course corrections by entering a mode of 3-axis stabilization fixing on the sun and the star canopus had it reached venus it would have entered another mode of 3-axis stabilization fixing on the sun and earth and using for the first time a parabolic antenna to relay data launch venera 1 was the second of two attempts to launch a probe to venus in february 1961 immediately following the launch of its sister ship venera-1va no1 which failed to leave earth orbit soviet experts launched venera-1 using a molniya carrier rocket from the baikonur cosmodrome the launch took place at 003436 utc on 12 february 1961 the spacecraft along with the rockets blok-l upper stage were initially placed into a 229 282km low earth orbit before the upper stage fired to place venera 1 into a heliocentric orbit directed towards venus the 11d33 engine was the worlds first staged-combustion-cycle rocket engine and also the first use of an ullage engine to allow a liquid-fuel rocket engine to start in space failure three successful telemetry sessions were conducted gathering solar-wind and cosmic-ray data near earth at the earths magnetopause and on february 19 at a distance of 1900000km 1200000mi after discovering the solar wind with luna 2 venera 1 provided the first verification that this plasma was uniformly present in deep space seven days later the next scheduled telemetry session failed to occur on may 19 1961 venera 1 passed within 100000km 62000mi of venus with the help of the british radio telescope at jodrell bank some weak signals from venera 1 may have been detected in june soviet engineers believed that venera-1 failed due to the overheating of a solar-direction sensor see also spaceflight portal list of missions to venus mariner 2 timeline of planetary exploration venera the soviet exploration of venus nssdc master catalog - venera 1
