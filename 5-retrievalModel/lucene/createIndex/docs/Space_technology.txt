space technology is technology developed by space science or the aerospace industry for use in spaceflight satellites or space exploration space technology includes spacecraft satellites space stations and support infrastructure equipment and procedures space is such a novel environment that attempting to work in it requires new tools and techniques many common everyday services such as weather forecasting remote sensing gps systems satellite television and some long distance communications systems critically rely on space infrastructure of the sciences astronomy and earth science via remote sensing benefit from space technology new technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavours are often subsequently exploited in other economic activities types of space technologies satellite technology satellite types of satellites communications satellite direct-broadcast satellite earth observation satellite geosynchronous satellite military satellite reconnaissance satellite navigation satellite tracking and data relay satellite weather satellite specific satellites list of earth observation satellites list of satellites in geosynchronous orbit list of satellites which have provided data on earths magnetosphere types of satellites communications satellite direct-broadcast satellite earth observation satellite geosynchronous satellite military satellite reconnaissance satellite navigation satellite tracking and data relay satellite weather satellite communications satellite direct-broadcast satellite direct-broadcast satellite earth observation satellite geosynchronous satellite military satellite reconnaissance satellite reconnaissance satellite navigation satellite tracking and data relay satellite weather satellite specific satellites list of earth observation satellites list of satellites in geosynchronous orbit list of satellites which have provided data on earths magnetosphere list of earth observation satellites list of satellites in geosynchronous orbit list of satellites which have provided data on earths magnetosphere satellite orbit artificial satellites in retrograde orbit artificial satellites in retrograde orbit satellite-based services satellite navigation satellite radio satellite television satellite navigation satellite radio satellite television space exploration technology aerobot planetary probe suspended in atmosphere lunar rover mars rover manned space mission space flight technology spaceflight ablative heat shield aerobraking booster rocketry gantry reusable launch systemthe space shuttle and x-37 are partially reusable spaceplanes spacex is currently developing a set of reusable technologies to support booster reuse and second-stage reuse history of space technology history of satellite technology timeline of artificial satellites and space probes timeline of earth science satellites timeline of artificial satellites and space probes timeline of earth science satellites timeline of earth science satellites future space technologies asteroid mining single-stage-to-orbit space-based solar power non-rocket spacelaunch space manufacturing see also spaceflight portal outline of space exploration outline of space science newspace definitions from wiktionary media from wikimedia commons news from wikinews quotations from wikiquote texts from wikisource textbooks from wikibooks resources from wikiversity nasa images and videos of space technology
