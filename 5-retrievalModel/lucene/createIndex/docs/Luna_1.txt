luna 1 also known as mechta russian mtta lit dream e-1 no4 and first lunar rover was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the earths moon and the first spacecraft to be placed in heliocentric orbit intended as an impactor luna 1 was launched as part of the soviet luna programme in 1959 however due to an incorrectly timed upper stage burn during its launch it missed the moon in the process becoming the first spacecraft to leave geocentric orbit while traveling through the outer van allen radiation belt the spacecrafts scintillator made observations indicating that a small number of high-energy particles exist in the outer belt the measurements obtained during this mission provided new data on the earths radiation belt and outer space the moon was found to have no detectable magnetic field the first-ever direct observations and measurements of the solar wind a strong flow of ionized plasma emanating from the sun and streaming through interplanetary space were performed that ionized plasma concentration was measured to be some 700 particles per cm at altitudes 2025 thousand km and 300 to 400 particles per cm at altitudes 100150000km the spacecraft also marked the first instance of radio communication at the half-million-kilometer distance a malfunction in the ground-based control system caused an error in the rockets burntime and the spacecraft missed the target and flew by the moon at a distance of 5900km at the closest point luna 1 then became the first man-made object to reach heliocentric orbit and was then dubbed a new planet and renamed mechta dream luna 1 was also referred to as the first cosmic rocket in reference to its achievement of escape velocity spacecraft luna 1 contained radio equipment including a tracking transmitter and telemetry system and five instruments to study the moon and interplanetary space including a magnetometer geiger counter scintillation counter and micrometeorite detector luna 1 was designed to impact the moon delivering two metallic pennants with the soviet coat of arms that were included into its package this mission was eventually accomplished by luna 2 launch luna 1 was launched at 1641 gmt 2241 local time on 2 january 1959 from site 15 at the baikonur cosmodrome by a luna 8k72 rocket luna 1 became the first man-made object to reach the escape velocity of the earth along with its carrier rockets 1472-kilogram 3245lb upper stage which it separated from after achieving heliocentric orbit due to a programming error the duration of the upper stages burn was incorrect and consequently luna 1 failed to impact the moon the spacecraft passed within 5995 kilometres 3725mi of the moons surface on 4 january after 34 hours of flight it remains in orbit around the sun between the orbits of earth and mars sodium release experiment at 005620 utc on 3 january at a distance of 119500 kilometres 74300mi from earth 1 kilogram 22lb of sodium gas was released by the spacecraft forming a cloud behind it to serve as an artificial comet this glowing orange trail of gas visible over the indian ocean with the brightness of a sixth-magnitude star for a few minutes was photographed by mstislav gnevyshev at the mountain station of the main astronomical observatory of the academy of sciences of the ussr near kislovodsk it served as an experiment on the behavior of gas in outer space a wired press photograph entitled rockets russian rocket sent into outer space january 1959 first rocket fired at moon describes how the sodium gas cloud was photographed by morris alan the following text is taken verbatim from the reverse of a press photograph stamped kemsley newspapers 6 jan 1959 the russian rocket on its way to the moon mr morris alan 34 year old freelance photographer who was the first man to photograph the original russian sputnik early this morning took this photograph of the moon rocket he and his three assistants saw the rocket from kingscat hill near dunfermline firthshire just after 1 am and held it in view for almost eight minutes it appeared like a cloud on the horizon near the constellation virgo he said we photographed it with three cameras and with a movie camera its emerged in the sky just over the horizon near edinburgh but it was a second or two before we realised what we had the picture shows the lights of edinburgh in the foreground the rocket is seen as an illuminated cloud top centre malfunction luna 1 was meant to crash on the moon however due to a malfunction of the ground control system the probe missed its target by 5995 kilometers despite this luna 1 still managed to collect vital information to assist in the understanding of the universe its goal to crash on the moon was subsequently achieved by luna 2 on september
