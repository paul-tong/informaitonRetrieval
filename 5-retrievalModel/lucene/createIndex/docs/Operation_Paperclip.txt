operation paperclip was a secret program of the joint intelligence objectives agency jioa largely carried out by special agents of army cic in which more than 1600 german scientists engineers and technicians such as wernher von braun and his v-2 rocket team were taken from germany to america for us government employment primarily between 1945 and 1959 many were former members and some were former leaders of the nazi party the primary purpose for operation paperclip was us military advantage in the sovietamerican cold war and the space race the soviet union was more aggressive in forcibly recruiting more than 2200 german specialistsa total of more than 6000 people including family memberswith operation osoaviakhim during one night on october 22 1946 the joint chiefs of staff jcs established the first secret recruitment program called operation overcast on july 20 1945 initially to assist in shortening the japanese war and to aid our postwar military research the term overcast was the name first given by the german scientists family members for the housing camp where they were held in bavaria in late summer 1945 the jcs established the jioa a subcommittee of the joint intelligence community to directly oversee operation overcast and later operation paperclip the jioa representatives included the armys director of intelligence the chief of naval intelligence the assistant chief of air staff-2 air force intelligence and a representative from the state department in november 1945 operation overcast was renamed operation paperclip by ordnance corps united states army officers who would attach a paperclip to the folders of those rocket experts whom they wished to employ in america in a secret directive circulated on september 3 1946 president truman officially approved operation paperclip and expanded it to include one thousand german scientists under temporary limited military custody osenberg list in the later part of world war ii nazi germany found itself at a logistical disadvantage having failed to conquer the ussr with operation barbarossa junedecember 1941 the siege of leningrad september 1941 january 1944 operation nordlicht northern light augustoctober 1942 and the battle of stalingrad july 1942 february 1943 the failed conquest had depleted german resources and its military-industrial complex was unprepared to defend the grodeutsches reich greater german reich against the red armys westward counterattack by early 1943 the german government began recalling from combat a number of scientists engineers and technicians they returned to work in research and development to bolster german defense for a protracted war with the ussr the recall from frontline combat included 4000 rocketeers returned to peenemnde in northeast coastal germany overnight phds were liberated from kp duty masters of science were recalled from orderly service mathematicians were hauled out of bakeries and precision mechanics ceased to be truck drivers the nazi governments recall of their now-useful intellectuals for scientific work first required identifying and locating the scientists engineers and technicians then ascertaining their political and ideological reliability werner osenberg the engineer-scientist heading the wehrforschungsgemeinschaft defense research association recorded the names of the politically cleared men to the osenberg list thus reinstating them to scientific work in march 1945 at bonn university a polish laboratory technician found pieces of the osenberg list stuffed in a toilet the list subsequently reached mi6 who transmitted it to us intelligence then us army major robert b staver chief of the jet propulsion section of the research and intelligence branch of the us army ordnance corps used the osenberg list to compile his list of german scientists to be captured and interrogated wernher von braun germanys premier rocket scientist headed major stavers list identification in operation overcast major stavers original intent was only to interview the scientists but what he learned changed the operations purpose on may 22 1945 he transmitted to the us pentagon headquarters colonel joel holmess telegram urging the evacuation of german scientists and their families as most important for the pacific war effort most of the osenberg list engineers worked at the baltic coast german army research center peenemnde developing the v-2 rocket after capturing them the allies initially housed them and their families in landshut bavaria in southern germany beginning on july 19 1945 the us jcs managed the captured arc rocketeers under operation overcast however when the camp overcast name of the scientists quarters became locally known the program was renamed operation paperclip in november 1945 despite these attempts at secrecy later that year the press interviewed several of the scientists capture and detention early on the united states created the combined intelligence objectives subcommittee cios this provided the information on targets for the t-forces that went in and targeted scientific military and industrial installations and their employees for their know-how initial priorities were advanced technology such as infrared that could be used in the war against japan finding out what technology had been passed on to japan and finally to halt the research a project to halt the research was codenamed project safehaven and it was not initially targeted against the soviet union rather the concern was that german scientists might emigrate and continue their research in countries such as spain argentina or egypt all of which had sympathized with nazi germany in order to avoid the complications involved with the emigration of german scientists the cios was responsible for scouting and kidnapping high-profile individuals for the deprivation of technological advancements in nations outside of the us much us effort was focused on saxony and thuringia which by july 1 1945 would become part of the soviet occupation zone many german research facilities and personnel had been evacuated to these states particularly from the berlin area fearing that the soviet takeover would limit us ability to exploit german scientific and technical expertise and not wanting the soviet union to benefit from said expertise the united states instigated an evacuation operation of scientific personnel from saxony and thuringia issuing orders such as on orders of military government you are to report with your family and baggage as much as you can carry tomorrow noon at 1300 hours friday 22 june 1945 at the town square in bitterfeld there is no need to bring winter clothing easily carried possessions such as family documents jewelry and the like should be taken along you will be transported by motor vehicle to the nearest railway station from there you will travel on to the west please tell the bearer of this letter how large your family is by 1947 this evacuation operation had netted an estimated 1800 technicians and scientists along with 3700 family members those with special skills or knowledge were taken to detention and interrogation centers such as one code-named dustbin to be held and interrogated in some cases for months a few of the scientists were gathered up in operation overcast but most were transported to villages in the countryside where there were neither research facilities nor work they were provided stipends and forced to report twice weekly to police headquarters to prevent them from leaving the joint chiefs of staff directive on research and teaching stated that technicians and scientists should be released only after all interested agencies were satisfied that all desired intelligence information had been obtained from them on november 5 1947 the office of military government of the united states omgus which had jurisdiction over the western part of occupied germany held a conference to consider the status of the evacuees the monetary claims that the evacuees had filed against the united states and the possible violation by the us of laws of war or rules of land warfare the omgus director of intelligence r l walsh initiated a program to resettle the evacuees in the third world which the germans referred to as general walshs urwald-programm jungle program however this program never matured in 1948 the evacuees received settlements of 695 million reichsmarks from the us a settlement that soon became severely devalued during the currency reform that introduced the deutsche mark as the official currency of western germany john gimbel concludes that the united states held some of germanys best minds for three years therefore depriving the german recovery of their expertise arrivals in may 1945 the us navy received in custody dr herbert a wagner the inventor of the hs 293 missile for two years he first worked at the special devices center at castle gould and at hempstead house long island new york in 1947 he moved to the naval air station point mugu in august 1945 colonel holger toftoy head of the rocket branch of the research and development division of the us armys ordnance corps offered initial one-year contracts to the rocket scientists 127 of them accepted in september 1945 the first group of seven rocket scientists aerospace engineers arrived at fort strong located on long island in boston harbor wernher von braun erich w neubert theodor a poppel august schulze eberhard rees wilhelm jungert and walter schwidetzky beginning in late 1945 three rocket-scientist groups arrived in the united states for duty at fort bliss texas and at white sands proving grounds new mexico as war department special employees in 1946 the united states bureau of mines employed seven german synthetic fuel scientists at a fischer-tropsch chemical plant in louisiana missouri on june 1 1949 the chief of ordnance of the united states army designated redstone arsenal in huntsville alabama as the ordnance rocket center its facility for rocket research and development on april 1 1950 the fort bliss missile development operationincluding von braun and his team of over 130 paperclip memberswas transferred to redstone arsenal in early 1950 legal us residency for some of the project paperclip specialists was effected through the us consulate in ciudad jurez chihuahua mexico thus german scientists legally entered the united states from latin america between 1945 and 1952 the united states air force sponsored the largest number of paperclip scientists importing 260 men of whom 36 returned to germany and one walter schreiber reemigrated to argentina eighty-six aeronautical engineers were transferred to wright field ohio where the united states had luftwaffe aircraft and equipment captured under operation lusty luftwaffe secret technology the united states army signal corps employed 24 specialists including the physicists georg goubau gunter guttwein georg hass horst kedesdy and kurt lehovec the physical chemists rudolf brill ernst baars and eberhard both the geophysicist helmut weickmann the optician gerhard schwesinger and the engineers eduard gerber richard guenther and hans ziegler in 1959 94 operation paperclip men went to the united states including friedwardt winterberg and friedrich wigand overall through its operations to 1990 operation paperclip imported 1600 men as part of the intellectual reparations owed to the united states and the uk valued at 10 billion in patents and industrial processes major

von braun scientific accomplishments wernher von braun was chief architect of the saturn v launch vehicle the key instrument in getting man to the moon adolf busemann was the mind behind the swept wing which improved aircraft performance at high speeds controversy and investigations before his official approval of the program president truman for sixteen months was indecisive on the program years later in 1963 truman recalled that he was not in the least reluctant to approve paperclip that because of relations with russia this had to be done and was done several of the paperclip scientists were later investigated because of their links with the nazi party during the war only one paperclip scientist georg rickhey was formally tried for any crime and no paperclip scientist was found guilty of any crime in america or germany in 1947 georg rickhey who came to the united states under operation paperclip in 1946 was returned to germany to stand trial at the dora trial where he was acquitted in 1951 weeks after his us arrival walter schreiber was linked by the boston globe to human experiments conducted by kurt blome at ravensbrck and he emigrated to argentina with the aid of the us military in 1984 arthur rudolph under perceived threat of prosecution relating to his connectionas operations director for v-2 missile productionto the use of forced labor from mittelbau-dora at the mittelwerk renounced his us citizenship and moved to west germany which granted him citizenship for fifty years from 1963 to 2013 the strughold awardnamed after hubertus
