jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in the solar system it is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the sun but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the solar system combined jupiter and saturn are gas giants the other two giant planets uranus and neptune are ice giants jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity it is named after the roman god jupiter when viewed from earth jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 294 bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows and making it on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the moon and venus jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements but like the other giant planets jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface because of its rapid rotation the planets shape is that of an oblate spheroid it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator the outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries a prominent result is the great red spot a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope surrounding jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere jupiter has 79 known moons including the four large galilean moons discovered by galileo galilei in 1610 ganymede the largest of these has a diameter greater than that of the planet mercury jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft most notably during the early pioneer and voyager flyby missions and later by the galileo orbiter in late february 2007 jupiter was visited by the new horizons probe which used jupiters gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to pluto the latest probe to visit the planet is juno which entered into orbit around jupiter on july 4 2016 future targets for exploration in the jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon europa formation and migration astronomers have discovered nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several times greater than earths super-earths orbiting closer to their star than mercury is to the sun and sometimes also jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star earth and its neighbor planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with jupiter destroyed those super-earths near the sun as jupiter came toward the inner solar system in what theorists call the grand tack hypothesis gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing a series of collisions between the super-earths as their orbits began to overlap jupiter moving out of the inner solar system would have allowed the formation of inner planets including earth physical characteristics jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter it is the largest of the four giant planets in the solar system and hence its largest planet it has a diameter of 142984km 88846mi at its equator the average density of jupiter 1326gcm is the second highest of the giant planets but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets composition jupiters upper atmosphere is about 8892 hydrogen and 812 helium by percent volume of gas molecules a helium atom has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom so the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms thus jupiters atmosphere is approximately 75 hydrogen and 24 helium by mass with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements the atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane water vapor ammonia and silicon-based compounds there are also traces of carbon ethane hydrogen sulfide neon oxygen phosphine and sulfur the outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia the interior contains denser materialsby mass it is roughly 71 hydrogen 24 helium and 5 other elements through infrared and ultraviolet measurements trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found the atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass which is about a tenth as abundant as in the sun helium is also depleted to about 80 of the suns helium composition this depletion is a result of precipitation of these elements into the interior of the planet based on spectroscopy saturn is thought to be similar in composition to jupiter but the other giant planets uranus and neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants mass and size jupiters mass is 25 times that of all the other planets in the solar system combinedthis is so massive that its barycenter with the sun lies above the suns surface at 1068solar radii from the suns center jupiter is much larger than earth and considerably less dense its volume is that of about 1321 earths but it is only 318 times as massive jupiters radius is about 110 the radius of the sun and its mass is 0001 times the mass of the sun so the densities of the two bodies are similar a jupiter mass mj or mjup is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs so for example the extrasolar planet hd 209458 b has a mass of 069mj while kappa andromedae b has a mass of 128mj theoretical models indicate that if jupiter had much more mass than it does at present it would shrink for small changes in mass the radius would not change appreciably and above about 500m 16 jupiter masses the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased pressure that its volume would decrease despite the increasing amount of matter as a result jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve the process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved as in high-mass brown dwarfs having around 50 jupiter masses although jupiter would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than jupiter despite this jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the sun the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives this additional heat is generated by the kelvinhelmholtz mechanism through contraction this process causes jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year when it was first formed jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter internal structure jupiter is thought to consist of a dense core with a mixture of elements a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen beyond this basic outline there is still considerable uncertainty the core is often described as rocky but its detailed composition is unknown as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths see below in 1997 the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of earth or roughly 414 of the total mass of jupiter the presence of a core during at least part of jupiters history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula assuming it did exist it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior a core may now be entirely absent as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely the uncertainty of the models is tied to the error margin in hitherto measured parameters one of the rotational coefficients j6 used to describe the planets gravitational moment jupiters equatorial radius and its temperature at 1 bar pressure the juno mission which arrived in july 2016 is expected to further constrain the values of these parameters for better models of the core the core region may be surrounded by dense metallic hydrogen which extends outward to about 78 of the radius of the planet rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on jupiter as well as on saturn and ice giants uranus and neptune above the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen at this depth the pressure and temperature are above hydrogens critical pressure of 12858 mpa and critical temperature of only 32938k in this state there are no distinct liquid and gas phaseshydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state it is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1000km and as liquid in deeper layers physically there is no clear boundarythe gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends the temperature and pressure inside jupiter increase steadily toward the core due to the kelvinhelmholtz mechanism at the pressure level of 10bars 1 mpa the temperature is around 340k 67c 152f at the phase transition region where hydrogenheated beyond its critical pointbecomes metallic it is calculated the temperature is 10000k 9700c 17500f and the pressure is 200gpa the temperature at the core boundary is estimated to be 36000k 35700c 64300f and the interior pressure is roughly 30004500gpa atmosphere jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the solar system spanning over 5000km 3000mi in altitude because jupiter has no surface the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to 100kpa 10bar cloud layers jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide the clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes known as tropical regions these are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts the interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence wind speeds of 100ms 360kmh are common in zonal jets the zones have been observed to vary in width color and intensity from year to year but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations the cloud layer is only about 50km 31mi deep and consists of at least two decks of clouds a thick lower deck and a thin clearer region there may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer supporting the idea of water clouds are the flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of jupiter these electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on earth the water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior the orange and brown coloration in the clouds of jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the sun the exact makeup remains uncertain but the substances are thought to be phosphorus sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons these colorful compounds known as chromophores mix with the warmer lower deck of clouds the zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view jupiters low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planets equatorial region convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer great red spot and other vortices the best known feature of jupiter is the great red spot a persistent anticyclonic storm that is larger than earth located 22 south of the equator it is known to have been in existence since at least 1831 and possibly since 1665 images by the hubble space telescope have shown as many as two red spots adjacent to the great red spot the storm is large enough to be visible through earth-based telescopes with an aperture of 12cm or larger the oval object rotates counterclockwise with a period of about six days the maximum altitude of this storm is about 8km 5mi above the surrounding cloudtops the great red spot is large enough to accommodate earth within its boundaries mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet however it has significantly decreased in size since its discovery initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41000km 25500mi across by the time of the voyager flybys in 1979 the storm had a length of 23300km 14500mi and a width of approximately 13000km 8000mi hubble observations in 1995 showed it had decreased in size again to 20950km 13020mi and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17910km 11130mi as of 2015 the storm was measured at approximately 16500 by 10940km 10250 by 6800mi and is decreasing in length by about 930km 580mi per year storms such as this are common within the turbulent atmospheres of giant planets jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals which are lesser unnamed storms white ovals tend to consist of relatively cool clouds within the upper atmosphere brown ovals are warmer and located within the normal cloud layer such storms can last as little as a few hours or stretch on for centuries even before voyager proved that the feature was a storm there was strong evidence that the spot could not be associated with any deeper feature on the planets surface as the spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly in 2000 an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the great red spot but smaller this was created when several smaller white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single featurethese three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938 the merged feature was named oval ba and has been nicknamed red spot junior it has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red in april 2017 scientists reported the discovery of a great cold spot in jupiters thermosphere at its north pole that is 24000km 15000mi across 12000km 7500mi wide and 200c 360f cooler than surrounding material the feature was discovered by researchers at the very large telescope in chile who then searched archived data from the nasa infrared telescope facility between 1995 and 2000 they found that while the spot changes size shape and intensity over the short term it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere across more than 15 years of available data scientists believe the spot is a giant vortex similar to the great red spot and also appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in earths thermosphere interactions between charged particles generated from io and the planets strong magnetic field likely resulted in redistribution of heat flow forming the spot magnetosphere jupiters magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of earth ranging from 42gauss 042 mt at the equator to 1014 gauss 1014 mt at the poles making it the strongest in the solar system except for sunspots this field is thought to be generated by eddy currentsswirling movements of conducting materialswithin the liquid metallic hydrogen core the volcanoes on the moon io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moons orbit the gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions they together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of jupiter form a plasma sheet in jupiters equatorial plane the plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of magnetodisk electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0630mhz at about 75 jupiter radii from the planet the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock surrounding jupiters magnetosphere is a magnetopause located at the inner edge of a magnetosheatha region between it and the bow shock the solar wind interacts with these regions elongating the magnetosphere on jupiters lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of saturn the four largest moons of jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere which protects them from the solar wind the magnetosphere of jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planets polar regions volcanic activity on jupiters moon io see below injects gas into jupiters magnetosphere producing a torus of particles about the planet as io moves through this torus the interaction generates alfvn waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of jupiter as a result radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface when earth intersects this cone the radio emissions from jupiter can exceed the solar radio output orbit and rotation jupiter is the only planet whose barycenter with the sun lies outside the volume of the sun though by only 7 of the suns radius the average distance between jupiter and the sun is 778 millionkm about 52 times the average distance between earth and the sun or 52 au and it completes an orbit every 1186years this is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of saturn forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the solar system the elliptical orbit of jupiter is inclined 131 compared to earth because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0048 jupiters distance from the sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach perihelion and furthest distance aphelion the axial tilt of jupiter is relatively small only 313 as a result it does not experience significant seasonal changes in contrast to for example earth and mars jupiters rotation is the fastest of all the solar systems planets completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an earth-based amateur telescope the planet is shaped as an oblate spheroid meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles on jupiter the equatorial diameter is 9275km 5763mi longer than the diameter measured through the poles because jupiter is not a solid body its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation the rotation of jupiters polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere three systems are used as frames of reference particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features system i applies from the latitudes 10n to 10s its period is the planets shortest at 9h 50m 300s system ii applies at all latitudes north and south of these its period is 9h 55m 406s system iii was first defined by radio astronomers and corresponds to the rotation of the planets magnetosphere its period is jupiters official rotation observation jupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky after the sun the moon and venus at times mars appears brighter than jupiter depending on jupiters position with respect to the earth it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as 294 at opposition down to 166 during conjunction with the sun the mean apparent magnitude is -220 with a standard deviation of 033 the angular diameter of jupiter likewise varies from 501 to 298 arc seconds favorable oppositions occur when jupiter is passing through perihelion an event that occurs once per orbit earth overtakes jupiter every 3989 days as it orbits the sun a duration called the synodic period as it does so jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion with respect to the background stars that is for a period jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky performing a looping motion because the orbit of jupiter is outside that of earth the phase angle of jupiter as viewed from earth never exceeds 115 that is the planet always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through earth-based telescopes it was only during spacecraft missions to jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained a small telescope will usually show jupiters four galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across jupiters atmosphere a large telescope will show jupiters great red spot when it faces earth mythology the planet jupiter has been known since ancient times it is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the sun is low to the babylonians this object represented their god marduk they used jupiters roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac the romans called it the star of jupiter iuppiter stella as they believed it to be sacred to the principal god of roman mythology whose name comes from the proto-indo-european vocative compound dyu-pter nominative dyus-ptr meaning father sky-god or father day-god in turn jupiter was the counterpart to the mythical greek zeus also referred to as dias the planetary name of which is retained in modern greek the ancient greeks knew the planet as phaethon meaning shining one or blazing star as supreme god of the roman pantheon jupiter was the god of thunder lightning and storms and appropriately called the god of light and sky the astronomical symbol for the planet is a stylized representation of the gods lightning bolt the original greek deity zeus supplies the root zeno- used to form some jupiter-related words such as zenographic jovian is the adjectival form of jupiter the older adjectival form jovial employed by astrologers in the middle ages has come to mean happy or merry moods ascribed to jupiters astrological influence the chinese vietnamese koreans and japanese called it the wood star chinese pinyin mxng based on the chinese five elements chinese taoism personified it as the fu star the greeks called it phaethon meaning blazing in vedic astrology hindu astrologers named the planet after brihaspati the religious teacher of the gods and often called it guru which literally means the heavy one in germanic mythology jupiter is equated to thor whence the english name thursday for the roman dies jovis in the central asian-turkic myths jupiter is called erendiz or erentz from eren of uncertain meaning and yultuz star there are many theories about the meaning of eren these peoples calculated the period of the orbit of jupiter as 11 years and 300 days they believed that some social and natural events connected to erentzs movements on the sky history of research and exploration pre-telescopic research the observation of jupiter dates back to at least the babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century bc the ancient chinese also observed the orbit of suxng and established their cycle of 12 earthly branches based on its approximate number of years the chinese language still uses its name simplified as when referring to years of age by the 4th century bc these observations had developed into the chinese zodiac with each year associated with a tai sui star and god controlling the region of the heavens opposite jupiters position in the night sky these beliefs survive in some taoist religious practices and in the east asian zodiacs twelve animals now often popularly assumed to be related to the arrival of the animals before buddha the chinese historian xi zezong has claimed that gan de an ancient chinese astronomer discovered one of jupiters moons in 362bc with the unaided eye if accurate this would predate galileos discovery by nearly two millennia in his 2nd century work the almagest the hellenistic astronomer claudius ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain jupiters motion relative to earth giving its orbital period around earth as 433238days or 1186years ground-based telescope research in 1610 italian polymath galileo galilei discovered the four largest moons of jupiter now known as the galilean moons using a telescope thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than earths one day after galileo simon marius independently discovered moons around jupiter though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614 it was mariuss names for the four major moons however that stuckio europa ganymede and callisto these findings were also the first discovery of celestial motion not apparently centered on earth the discovery was a major point in favor of copernicus heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets galileos outspoken support of the copernican theory placed him under the threat of the inquisition during the 1660s giovanni cassini used a new telescope to discover spots and colorful bands on jupiter and observed that the planet appeared oblate that is flattened at the poles he was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet in 1690 cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation the great red spot a prominent oval-shaped feature in the southern hemisphere of jupiter may have been observed as early as 1664 by robert hooke and in 1665 by cassini although this is disputed the pharmacist heinrich schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the great red spot in 1831 the red spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878 it was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century both giovanni borelli and cassini made careful tables of the motions of jupiters moons allowing predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet by the 1670s it was observed that when jupiter was on the opposite side of the sun from earth these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected ole rmer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously a conclusion that cassini had earlier rejected and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light in 1892 e e barnard observed a fifth satellite of jupiter with the 36-inch 910mm refractor at lick observatory in california the discovery of this relatively small object a testament to his keen eyesight quickly made him famous this moon was later named amalthea it was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by visual observation in 1932 rupert wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of jupiter three long-lived anticyclonic features termed white ovals were observed in 1938 for several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere sometimes approaching each other but never merging finally two of the ovals merged in 1998 then absorbed the third in 2000 becoming oval ba radiotelescope research in 1955 bernard burke and kenneth franklin detected bursts of radio signals coming from jupiter at 222mhz the period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate radio bursts from jupiter were found to come in two forms long bursts or l-bursts lasting up to several seconds and short bursts or s-bursts that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second scientists discovered that there were three forms of radio signals transmitted from jupiter decametric radio bursts with a wavelength of tens of meters vary with the rotation of jupiter and are influenced by interaction of io with jupiters magnetic field decimetric radio emission with wavelengths measured in centimeters was first observed by frank drake and hein hvatum in 1959 the origin of this signal was from a torus-shaped belt around jupiters equator this signal is caused by cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in jupiters magnetic field thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of jupiter exploration since 1973 a number of automated spacecraft have visited jupiter most notably the pioneer 10 space probe the first spacecraft to get close enough to jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the solar systems largest planet flights to other planets within the solar system are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or delta-v entering a hohmann transfer orbit from earth to jupiter from low earth orbit requires a delta-v of 63kms which is comparable to the 97kms delta-v needed to reach low earth orbit gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration flyby missions beginning in 1973 several spacecraft have performed planetary flyby maneuvers that brought them within observation range of jupiter the pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of jupiters atmosphere and several of its moons they discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment the trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the jovian system radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of jupiters diameter and the amount of polar flattening six years later the voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the galilean moons and discovered jupiters rings they also confirmed that the great red spot was anticyclonic comparison of images showed that the red spot had changed hue since the pioneer missions turning from orange to dark brown a torus of ionized atoms was discovered along ios orbital path and volcanoes were found on the moons surface some in the process of erupting as the spacecraft passed behind the planet it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere the next mission to encounter jupiter was the ulysses solar probe it performed a flyby maneuver to attain a polar orbit around the sun during this pass the spacecraft conducted studies on jupiters magnetosphere ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken a second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance in 2000 the cassini probe flew by jupiter on its way to saturn and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet the new horizons probe flew by jupiter for a gravity assist en route to pluto its closest approach was on february 28 2007 the probes cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on io and studied all four galilean moons in detail as well as making long-distance observations of the outer moons himalia and elara imaging of the jovian system began september 4 2006 galileo mission the first spacecraft to orbit jupiter was the galileo probe which entered orbit on december 7 1995 it orbited the planet for over seven years conducting multiple flybys of all the galilean moons and amalthea the spacecraft also witnessed the impact of comet shoemakerlevy 9 as it approached jupiter in 1994 giving a unique vantage point for the event its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio antenna although extensive information was still gained about the jovian system from galileo a 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in july 1995 entering jupiters atmosphere on december 7 it parachuted through 150km 93mi of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2575kmh 1600mph and collected data for 576minutes before the signal was lost at a pressure of about 23 atmospheres at a temperature of 153c it melted thereafter and possibly vaporized the galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on september 21 2003 at a speed of over 50kms to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating europa a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life data from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90 of jupiters atmosphere the recorded temperature was more than 300c 570f and the windspeed measured more than 644kmh 400mph before the probes vapourised juno mission nasas juno mission arrived at jupiter on july 4 2016 and is expected to complete 37 orbits over the next 20 months the mission plan called for juno to study the planet in detail from a polar orbit on august 27 2016 the spacecraft completed its first fly-by of jupiter and sent back the first-ever images of jupiters north pole future probes the next planned mission to the jovian system will be the european space agencys jupiter icy moon explorer juice due to launch in 2022 followed by nasas europa clipper mission in 2025 canceled missions there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail because of the possibility of subsurface liquid oceans on jupiters moons europa ganymede and callisto funding difficulties have delayed progress nasas jimo jupiter icy moons orbiter was cancelled in 2005 a subsequent proposal was developed for a joint nasaesa mission called ejsmlaplace with a provisional launch date around 2020 ejsmlaplace would have consisted of the nasa-led jupiter europa orbiter and the esa-led jupiter ganymede orbiter however esa had formally ended the partnership by april 2011 citing budget issues at nasa and the consequences on the mission timetable instead esa planned to go ahead with a european-only mission to compete in its l1 cosmic vision selection moons jupiter has 79 known natural satellites of these 63 are less than 10 kilometres in diameter and have only been discovered since 1975 the four largest moons visible from earth with binoculars on a clear night known as the galilean moons are io europa ganymede and callisto galilean moons the moons discovered by galileoio europa ganymede and callistoare among the largest satellites in the solar system the orbits of three of them io europa and ganymede form a pattern known as a laplace resonance for every four orbits that io makes around jupiter europa makes exactly two orbits and ganymede makes exactly one this resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes the tidal force from jupiter on the other hand works to circularize their orbits the eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons shapes with jupiters gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away this tidal flexing heats the moons interiors by friction this is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost io which is subject to the strongest tidal forces and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of europas surface indicating recent resurfacing of the moons exterior classification before the discoveries of the voyager missions jupiters moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four based on commonality of their orbital elements since then the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture there are now thought to be six main groups although some are more distinct than others a basic sub-division is a grouping of the eight inner regular moons which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of jupiters equator and are thought to have formed with jupiter the remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up planetary rings jupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments an inner torus of particles known as the halo a relatively bright main ring and an outer gossamer ring these rings appear to be made of dust rather than ice as with saturns rings the main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites adrastea and metis material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence the orbit of the material veers towards jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts in a similar way the moons thebe and amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring there is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along amaltheas orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon interaction with the solar system along with the sun the gravitational influence of jupiter has helped shape the solar system the orbits of most of the systems planets lie closer to jupiters orbital plane than the suns equatorial plane mercury is the only planet that is closer to the suns equator in orbital tilt the kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by jupiter and the planet may have been responsible for the late heavy bombardment of the inner solar systems history along with its moons jupiters gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled into the regions of the lagrangian points preceding and following jupiter in its orbit around the sun these are known as the trojan asteroids and are divided into greek and trojan camps to commemorate the iliad the first of these 588 achilles was discovered by max wolf in 1906 since then more than two thousand have been discovered the largest is 624 hektor most short-period comets belong to the jupiter familydefined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than jupiters jupiter family comets are thought to form in the kuiper belt outside the orbit of neptune during close encounters with jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the sun and jupiter due to the magnitude of jupiters mass the center of gravity between it and the sun lies just above the suns surface jupiter is the only body in the solar system for which this is true impacts jupiter has been called the solar systems vacuum cleaner because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner solar system it receives the most frequent comet impacts of the solar systems planets it was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment however recent computer simulations suggest that jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner solar system as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them this topic remains controversial among scientists as some think it draws comets towards earth from the kuiper belt while others think that jupiter protects earth from the alleged oort cloud jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than earth a 1997 survey of early astronomical records and drawings suggested that a certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer giovanni cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar the survey initially produced eight more candidate sites as potential impact observations that he and others had recorded between 1664 and 1839 it was later determined however that these candidate sites had little or no possibility of being the results of the proposed impacts more recent discoveries include the following a fireball was photographed by voyager 1 during its jupiter encounter in march 1979 during the period july 16 1994 to july 22 1994 over 20 fragments from the comet shoemakerlevy9 sl9 formally designated d1993 f2 collided with jupiters southern hemisphere providing the first direct observation of a collision between two solar system objects this impact provided useful data on the composition of jupiters atmosphere on july 19 2009 an impact site was discovered at approximately 216 degrees longitude in system 2 this impact left behind a black spot in jupiters atmosphere similar in size to oval ba infrared observation showed a bright spot where the impact took place meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near jupiters south pole a fireball smaller than the previous observed impacts was detected on june 3 2010 by anthony wesley an amateur astronomer in australia and was later discovered to have been captured on video by another amateur astronomer in the philippines yet another fireball was seen on august 20 2010 on september 10 2012 another fireball was detected on march 17 2016 an asteroid or comet struck and was filmed on video see also jupiter portal solar system portal outline of jupiter hip 11915 a solar analog approximately 186 light-years
