vacuum energy is an underlying background energy that exists in space throughout the entire universe this behavior is codified in heisenbergs energytime uncertainty principle still the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify the vacuum energy is a special case of zero-point energy that relates to the quantum vacuum the effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as spontaneous emission the casimir effect and the lamb shift and are thought to influence the behavior of the universe on cosmological scales using the upper limit of the cosmological constant the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10 joules 10 ergs per cubic meter however in both quantum electrodynamics qed and stochastic electrodynamics sed consistency with the principle of lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the planck constant suggest a much larger value of 10 joules per cubic meter this huge discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem origin quantum field theory states that all fundamental fields such as the electromagnetic field must be quantized at each and every point in space a field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position the theory requires vibrations in or more accurately changes in the strength of such a field to propagate as per the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question the second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ballspring combination be quantized that is that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space canonically if the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics thus according to the theory even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum the theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle such as spin or polarization in the case of light energy and so on according to the theory most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word one important exception however is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy the quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy or zero-point energy of such an oscillator to be e 1 2 h displaystyle efrac 12hnu summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity to remove this infinity one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable much as the concept of potential energy has been treated in classical mechanics for centuries this argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization in all practical calculations this is how the infinity is handled vacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of virtual particles also known as vacuum fluctuations which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum these particles are always created out of the vacuum in particleantiparticle pairs which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear however these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing a process which can be mapped using feynman diagrams note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point and therefore suffers the same renormalization problems additional contributions to the vacuum energy come from spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory implications vacuum energy has a number of consequences in 1948 dutch physicists hendrik b g casimir and dirk polder predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to resonances in the vacuum energy in the space between them this is now known as the casimir effect and has since been extensively experimentally verified it is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is real in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons magnetic fields etc are real however alternative explanations for the casimir effect have since been proposed other predictions are harder to verify vacuum fluctuations are always created as particleantiparticle pairs the creation of these virtual particles near the event horizon of a black hole has been hypothesized by physicist stephen hawking to be a mechanism for the eventual evaporation of black holes if one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this then the other particle becomes real and energymass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole this loss is cumulative and could result in the black holes disappearance over time the time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole the more rapidly it evaporates but could be on the order of 10 years for large solar-mass black holes the vacuum energy also has important consequences for physical cosmology general relativity predicts that energy is equivalent to mass and therefore if the vacuum energy is really there it should exert a gravitational force essentially a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the cosmological constant which affects the expansion of the universe in the special case of vacuum energy general relativity stipulates that the gravitational field is proportional to 3p where is the massenergy density and p is the pressure quantum theory of the vacuum further stipulates that the pressure of the zero-state vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to thus the total is 3p 3 2 a negative value if indeed the vacuum ground state has non-zero energy the calculation implies a repulsive gravitational field giving rise to acceleration of the expansion of the universe however the vacuum energy is mathematically infinite without renormalization which is based on the assumption that we can only measure energy in a relative sense which is not true if we can observe it indirectly via the cosmological constant the existence of vacuum energy is also sometimes used as theoretical justification for the possibility of free-energy machines it has been argued that due to the broken symmetry in qed free energy does not violate conservation of energy since the laws of thermodynamics only apply to equilibrium systems however consensus amongst physicists is that this is unknown as the nature of vacuum energy remains an unsolved problem in particular the second law of thermodynamics is unaffected by the existence of vacuum energy however in stochastic electrodynamics the energy density is taken to be a classical random noise wave field which consists of real electromagnetic noise waves propagating isotropically in all directions the energy in such a wave field would seem to be accessible eg with nothing more complicated than a directional coupler the most obvious difficulty appears to be the spectral distribution of the energy which compatibility with lorentz invariance requires to take the form kf where k is a constant and f denotes frequency it follows that the energy and momentum flux in this wave field only becomes significant at extremely short wavelengths where directional coupler technology is currently lacking history in 1934 georges lematre used an unusual perfect-fluid equation of state to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy in 1948 the casimir effect provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy in 1955 however evgeny lifshitz offered a different origin for the casimir effect in 1957 lee and yang proved the concepts of broken symmetry and parity violation for which they won the nobel prize in 1973 edward tryon proposed the zero-energy universe hypothesis that the universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive massenergy is balanced by negative gravitational potential energy during the 1980s there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a grand unification theory and to use observations of the universe to confirm one or another version however the exact nature of the particles or fields that generate vacuum energy with a density such as that required by inflation theory remains a mystery see also casimir effect cosmological constant dark energy false vacuum
