the parthian empire prin 247bc 224ad also known as the arsacid empire rssd was a major iranian political and cultural power in ancient iran its latter name comes from arsaces i of parthia who as leader of the parni tribe founded it in the mid-3rd century bc when he conquered the region of parthia in irans northeast then a satrapy province under andragoras in rebellion against the seleucid empire mithridates i of parthia rc171138bc greatly expanded the empire by seizing media and mesopotamia from the seleucids at its height the parthian empire stretched from the northern reaches of the euphrates in what is now central-eastern turkey to eastern iran the empire located on the silk road trade route between the roman empire in the mediterranean basin and the han empire of china became a center of trade and commerce the parthians largely adopted the art architecture religious beliefs and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire which encompassed persian hellenistic and regional cultures for about the first half of its existence the arsacid court adopted elements of greek culture though it eventually saw a gradual revival of iranian traditions the arsacid rulers were titled the king of kings as a claim to be the heirs to the achaemenid empire indeed they accepted many local kings as vassals where the achaemenids would have had centrally appointed albeit largely autonomous satraps the court did appoint a small number of satraps largely outside iran but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the achaemenid potentates with the expansion of arsacid power the seat of central government shifted from nisa to ctesiphon along the tigris south of modern baghdad iraq although several other sites also served as capitals the earliest enemies of the parthians were the seleucids in the west and the scythians in the east however as parthia expanded westward they came into conflict with the kingdom of armenia and eventually the late roman republic rome and parthia competed with each other to establish the kings of armenia as their subordinate clients the parthians soundly defeated marcus licinius crassus at the battle of carrhae in 53bc and in 4039bc parthian forces captured the whole of the levant except tyre from the romans however mark antony led a counterattack against parthia although his successes were generally achieved in his absence under the leadership of his lieutenant ventidius various roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded mesopotamia in the course of the ensuing roman-parthian wars of the next few centuries the romans captured the cities of seleucia and ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts but were never able to hold on to them frequent civil wars between parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the empires stability than foreign invasion and parthian power evaporated when ardashir i ruler of istakhr in persis revolted against the arsacids and killed their last ruler artabanus v in 224ad ardashir established the sassanid empire which ruled iran and much of the near east until the muslim conquests of the 7th century ad although the arsacid dynasty lived on through the arsacid dynasty of armenia the arsacid dynasty of iberia and the arsacid dynasty of caucasian albania all eponymous branches of the parthian arsacids native parthian sources written in parthian greek and other languages are scarce when compared to sassanid and even earlier achaemenid sources aside from scattered cuneiform tablets fragmentary ostraca rock inscriptions drachma coins and the chance survival of some parchment documents much of parthian history is only known through external sources these include mainly greek and roman histories but also chinese histories prompted by the han chinese desire to form alliances against the xiongnu parthian artwork is viewed by historians as a valid source for understanding aspects of society and culture that are otherwise absent in textual sources history origins and establishment before arsaces i of parthia founded the arsacid dynasty he was chieftain of the parni an ancient central-asian tribe of iranian peoples and one of several nomadic tribes within the confederation of the dahae the parni most likely spoke an eastern iranian language in contrast to the northwestern iranian language spoken at the time in parthia the latter was a northeastern province first under the achaemenid and then the seleucid empires after conquering the region the parni adopted parthian as the official court language speaking it alongside middle persian aramaic greek babylonian sogdian and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer why the arsacid court retroactively chose 247bc as the first year of the arsacid era is uncertain adh bivar concludes that this was the year the seleucids lost control of parthia to andragoras the appointed satrap who rebelled against them hence arsaces i backdated his regnal years to the moment when seleucid control over parthia ceased however vesta sarkhosh curtis asserts that this was simply the year arsaces was made chief of the parni tribe homa katouzian and gene ralph garthwaite claim it was the year arsaces conquered parthia and expelled the seleucid authorities yet curtis and maria brosius state that andragoras was not overthrown by the arsacids until 238bc it is unclear who immediately succeeded arsaces i bivar and katouzian affirm that it was his brother tiridates i of parthia who in turn was succeeded by his son arsaces ii of parthia in 211bc yet curtis and brosius state that arsaces ii was the immediate successor of arsaces i with curtis claiming the succession took place in 211bc and brosius in 217bc bivar insists that 138bc the last regnal year of mithridates i is the first precisely established regnal date of parthian history due to these and other discrepancies bivar outlines two distinct royal chronologies accepted by historians a fictitious claim was later made from the 2nd-century bc onwards by the parthians which represented them as descendants of the achaemenid king of kings artaxerxes ii of persia r404358 bc for a time arsaces consolidated his position in parthia and hyrcania by taking advantage of the invasion of seleucid territory in the west by ptolemy iii euergetes r246222bc of egypt this conflict with ptolemy the third syrian war 246241bc also allowed diodotus i to rebel and form the greco-bactrian kingdom in central asia the latters successor diodotus ii formed an alliance with arsaces against the seleucids but arsaces was temporarily driven from parthia by the forces of seleucus ii callinicus r246225bc after spending some time in exile among the nomadic apasiacae tribe arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured parthia seleucus iis successor antiochus iii the great r222187bc was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of molon in media antiochus iii launched a massive campaign to retake parthia and bactria in 210 or 209bc he was unsuccessful but did negotiate a peace settlement with arsaces ii the latter was granted the title of king greek basileus in return for his submission to antiochus iii as his superior the seleucids were unable to further intervene in parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the roman republic and the seleucid defeat at magnesia in 190bc phriapatius of parthia r c191176bc succeeded arsaces ii and phraates i of parthia r c176171bc eventually ascended the throne phraates i ruled parthia without further seleucid interference expansion and consolidation phraates i is recorded as expanding parthias control past the gates of alexander and occupied apamea ragiana the locations of these are unknown yet the greatest expansion of parthian power and territory took place during the reign of his brother and successor mithridates i of parthia r c171138 bc whom katouzian compares to cyrus the great d 530 bc founder of the achaemenid empire relations between parthia and greco-bactria deteriorated after the death of diodotus ii when mithridates forces captured two eparchies of the latter kingdom then under eucratides i r c170145bc turning his sights on the seleucid realm mithridates invaded media and occupied ecbatana in 148 or 147bc the region had been destabilized by a recent seleucid suppression of a rebellion there led by timarchus this victory was followed by the parthian conquest of babylonia in mesopotamia where mithridates had coins minted at seleucia in 141bc and held an official investiture ceremony while mithridates retired to hyrcania his forces subdued the kingdoms of elymais and characene and occupied susa by this time parthian authority extended as far east as the indus river whereas hecatompylos had served as the first parthian capital mithridates established royal residences at seleucia ecbatana ctesiphon and his newly founded city mithradatkert nisa turkmenistan where the tombs of the arsacid kings were built and maintained ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the arsacid royalty ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of gotarzes i of parthia r c9080bc it became the site of the royal coronation ceremony and the representational city of the arsacids according to brosius the seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general diodotus tryphon led a rebellion at the capital antioch in 142 bc however by 140bc demetrius ii nicator was able to launch a counter-invasion against the parthians in mesopotamia despite early successes the seleucids were defeated and demetrius himself was captured by parthian forces and taken to hyrcania there mithridates treated his captive with great hospitality he even married his daughter rhodogune of parthia to demetrius antiochus vii sidetes r138129bc a brother of demetrius assumed the seleucid throne and married the latters wife cleopatra thea after defeating diodotus tryphon antiochus initiated a campaign in 130bc to retake mesopotamia now under the rule of phraates ii of parthia rc138128bc the parthian general indates was defeated along the great zab followed by a local uprising where the parthian governor of babylonia was killed antiochus conquered babylonia and occupied susa where he minted coins after advancing his army into media the parthians pushed for peace which antiochus refused to accept unless the arsacids relinquished all lands to him except parthia proper paid heavy tribute and released demetrius from captivity arsaces released demetrius and sent him to syria but refused the other demands by spring 129bc the medes were in open revolt against antiochus whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter while attempting to put down the revolts the main parthian force swept into the region and killed antiochus in battle his body was sent back to syria in a silver coffin his son seleucus was made a parthian hostage and a daughter joined phraates harem while the parthians regained the territories lost in the west another threat arose in the east in 177176bc the nomadic confederation of the xiongnu dislodged the nomadic yuezhi from their homelands in what is now gansu province in northwest china the yuezhi then migrated west into bactria and displaced the saka scythian tribes the saka were forced to move further west where they invaded the parthian empires northeastern borders mithridates was thus forced to retire to hyrcania after his conquest of mesopotamia some of the saka were enlisted in phraates forces against antiochus however they arrived too late to engage in the conflict when phraates refused to pay their wages the saka revolted which he tried to put down with the aid of former seleucid soldiers yet they too abandoned phraates and joined sides with the saka phraates ii marched against this combined force but he was killed in battle the roman historian justin reports that his successor artabanus i of parthia r c128124bc shared a similar fate fighting nomads in the east he claims artabanus was killed by the tokhari identified as the yuezhi although bivar believes justin conflated them with the saka mithridates ii of parthia r c12490bc later recovered the lands lost to the saka in sistan following the seleucid withdrawal from mesopotamia the parthian governor of babylonia himerus was ordered by the arsacid court to conquer characene then ruled by hyspaosines from charax spasinu when this failed hyspaosines invaded babylonia in 127bc and occupied seleucia yet by 122bc mithridates ii forced hyspaosines out of babylonia and made the kings of characene vassals under parthian suzerainty after mithridates extended parthian control further west occupying dura-europos in 113bc he became embroiled in a conflict with the kingdom of armenia his forces defeated and deposed artavasdes i of armenia in 97bc taking his son tigranes hostage who would later become tigranes ii the great of armenia r c9555bc the indo-parthian kingdom located in modern-day afghanistan and pakistan made an alliance with the parthian empire in the 1st century bc bivar claims that these two states considered each other political equals after the greek philosopher apollonius of tyana visited the court of vardanes i of parthia r c4047ad in 42ad vardanes provided him with the protection of a caravan as he traveled to indo-parthia when apollonius reached indo-parthias capital taxila his caravan leader read vardanes official letter perhaps written in parthian to an indian official who treated apollonius with great hospitality following the diplomatic venture of zhang qian into central asia during the reign of emperor wu of han r14187bc the han empire of china sent a delegation to mithridates iis court in 121bc the han embassy opened official trade relations with parthia via the silk road yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the xiongnu the parthian empire was enriched by taxing the eurasian caravan trade in silk the most highly priced luxury good imported by the romans pearls were also a highly valued import from china while the chinese purchased parthian spices perfumes and fruits exotic animals were also given as gifts from the arsacid to han courts in 87 ad pacorus ii of parthia sent lions and persian gazelles to emperor zhang of han r7588ad besides silk parthian goods purchased by roman merchants included iron from india spices and fine leather caravans traveling through the parthian empire brought west asian and sometimes roman luxury glasswares to china the merchants of sogdia speaking an eastern iranian language served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between parthia and han china rome and armenia the yuezhi kushan empire in northern india largely guaranteed the security of parthias eastern border thus from the mid-1st century bc onwards the arsacid court focused on securing the western border primarily against rome a year following mithridates iis subjugation of armenia lucius cornelius sulla the roman proconsul of cilicia convened with the parthian diplomat orobazus at the euphrates river the two agreed that the river would serve as the border between parthia and rome although several historians have argued that sulla only had authority to communicate these terms back to rome despite this agreement in 93 or 92bc parthia fought a war in syria against the tribal leader laodice and her seleucid ally antiochus x eusebes r9592bc killing the latter when one of the last seleucid monarchs demetrius iii eucaerus attempted to besiege beroea modern aleppo parthia sent military aid to the inhabitants and demetrius was defeated following the rule of mithridates ii gotarzes i ruled babylonia while orodes i r c9080bc ruled parthia separately this system of split monarchy weakened parthia allowing tigranes ii of armenia to annex parthian territory in western mesopotamia this land would not be restored to parthia until the reign of sanatruces of parthia r c7871bc following the outbreak of the third mithridatic war mithridates vi of pontus r11963bc an ally of tigranes ii of armenia requested aid from parthia against rome but sanatruces refused help when the roman commander lucullus marched against the armenian capital tigranocerta in 69bc mithridates vi and tigranes ii requested the aid of phraates iii of parthia r c7158 phraates did not send aid to either and after the fall of tigranocerta he reaffirmed with lucullus the euphrates as the boundary between parthia and rome tigranes the younger son of tigranes ii of armenia failed to usurp the armenian throne from his father he fled to phraates iii and convinced him to march against armenias new capital at artaxarta when this siege failed tigranes the younger once again fled this time to the roman commander pompey he promised pompey that he would act as a guide through armenia but when tigranes ii submitted to rome as a client king tigranes the younger was brought to rome as a hostage phraates demanded pompey return tigranes the younger to him but pompey refused in retaliation phraates launched an invasion into corduene southeastern turkey where according to two conflicting roman accounts the roman consul lucius afranius forced the parthians out by either military or diplomatic means phraates iii was assassinated by his sons orodes ii of parthia and mithridates iii of parthia after which orodes turned on mithridates forcing him to flee from media to roman syria aulus gabinius the roman proconsul of syria marched in support of mithridates to the euphrates but had to turn back to aid ptolemy xii auletes r8058 5551bc against a rebellion in egypt despite losing his roman support mithridates managed to conquer babylonia and minted coins at seleucia until 54bc in that year orodes general known only as surena after his noble familys clan name recaptured seleucia and mithridates was executed marcus licinius crassus one of the triumvirs who was now proconsul of syria launched an invasion into parthia in 53bc in belated support of mithridates as his army marched to carrhae modern harran southeastern turkey orodes ii invaded armenia cutting off support from romes ally artavasdes ii of armenia r5334bc orodes persuaded artavasdes to a marriage alliance between the crown prince pacorus i of parthia d38bc and artavasdes sister surena with an army entirely on horseback rode to meet crassus surenas 1000 cataphracts armed with lances and 9000 horse archers were outnumbered roughly four to one by crassus army comprising seven roman legions and auxiliaries including mounted gauls and light infantry relying on a baggage train of about 1000 camels the parthian horse archers were given constant supplies of arrows the horse archers employed the parthian shot tactic where they would fake a retreat only to turn and fire upon their opponents this tactic combined with the use of heavy composite bows on flat plain devastated crassus infantry with some 20000 romans dead approximately 10000 captured and roughly another 10000 escaping west crassus fled into the armenian countryside at the head of his army surena approached crassus offering a parley which crassus accepted however he was killed when one of his junior officers suspecting a trap attempted to stop him from riding into surenas camp crassus defeat at carrhae was one of the worst military defeats of roman history parthias victory cemented its reputation as a formidable if not equal power with rome with his camp followers war captives and precious roman booty surena traveled some 700km 430mi back to seleucia where his victory was celebrated however fearing his ambitions even for the arsacid throne orodes had surena executed shortly thereafter emboldened by the victory over crassus the parthians attempted to capture roman-held territories in western asia crown prince pacorus i and his commander osaces raided syria as far as antioch in 51 bc but were repulsed by gaius cassius longinus who ambushed and killed osaces the arsacids sided with pompey in his civil war against julius caesar and even sent troops to support the anti-caesarian forces at the battle of philippi in 42bc quintus labienus a general loyal to cassius and brutus sided with parthia against the second triumvirate in 40 bc the following year he invaded syria alongside pacorus i the triumvir mark antony was unable to lead the roman defense against parthia due to his departure to italy where he amassed his forces to confront his rival octavian and eventually conducted negotiations with him at brundisium after syria was occupied by pacorus army labienus split from the main parthian force to invade anatolia while pacorus and his commander barzapharnes invaded the roman levant they subdued all settlements along the mediterranean coast as far south as ptolemais modern acre israel with the lone exception of tyre in judea the pro-roman jewish forces of high priest hyrcanus ii phasael and herod were defeated by the parthians and their jewish ally antigonus ii mattathias r4037bc the latter was made king of judea while herod fled to his fort at masada despite these successes the parthians were soon driven out of the levant by a roman counteroffensive publius ventidius bassus an officer under mark antony defeated and then executed labienus at the battle of the cilician gates in modern mersin province turkey in 39 bc shortly afterward a parthian force in syria led by general pharnapates was defeated by ventidius at the battle of amanus pass as a result pacorus i temporarily withdrew from syria when he returned in the spring of 38bc he faced ventidius at the battle of mount gindarus northeast of antioch pacorus was killed during the battle and his forces retreated across the euphrates his death spurred a succession crisis in which orodes ii chose phraates iv of parthia r c382bc as his new heir upon assuming the throne phraates iv eliminated rival claimants by killing and exiling his own brothers one of them monaeses fled to antony and convinced him to invade parthia antony defeated parthias judaean ally antigonus in 37bc installing herod as a client king in his place the following year when antony marched to erzurum artavasdes ii of armenia once again switched alliances by sending antony additional troops antony invaded media atropatene modern iranian azerbaijan then ruled by parthias ally artavasdes i of media atropatene with the intention of seizing the capital praaspa the location of which is now unknown however phraates iv ambushed antonys rear detachment destroying a giant battering ram meant for the siege of praaspa after this artavasdes abandoned antonys forces the parthians pursued and harassed antonys army as it fled to armenia eventually the greatly weakened force reached syria after this antony lured artavasdes ii into a trap with the promise of a marriage alliance he was taken captive in 34 bc paraded in antonys mock roman triumph in alexandria egypt and eventually executed by cleopatra vii of the ptolemaic kingdom antony attempted to strike an alliance with artavasdes i of media atropatene whose relations with phraates iv had recently soured this was abandoned when antony and his forces withdrew from armenia in 33bc they escaped a parthian invasion while antonys rival octavian attacked his forces to the west following antonys suicide in egypt followed by that of his wife cleopatra in 30 bc the parthian ally artaxias ii reassumed the throne of armenia peace with rome court intrigue and contact with chinese generals following the defeat of antony and cleopatra of ptolemaic egypt at the battle of actium in 31bc octavian consolidated his political power and in 27bc was named augustus by the roman senate becoming the first roman emperor around this time tiridates ii of parthia briefly overthrew phraates iv who was able to quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of scythian nomads tiridates fled to the romans taking one of phraates sons with him in negotiations conducted in 20bc phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son in return the romans received the lost legionary standards taken at carrhae in 53bc as well as any surviving prisoners of war the parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over parthia this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins the building of a new temple to house the standards and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue augustus of prima porta along with the prince augustus also gave phraates iv an italian slave-girl who later became queen musa of parthia to ensure that her child phraataces would inherit the throne without incident musa convinced phraates iv to give his other sons to augustus as hostages again augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of parthia to rome listing it as a great accomplishment in his res gestae divi augusti when phraataces took the throne as phraates v r c2bc 4ad musa married her own son and ruled alongside him the parthian nobility disapproving of both the incestuous relationship and the notion of a king with non-arsacid blood forced the pair into exile in roman territory phraates successor orodes iii of parthia lasted just two years on the throne and was followed by vonones i who had adopted many roman mannerisms during time in rome the parthian nobility angered by vonones sympathies for the romans backed a rival claimant artabanus iii of parthia r c1038ad who eventually defeated vonones and drove him into exile in roman syria during the reign of artabanus iii two jewish commoners and brothers anilai and asinai from nehardea near modern fallujah iraq led a revolt against the parthian governor of babylonia after defeating the latter the two were granted the right to govern the region by artabanus iii who feared further rebellion elsewhere anilais parthian wife poisoned asinai out of fear he would attack anilai over his marriage to a gentile following this anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of artabanus who eventually defeated him with the jewish regime removed the native babylonians began to harass the local jewish community forcing them to emigrate to seleucia when that city rebelled against parthian rule in 3536ad the jews were expelled again this time by the local greeks and aramaeans the exiled jews fled to ctesiphon nehardea and nisibis although at peace with parthia rome still interfered in its affairs the roman emperor tiberius r1437ad became involved in a plot by pharasmanes i of iberia to place his brother mithridates on the throne of armenia by assassinating the parthian ally king arsaces of armenia artabanus iii tried and failed to restore parthian control of armenia prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to scythia the romans released a hostage prince tiridates iii of parthia to rule the region as an ally of rome shortly before his death artabanus managed to force tiridates from the throne using troops from hyrcania after artabanus death in 38ad a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor vardanes i and his brother gotarzes ii of parthia after vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition the parthian nobility appealed to roman emperor claudius r 4154ad in 49ad to release the hostage prince meherdates to challenge gotarzes this backfired when meherdates was betrayed by the governor of edessa and izates bar monobaz of adiabene he was captured and sent to gotarzes where he was allowed to live after having his ears mutilated an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne in 97ad the chinese general ban chao the protector-general of the western regions sent his emissary gan ying on a diplomatic mission to reach the roman empire gan visited the court of pacorus ii at hecatompylos before departing towards rome he traveled as far west as the persian gulf where parthian authorities convinced him that an arduous sea voyage around the arabian peninsula was the only means to reach rome discouraged by this gan ying returned to the han court and provided emperor he of han r88105ad with a detailed report on the roman empire based on oral accounts of his parthian hosts william watson speculates that the parthians would have been relieved at the failed efforts by the han empire to open diplomatic relations with rome especially after ban chaos military victories against the xiongnu in eastern central asia however chinese records maintain that a roman embassy perhaps only a group of roman merchants arrived at the han capital luoyang by way of jiaozhi northern vietnam in 166ad during the reigns of marcus aurelius r 161180ad and emperor huan of han r 146168ad although it could be coincidental antonine roman golden medallions dated to the reigns of marcus aurelius and his predecessor antoninus pius have been discovered at oc eo vietnam among other roman artefacts in the mekong delta a site that is one of the suggested locations for the port city of cattigara along the magnus sinus ie gulf of thailand and south china sea in ptolemys geography continuation of roman hostilities and parthian decline after the iberian king pharasmanes i had his son rhadamistus r5155ad invade armenia to depose the roman client king mithridates vologeses i of parthia r c5177ad planned to invade and place his brother the later tiridates i of armenia on the throne rhadamistus was eventually driven from power and beginning with the reign of tiridates parthia would retain firm control over armeniawith brief interruptionsthrough the arsacid dynasty of armenia even after the fall of the parthian empire the arsacid line lived on through the armenian kings however not only did the arsacid line continue through the armenians it as well continued through the georgian kings with the arsacid dynasty of iberia and for many centuries afterwards in caucasian albania through the arsacid dynasty of caucasian albania when vardanes ii of parthia rebelled against his father vologeses i in 55ad vologeses withdrew his forces from armenia rome quickly attempted to fill the political vacuum left behind in the romanparthian war of 5863ad the commander gnaeus domitius corbulo achieved some military successes against the parthians while installing tigranes vi of armenia as a roman client however corbulos successor lucius caesennius paetus was soundly defeated by parthian forces and fled armenia following a peace treaty tiridates i traveled to naples and rome in 63 ad at both sites the roman emperor nero r5468ad ceremoniously crowned him king of armenia by placing the royal diadem on his head a long period of peace between parthia and rome ensued with only the invasion of alans into parthias eastern territories around 72ad mentioned by roman historians whereas augustus and nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting parthia later roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern fertile crescent the heart of the parthian empire along the tigris and euphrates the heightened aggression can be explained in part by romes military reforms to match parthias strength in missile troops and mounted warriors the romans at first used foreign allies especially nabataeans but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry the romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers sagittarii and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces yet the romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions the primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor as well as defending roman honor against perceived slights such as parthian interference in the affairs of romes client states hostilities between rome and parthia were renewed when osroes i of parthia r c109128ad deposed the armenian king sanatruk and replaced him with axidares son of pacorus ii without consulting rome the roman emperor trajan r98117ad had the next parthian nominee for the throne parthamasiris killed in 114ad instead making armenia a roman province his forces led by lusius quietus also captured nisibis its occupation was essential to securing all the major routes across the northern mesopotamian plain the following year trajan invaded mesopotamia and met little resistance from only meharaspes of adiabene since osroes was engaged in a civil war to the east with vologases iii of parthia trajan spent the winter of 115116 at antioch but resumed his campaign in the spring marching down the euphrates he captured dura-europos the capital ctesiphon and seleucia and even subjugated characene where he watched ships depart to india from the persian gulf in the last months of 116ad trajan captured the persian city of susa when sanatruces ii of parthia gathered forces in eastern parthia to challenge the romans his cousin parthamaspates of parthia betrayed and killed him trajan crowned him the new king of parthia never again would the roman empire advance so far to the east on trajans return north the babylonian settlements revolted against the roman garrisons trajan was forced to retreat from mesopotamia in 117ad overseeing a failed siege of hatra during his withdrawal his retreat wasin his intentionstemporary because he wanted to renew the attack on parthia in 118 ad and make the subjection of the parthians a reality but trajan died suddenly in august 117ad during his campaign trajan was granted the title parthicus by the senate and coins were minted proclaiming the conquest of parthia however only the 4th-century ad historians eutropius and festus allege that he attempted to establish a roman province in lower mesopotamia trajans successor hadrian r117138ad reaffirmed the roman-parthian border at the euphrates choosing not to invade mesopotamia due to romes now limited military resources parthamaspates fled after the parthians revolted against him yet the romans made him king of osroene osroes i died during his conflict with vologases iii the latter succeeded by vologases iv of parthia r c147191ad who ushered in a period of peace and stability however the romanparthian war of 161166ad began when vologases invaded armenia and syria retaking edessa roman emperor marcus aurelius r161180ad had co-ruler lucius verus r161169ad guard syria while marcus statius priscus invaded armenia in 163ad followed by the invasion of mesopotamia by avidius cassius in 164ad the romans captured and burnt seleucia and ctesiphon to the ground yet they were forced to retreat once the roman soldiers contracted a deadly disease possibly smallpox that soon ravaged the roman world although they withdrew from this point forward the city of dura-europos remained in roman hands when roman emperor septimius severus r193211ad invaded mesopotamia in 197ad during the reign of vologases v of parthia r c191208ad the romans once again marched down the euphrates and captured seleucia and ctesiphon after assuming the title parthicus maximus he retreated in late 198ad failing as trajan once did to capture hatra during a siege around 212ad soon after vologases vi of parthia r c208222ad took the throne his brother artabanus v of parthia d224ad rebelled against him and gained control over a greater part of the empire meanwhile the roman emperor caracalla r211217ad deposed the kings of osroene and armenia to make them roman provinces once more he marched into mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of artabanus daughters butbecause the marriage was not allowedmade war on parthia and conquered arbil east of the tigris river caracalla was assassinated the next year on the road to carrhae by his soldiers after this debacle the parthians made a settlement with macrinus r217218 where the romans paid parthia over two-hundred million denarii with additional gifts the parthian empire weakened by internal strife and wars with rome was soon to be followed by the sassanid empire indeed shortly afterward ardashir i the local iranian ruler of persis modern fars province iran from estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of arsacid rule he confronted artabanus v at the battle of hormozdgn on 28 april 224ad perhaps at a site near isfahan defeating him and establishing the sassanid empire there is evidence however that suggests vologases vi continued to mint coins at seleucia as late as 228ad the sassanians would not only assume parthias legacy as romes persian nemesis but they would also attempt to restore the boundaries of the achaemenid empire by briefly conquering the levant anatolia and egypt from the eastern roman empire during the reign of khosrau ii r590628ad however they would lose these territories to heracliusthe last roman emperor before the arab conquests nevertheless for a period of more than 400 years they succeeded the parthian realm as romes principal rival native and external sources local and foreign written accounts as well as non-textual artifacts have been used to reconstruct parthian history although the parthian court maintained records the parthians had no formal study of history the earliest universal history of iran the khwaday-namag was not compiled until the reign of the last sassanid ruler yazdegerd iii r 632651ad indigenous sources on parthian history remain scarce with fewer of them available than for any other period of iranian history most contemporary written records on parthia contain greek as well as parthian and aramaic inscriptions the parthian language was written in a distinct script derived from the imperial aramaic chancellery script of the achaemenids and later developed into the pahlavi writing system the most valuable indigenous sources for reconstructing an accurate chronology of arsacid rulers are the metal drachma coins issued by each ruler these represent a transition from non-textual to textual remains according to historian geo widengren other parthian sources used for reconstructing chronology include cuneiform astronomical tablets and colophons discovered in babylonia indigenous textual sources also include stone inscriptions parchment and papyri documents and pottery ostraca for example at the early parthian capital of mithradatkertnisa in turkmenistan large caches of pottery ostraca have been found yielding information on the sale and storage of items like wine along with parchment documents found at sites like dura-europos these also provide valuable information on parthian governmental administration covering issues such as taxation military titles and provincial organization the greek and latin histories which represent the majority of materials covering parthian history are not considered entirely reliable since they were written from the perspective of rivals and wartime enemies these external sources generally concern major military and political events and often ignore social and cultural aspects of parthian history the romans usually depicted the parthians as fierce warriors but also as a culturally refined people recipes for parthian dishes in the cookbook apicius exemplifies their admiration for parthian cuisine apollodorus of artemita and arrian wrote histories focusing on parthia which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories isidore of charax who lived during the reign of augustus provides an account of parthian territories perhaps from a parthian government survey to a lesser extent people and events of parthian history were also included in the histories of justin strabo diodorus siculus plutarch cassius dio appian josephus pliny the elder and herodian parthian history can also be reconstructed via the chinese historical records of events in contrast to greek and roman histories the early chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing parthia although the habit of chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works of undetermined origin makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events the chinese called parthia nx chinese old chinese pronunciation ansjk perhaps after the greek name for the parthian city antiochia in margiana greek however this could also have been a transliteration of arsaces after the dynastys eponymous founder the works and historical authors include the shiji also known as the records of the grand historian by sima qian the han shu book of han by ban biao ban gu and ban zhao and the hou han shu book of later han by fan ye they provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early saka invasion of parthia and valuable political and geographical information for example the shiji ch 123 describes diplomatic exchanges exotic gifts given by mithridates ii to the han court types of agricultural crops grown in parthia production of wine using grapes itinerant merchants and the size and location of parthian territory the shiji also mentions that the parthians kept records by writing horizontally on strips of leather that is parchment government and administration central authority and semi-autonomous kings compared with the earlier achaemenid empire the parthian government was notably decentralized an indigenous historical source reveals that territories overseen by the central government were organized in a similar manner to the seleucid empire they both had a threefold division for their provincial hierarchies the parthian marzbn xatrap and dizpat similar to the seleucid satrapy eparchy and hyparchy the parthian empire also contained several subordinate semi-autonomous kingdoms including the states of caucasian iberia armenia atropatene gordyene adiabene edessa hatra mesene elymais and persis the state rulers governed their own territories and minted their own coinage distinct from the royal coinage produced at the imperial mints this was not unlike the earlier achaemenid empire which also had some city-states and even distant satrapies who were semi-independent but recognised the supremacy of the king paid tribute and provided military support according to brosius however the satraps of parthian times governed smaller territories and perhaps had less prestige and influence than their achaemenid predecessors during the seleucid period the trend of local ruling dynasties with semi-autonomous rule and sometimes outright rebellious rule became commonplace a fact reflected in the later parthian style of governance nobility the king of kings headed the parthian government he maintained polygamous relations and was usually succeeded by his first-born son like the ptolemies of egypt there is also record of arsacid kings marrying their nieces and perhaps even half-sisters queen musa married her own son though this was an extreme and isolated case brosius provides an extract from a letter written in greek by king artabanus ii in 21ad which addresses the governor titled archon and citizens of the city of susa specific government offices of preferred friend bodyguard and treasurer are mentioned and the document also proves that while there were local jurisdictions and proceedings to appointment to high office the king could intervene on behalf of an individual review a case and amend the local ruling if he considered it appropriate the hereditary titles of the hierarchic nobility recorded during the reign of the first sassanid monarch ardashir i most likely reflect the titles already in use during the parthian era there were three distinct tiers of nobility the highest being the regional kings directly below the king of kings the second being those related to the king of kings only through marriage and the lowest order being heads of local clans and small territories by the 1st century ad the parthian nobility had assumed great power and influence in the succession and deposition of arsacid kings some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king as well as holy priests strabo in his geographica preserved a claim by the greek philosopher and historian poseidonius that the council of parthia consisted of noble kinsmen and magi two groups from which the kings were appointed of the great noble parthian families listed at the beginning of the sassanian period only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier parthian documents the house of suren and the house of karen the historian plutarch noted that members of the suren family the first among the nobility were given the privilege of crowning each new arsacid king of kings during their coronations later on some of the parthian kings would claim achaemenid descent this has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease neurofibromatosis demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage military the parthian empire had no standing army yet were able to quickly recruit troops in the event of local crises there was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king comprising nobles serfs and mercenaries but this royal retinue was small garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures for example when chinese envoys visited parthia in the late 2nd century bc the shiji maintains that 20000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration the main striking force of the parthian army was its cataphracts heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor the cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers due to the cost of their equipment and armor cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who in return for their services demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the arsacid kings the light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle they used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them this technique known as the parthian shot was a highly effective tactic the heavy and light cavalry of parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the battle of carrhae where a parthian force defeated a much larger roman army under crassus light infantry units composed of levied commoners and mercenaries were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges the size of the parthian army is unknown as is the size of the empires overall population however archaeological excavations in former parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower dense population centers in regions like babylonia were no doubt attractive to the romans whose armies could afford to live off the land currency usually made of silver the greek drachma coin including the tetradrachm was the standard currency used throughout the parthian empire the arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of hecatompylos seleucia and ecbatana they most likely operated a mint at mithridatkertnisa as well from the empires inception until its collapse drachmas produced throughout the parthian period rarely weighed less than 35g or more than 42g the first parthian tetradrachms weighing in principle around 16g with some variation appear after mithridates i conquered mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at seleucia society and culture hellenism and the iranian revival although greek culture of the seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the near east during the hellenistic period the parthian era witnessed an iranian cultural revival in religion the arts and even clothing fashions conscious of both the hellenistic and persian cultural roots of their kingship the arsacid rulers styled themselves after the persian king of kings and affirmed that they were also philhellenes friends of the greeks the word philhellene was inscribed on parthian coins until the reign of artabanus ii the discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of iranian culture in parthia vologases i was the first arsacid ruler to have the parthian script and language appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible greek however the use of greek-alphabet legends on parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire greek cultural influence did not disappear from the parthian empire however and there is evidence that the arsacids enjoyed greek theatre when the head of crassus was brought to orodes ii he alongside armenian king artavasdes ii were busy watching a performance of the bacchae by the playwright euripides c480406 bc the producer of the play decided to use crassus actual severed head in place of the stage-prop head of pentheus on his coins arsaces i is depicted in apparel similar to achaemenid satraps according to a shahbazi arsaces deliberately diverges from seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations and he calls himself krnykarny greek autocrator a title already borne by achaemenid supreme generals such as cyrus the younger in line with achaemenid traditions rock-relief images of arsacid rulers were carved at mount behistun where darius i of persia r 522486 bc made royal inscriptions moreover the arsacids claimed familial descent from artaxerxes ii of persia r404358 bc as a means to bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former achaemenid territories ie as being legitimate successors of glorious kings of ancient iran artabanus iii named one of his sons darius and laid claim to cyrus heritage the arsacid kings chose typical zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the heroic background of the avesta according to vg lukonin the parthians also adopted the use of the babylonian calendar with names from the achaemenid iranian calendar replacing the macedonian calendar of the seleucids religion the parthian empire being culturally and politically heterogeneous had a variety of religious systems and beliefs the most widespread being those dedicated to greek and iranian cults aside from a minority of jews and early christians most parthians were polytheistic greek and iranian deities were often blended together as one for example zeus was often equated with ahura mazda hades with angra mainyu aphrodite and hera with anahita apollo with mithra and hermes with shamash aside from the main gods and goddesses each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities as with seleucid rulers parthian art indicates that the arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods this cult of the ruler was perhaps the most widespread the extent of arsacid patronism of zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship the followers of zoroaster would have found the bloody sacrifices of some parthian-era iranian cults to be unacceptable however there is evidence that vologeses i encouraged the presence of zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred zoroastrian texts which later formed the avesta the sassanid court would later adopt zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire although mani 216276 ad the founding prophet of manichaeism did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228229 ad bivar asserts that his new faith contained elements of mandaean belief iranian cosmogony and even echoes of christianity it may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late arsacid period which the zoroastrian orthodoxy of the sasanians was soon to sweep away there is scant archaeological evidence for the spread of buddhism from the kushan empire into iran proper however it is known from chinese sources that an shigao fl 2nd century ad a parthian nobleman and buddhist monk traveled to luoyang in han china as a buddhist missionary and translated several buddhist canons into chinese art and architecture parthian art can be divided into three geo-historical phases the art of parthia proper the art of the iranian plateau and the art of parthian mesopotamia the first genuine parthian art found at mithridatkertnisa combined elements of greek and iranian art in line with achaemenid and seleucid traditions in the second phase parthian art found inspiration in achaemenid art as exemplified by the investiture relief of mithridates ii at mount behistun the third phase occurred gradually after the parthian conquest of mesopotamia common motifs of the parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the investiture of arsacid kings use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers common art mediums were rock-reliefs frescos and even graffiti geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on stucco and plaster walls the common motif of the sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the parthian reliefs at mount behistun in portraiture the parthians favored and emphasized frontality meaning the person depicted by painting sculpture or raised-relief on coins faced the viewer directly instead of showing his or her profile although frontality in portraiture was already an old artistic technique by the parthian period daniel schlumberger explains the innovation of parthian frontality parthian frontality as we are now accustomed to call it deeply differs both from ancient near eastern and from greek frontality though it is no doubt an offspring of the latter for both in oriental art and in greek art frontality was an exceptional treatment in oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for a small number of traditional characters of cult and myth in greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons when demanded by the subject and on the whole seldom made use of with parthian art on the contrary frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure for the parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing in relief and in painting all figures full-face even at the expense as it seems to us moderns of clearness and intelligibility so systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes this singular state of things seems to have become established in the course of the 1st century ad parthian art with its distinct use of frontality in portraiture was lost and abandoned with the profound cultural and political changes brought by the sassanid empire however even after the roman occupation of dura-europos in 165 ad the use of parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there this is exemplified by the early 3rd-century ad wall murals of the dura-europos synagogue a temple in the same city dedicated to palmyrene gods and the local mithraeum parthian architecture adopted elements of achaemenid and greek architecture but remained distinct from the two the style is first attested at mithridatkertnisa the round hall of nisa is similar to hellenistic palaces but different in that it forms a circle and vault inside a square space however the artwork of nisa including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory rhyton vessels is unquestionably influenced by greek art a signature feature of parthian architecture was the iwan an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side use of the barrel vault replaced the hellenic use of columns to support roofs although the iwan was known during the achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures it was the parthians who first built them on a monumental scale the earliest parthian iwans are found at seleucia built in the early 1st century ad monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of hatra and perhaps modeled on the parthian style the largest parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m 50ft clothing and apparel the typical parthian riding outfit is exemplified by the famous bronze statue of a parthian nobleman found at shami elymais standing 19m 6ft the figure wears a v-shaped jacket a v-shaped tunic fastened in place with a belt loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters and a diadem or band over his coiffed bobbed hair his outfit is commonly seen in relief images of parthian coins by the mid-1st century bc examples of clothing in parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at hatra in northwestern iraq statues erected there feature the typical parthian shirt qamis combined with trousers and made with fine ornamented materials the aristocratic elite of hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles headdresses and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central arsacid court the trouser-suit was even worn by the arsacid kings as shown on the reverse images of coins the parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in palmyra syria along with the use of parthian frontality in art parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress with necklaces earrings bracelets and headdresses bedecked in jewelry their many-folded dresses were fastened by a brooch at one shoulder their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards as seen in parthian coinage the headdresses worn by the parthian kings changed over time the earliest arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps known as the bashlyk greek kyrbasia this may have derived from an achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the achaemenid reliefs at behistun and persepolis the earliest coins of mithridates i show him wearing the soft cap yet coins from the latter part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal hellenistic diadem mithridates ii was the first to be shown wearing the parthian tiara embroidered with pearls and jewels a headdress commonly worn in the late parthian period and by sassanid monarchs language as culturally and religiously tolerant as the parthians were they adopted greek as their official language while aramaic remained the lingua franca in the empire the native parthian language middle persian and akkadian were also used writing and literature it is known that during the parthian period the court minstrel gsn recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music however their stories composed in verse form were not written down until the subsequent sassanian period in fact there is no known parthian-language literature that survives in original form since it was written down in the following centuries it is believed that such stories as the romantic tale vis and rmin and epic cycle of the kayanian dynasty were part of the corpus of oral literature from parthian times although compiled much later although literature of the parthian language was not committed to written form there is evidence that the arsacids acknowledged and respected written greek
