the celsius scale also known as the centigrade scale is a temperature scale used by the international system of units si as an si derived unit it is used by all countries except the united states the bahamas belize the cayman islands and liberia it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius 17011744 who developed a similar temperature scale the degree celsius c can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty before being renamed to honor anders celsius in 1948 the unit was called centigrade from the latin centum which means 100 and gradus which means steps from 1743 the celsius scale is based on 0c for the freezing point of water and 100c for the boiling point of water at 1atm pressure prior to 1743 the scale was also based on the boiling and melting points of water but the values were reversed ie the boiling point was at 0 degrees and the melting point was at 100 degrees the 1743 scale reversal was proposed by jean-pierre christin by international agreement since 1954 the unit degree celsius and the celsius scale are defined by absolute zero and the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow a specially purified water this definition also precisely relates the celsius scale to the kelvin scale which defines the si base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol k absolute zero the lowest temperature possible is defined as being exactly 0k and 27315c the temperature of the triple point of water is defined as exactly 27316k 001c this means that a temperature difference of one degree celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same on may 20 2019 the degree kelvin and along with it the degree celsius will again be re-defined so that its value will be determined by definition of the boltzmann constant history in 1742 swedish astronomer anders celsius 17011744 created a temperature scale that was the reverse of the scale now known as celsius 0 represented the boiling point of water while 100 represented the freezing point of water in his paper observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure he also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure he proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale being the boiling point would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level this pressure is known as one standard atmosphere the bipms 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1013250 dynes per square centimetre 101325kpa in 1743 the lyonnais physicist jean-pierre christin permanent secretary of the acadmie des sciences belles-lettres et arts de lyon working independently of celsius developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water on 19 may 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer the thermometer of lyon built by the craftsman pierre casati that used this scale in 1744 coincident with the death of anders celsius the swedish botanist carl linnaeus 17071778 reversed celsiuss scale his custom-made linnaeus-thermometer for use in his greenhouses was made by daniel ekstrm swedens leading maker of scientific instruments at the time whose workshop was located in the basement of the stockholm observatory as often happened in this age before modern communications numerous physicists scientists and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale among them were pehr elvius the secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences which had an instrument workshop and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding daniel ekstrm the instrument maker and mrten strmer 17071770 who had studied astronomy under anders celsius the first known swedish document reporting temperatures in this modern forward celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensis dated 16 december 1745 that linnaeus wrote to a student of his samuel nauclr in it linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the university of uppsala botanical garden since the caldarium the hot part of the greenhouse by the angle of the windows merely from the rays of the sun obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees and in winter not under 15 degrees centigrade hectograde and celsius since the 19th century the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide have used the phrase centigrade scale temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or when greater specificity was desired as degrees centigrade symbol c because the term centigrade was also the spanish and french language name for a unit of angular measurement 110000 of a right angle and had a similar connotation in other languages the term centesimal degree known as the gradian grad or gon 1 09 100 90 was used when very precise unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the bipm more properly what was defined as centigrade then would now be hectograde to eliminate any confusion the 9th cgpm and the cipm comit international des poids et mesures formally adopted degree celsius in 1948 formally keeping the recognized degree symbol rather than adopting the gradiancentesimal degree symbol for scientific use celsius is the term usually used with centigrade remaining in common but decreasing use especially in informal contexts in english-speaking countries it was not until february 1985 that the weather forecasts issued by the bbc switched from centigrade to celsius common temperatures some key temperatures relating the celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below name and symbol typesetting the degree celsius has been the only si unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the si base unit for temperature the kelvin became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degrees kelvin the plural form is degrees celsius the general rule of the international bureau of weights and measures bipm is that the numerical value always precedes the unit and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number eg 302 c not 302c or 302c the only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree minute and second for plane angle and respectively for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol other languages and various publishing houses may follow different typographical rules unicode character unicode provides the celsius symbol at code point u2103 degree celsius however this is a compatibility character provided for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings it easily allows correct rendering for vertically written east asian scripts such as chinese the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character in normal use it is better to represent degrees celsius c with a sequence of u00b0 degree sign u0043 c latin capital letter c rather than u2103 degree celsius for searching treat these two sequences as identical shown below is the degree celsius character followed immediately by the two-component version when viewed on computers that properly support unicode the above line may be similar to the image in the line below enlarged for clarity the canonical decomposition is simply an ordinary degree sign and c so some browsers may simply display c in its place due to unicode normalization temperatures and intervals the degree celsius is subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol thus besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale eg gallium melts at 297646c and the temperature outside is 23 degrees celsius the degree celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals differences between temperatures or their uncertainties eg the output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees celsius and our standard uncertainty is 3c because of this dual usage one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval this is sometimes solved by using the symbol c pronounced degrees celsius for a temperature and c pronounced celsius degrees for a temperature interval although this usage is non-standard another way to express the same is 40c 3 k which can be commonly found in literature celsius measurement follows an interval system but not a ratio system and it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale for example 20c is not twice the heat energy of 10c and 0c is not the lowest celsius value thus degrees celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance coexistence of kelvin and celsius scales in science and in engineering the celsius scale and the kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts eg a measured value was 001023c with an uncertainty of 70k this practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree celsius is equal to that of the kelvin notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision 3 of resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm which stated a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius the practice of simultaneously using both c and k remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of si-prefixed forms of the degree celsius such as c or microdegrees celsius to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted melting and boiling points of water one effect of defining the celsius scale at the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 27316k and 001c and at absolute zero 0k and 27315c is that neither the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere 101325kpa remains a defining point for the celsius scale in 1948 when the 9th general conference on weights and measures cgpm in resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point the triple point was so close to being 001c greater than waters known melting point it was simply defined as precisely 001c however current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of vsmow is actually very slightly 0001c greater than 001c thus the actual melting point of ice is very slightly less than a thousandth of a degree below 0c also defining waters triple point at 27316k precisely defined the magnitude of each 1c increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale referencing absolute zero now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water the value 100c is hotter than 0c in absolute terms by a factor of precisely 3731527315 approximately 3661 thermodynamically hotter when adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration the boiling point of vsmow under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 3731339k 999839c when calibrated to its-90 a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation the boiling point of vsmow is slightly less about 99974c this boiling-point difference of 161 millikelvins between the celsius scales original definition and the current one based on absolute zero and the triple point has little practical meaning in common daily applications because waters boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure for example an altitude change of only 28cm 11in causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin see also comparison of temperature scales degree of frost its-90 raumur scale thermodynamic temperature notes the dictionary definition of celsius
