the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap originally known as the microwave anisotropy probe map was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave backgroundcmb the radiant heat remaining from the big bang headed by professor charles l bennett of johns hopkins university the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the nasa goddard space flight center and princeton university the wmap spacecraft was launched on june 30 2001 from florida the wmap mission succeeded the cobe space mission and was the second medium-class midex spacecraft in the nasa explorers program in 2003 map was renamed wmap in honor of cosmologist david todd wilkinson 19352002 who had been a member of the missions science team after nine years of operations wmap was switched off in 2010 following the launch of the more advanced planck spacecraft by esa in 2009 wmaps measurements played a key role in establishing the current standard model of cosmology the lambda-cdm model the wmap data are very well fit by a universe that is dominated by dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant other cosmological data are also consistent and together tightly constrain the model in the lambda-cdm model of the universe the age of the universe is 7001137720000000000137720059 billion years the wmap missions determination of the age of the universe is to better than 1 precision the current expansion rate of the universe is see hubble constant 70016931999999999996932080kmsmpc the content of the universe currently consists of 699846280000000000046280093 ordinary baryonic matter 69992402000000000002402088 087 cold dark matter cdm that neither emits nor absorbs light and 69997134999999999997135095 096 of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant that accelerates the expansion of the universe less than 1 of the current content of the universe is in neutrinos but wmaps measurements have found for the first time in 2008 that the data prefer the existence of a cosmic neutrino background with an effective number of neutrino species of 7000326000000000000326035 the contents point to a euclidean flat geometry with curvature k displaystyle omega k of 30027300000000000000002700039 00038 the wmap measurements also support the cosmic inflation paradigm in several ways including the flatness measurement the mission has won various awards according to science magazine the wmap was the breakthrough of the year for 2003 this missions results papers were first and second in the super hot papers in science since 2003 list of the all-time most referenced papers in physics and astronomy in the inspire-hep database only three have been published since 2000 and all three are wmap publications bennett lyman a page jr and david n spergel the latter both of princeton university shared the 2010 shaw prize in astronomy for their work on wmap bennett and the wmap science team were awarded the 2012 gruber prize in cosmology the 2018 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to bennett gary hinshaw norman jarosik page spergel and the wmap science team as of october 2010 the wmap spacecraft is derelict in a heliocentric graveyard orbit after 9 years of operations all wmap data are released to the public and have been subject to careful scrutiny the final official data release was the nine-year release in 2012 some aspects of the data are statistically unusual for the standard model of cosmology for example the largest angular-scale measurement the quadrupole moment is somewhat smaller than the model would predict but this discrepancy is not highly significant a large cold spot and other features of the data are more statistically significant and research continues into these objectives the wmap objective was to measure the temperature differences in the cosmic microwave background cmb radiation the anisotropies then were used to measure the universes geometry content and evolution and to test the big bang model and the cosmic inflation theory for that the mission created a full-sky map of the cmb with a 13 arcminute resolution via multi-frequency observation the map required the fewest systematic errors no correlated pixel noise and accurate calibration to ensure angular-scale accuracy greater than its resolution the map contains 3145728 pixels and uses the healpix scheme to pixelize the sphere the telescope also measured the cmbs e-mode polarization and foreground polarization its service life was 27 months 3 to reach the l2 position 2 years of observation development the map mission was proposed to nasa in 1995 selected for definition study in 1996 and approved for development in 1997 the wmap was preceded by two missions to observe the cmb i the soviet relikt-1 that reported the upper-limit measurements of cmb anisotropies and ii the us cobe satellite that first reported large-scale cmb fluctuations the wmap was 45 times more sensitive with 33 times the angular resolution of its cobe satellite predecessor the successor european planck mission operational 20092013 had a higher resolution and higher sensitivity than wmap and observed in 9 frequency bands rather than wmaps 5 allowing improved astrophysical foreground models spacecraft the telescopes primary reflecting mirrors are a pair of gregorian 14m 16m dishes facing opposite directions that focus the signal onto a pair of 09m 10m secondary reflecting mirrors they are shaped for optimal performance a carbon fibre shell upon a korex core thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide the secondary reflectors transmit the signals to the corrugated feedhorns that sit on a focal plane array box beneath the primary reflectors the receivers are polarization-sensitive differential radiometers measuring the difference between two telescope beams the signal is amplified with hemt low-noise amplifiers built by the national radio astronomy observatory there are 20 feeds 10 in each direction from which a radiometer collects a signal the measure is the difference in the sky signal from opposite directions the directional separation azimuth is 180 degrees the total angle is 141 degrees to improve subtraction of foreground signals from our milky way galaxy the wmap used five discrete radio frequency bands from 23ghz to 94ghz the wmaps base is a 50m-diameter solar panel array that keeps the instruments in shadow during cmb observations by keeping the craft constantly angled at 22 degrees relative to the sun upon the array sit a bottom deck supporting the warm components and a top deck the telescopes cold components the focal-plane array and the mirrors are separated from the warm components with a cylindrical 33cm-long thermal isolation shell atop the deck passive thermal radiators cool the wmap to ca 90 degrees k they are connected to the low-noise amplifiers the telescope consumes 419 w of power the available telescope heaters are emergency-survival heaters and there is a transmitter heater used to warm them when off the wmap spacecrafts temperature is monitored with platinum resistance thermometers the wmaps calibration is effected with the cmb dipole and measurements of jupiter the beam patterns are measured against jupiter the telescopes data are relayed daily via a 2ghz transponder providing a 667kbits downlink to a 70m deep space network telescope the spacecraft has two transponders one a redundant back-up they are minimally active ca 40 minutes daily to minimize radio frequency interference the telescopes position is maintained in its three axes with three reaction wheels gyroscopes two star trackers and sun sensors and is steered with eight hydrazine thrusters launch trajectory and orbit the wmap spacecraft arrived at the kennedy space center on april 20 2001 after being tested for two months it was launched via delta ii 7425 rocket on june 30 2001 it began operating on its internal power five minutes before its launching and so continued operating until the solar panel array deployed the wmap was activated and monitored while it cooled on july 2 it began working first with in-flight testing from launching until august 17 then began constant formal work afterwards it effected three earth-moon phase loops measuring its sidelobes then flew by the moon on july 30 en route to the sun-earth l2 lagrangian point arriving there on october 1 2001 becoming the first cmb observation mission posted there the spacecrafts location at lagrange 2 15 million kilometers from earth minimizes the amount of contaminating solar terrestrial and lunar emissions registered and thermally stabilizes it to view the entire sky without looking to the sun the wmap traces a path around l2 in a lissajous orbit ca 10 degree to 10 degrees with a 6-month period the telescope rotates once every 2 minutes 9 seconds 0464 rpm and precesses at the rate of 1 revolution per hour wmap measured the entire sky every six months and completed its first full-sky observation in april 2002 wmap launches from kennedy space center june 30 2001 wmap launches from kennedy space center june 30 2001 the wmaps trajectory and orbit the wmaps trajectory and orbit wmaps orbit and sky scan strategy wmaps orbit and sky scan strategy foreground radiation subtraction the wmap observed in five frequencies permitting the measurement and subtraction of foreground contamination from the milky way and extra-galactic sources of the cmb the main emission mechanisms are synchrotron radiation and free-free emission dominating the lower frequencies and astrophysical dust emissions dominating the higher frequencies the spectral properties of these emissions contribute different amounts to the five frequencies thus permitting their identification and subtraction foreground contamination is removed in several ways first subtract extant emission maps from the wmaps measurements second use the components known spectral values to identify them third simultaneously fit the position and spectra data of the foreground emission using extra data sets foreground contamination was reduced by using only the full-sky map portions with the least foreground contamination whilst masking the remaining map portions measurements and discoveries one-year data release on february 11 2003 nasa published the first-years worth of wmap data the latest calculated age and composition of the early universe were presented in addition an image of the early universe that contains such stunning detail that it may be one of the most important scientific results of recent years was presented the newly released data surpass previous cmb measurements based upon the lambda-cdm model the wmap team produced cosmological parameters from the wmaps first-year results three sets are given below the first and second sets are wmap data the difference is the addition of spectral indices predictions of some inflationary models the third data set combines the wmap constraints with those from other cmb experiments acbar and cbi and constraints from the 2df galaxy redshift survey and lyman alpha forest measurements there are degenerations among the parameters the most significant is between n s displaystyle ns and displaystyle tau the errors given are at 68 confidence using the best-fit data and theoretical models the wmap team determined the times of important universal events including the redshift of reionization 7001170000000000000174 the redshift of decoupling 700310890000000000010891 and the universes age at decoupling 70131196033040000003798 7kyr and the redshift of matterradiation equality 70033233000000000003233194 210 they determined the thickness of the surface of last scattering to be 70021950000000000001952 in redshift or 70123723796800000001183 2kyr they determined the current density of baryons 6993250000000000000250110cm and the ratio of baryons to photons 69906100000000000006103 0210 the wmaps detection of an early reionization excluded warm dark matter the team also examined milky way emissions at the wmap frequencies producing a 208-point source catalogue three-year data release the three-year wmap data were released on march 17 2006 the data included temperature and polarization measurements of the cmb which provided further confirmation of the standard flat lambda-cdm model and new evidence in support of inflation the 3-year wmap data alone shows that the universe must have dark matter results were computed both only using wmap data and also with a mix of parameter constraints from other instruments including other cmb experiments acbar cbi and boomerang sdss the 2df galaxy redshift survey the supernova legacy survey and constraints on the hubble constant from the hubble space telescope a optical depth to reionization improved due to polarization measurements b 030 when combined with sdss data no indication of non-gaussianity five-year data release the five-year wmap data were released on february 28 2008 the data included new evidence for the cosmic neutrino background evidence that it took over half billion years for the first stars to reionize the universe and new constraints on cosmic inflation the improvement in the results came from both having an extra 2 years of measurements the data set runs between midnight on august 10 2001 to midnight of august 9 2006 as well as using improved data processing techniques and a better characterization of the instrument most notably of the beam shapes they also make use of the 33ghz observations for estimating cosmological parameters previously only the 41ghz and 61ghz channels had been used improved masks were used to remove foregrounds improvements to the spectra were in the 3rd acoustic peak and the polarization spectra the measurements put constraints on the content of the universe at the time that the cmb was emitted at the time 10 of the universe was made up of neutrinos 12 of atoms 15 of photons and 63 dark matter the contribution of dark energy at the time was negligible it also constrained the content of the present-day universe 46 atoms 23 dark matter and 72 dark energy the wmap five-year data was combined with measurements from type ia supernova sne and baryon acoustic oscillations bao the elliptical shape of the wmap skymap is the result of a mollweide projection the data puts limits on the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r 022 95 certainty which determines the level at which gravitational waves affect the polarization of the cmb and also puts limits on the amount of primordial non-gaussianity improved constraints were put on the redshift of reionization which is 700110900000000000010914 the redshift of decoupling 7003109088000000000109088072 as well as age of universe at decoupling 70131189630002960003769713162 3167kyr and the redshift of matterradiation equality 7003325300000000000325389 87 the extragalactic source catalogue was expanded to include 390 sources and variability was detected in the emission from mars and saturn seven-year data release the seven-year wmap data were released on january 26 2010 as part of this release claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated most were shown not to be statistically significant and likely due to a posteriori selection where one sees a weird deviation but fails to consider properly how hard one has been looking a deviation with 11000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times for the deviations that do remain there are no alternative cosmological ideas for instance there seem to be correlations with the ecliptic pole it seems most likely these are due to other effects with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues the other confirmation of major significance is of the total amount of matterenergy in the universe in the form of dark energy 728 within 16 as non particle background and dark matter 227 within 14 of non baryonic sub atomic particle energy this leaves matter or baryonic particles atoms at only 456 within 016 nine-year data release on december 20 2012 the nine-year wmap data and related images were released 7001137720000000000137720059 billion-year-old temperature fluctuations and a temperature range of 200 microkelvins are shown in the image in addition the study found that 95 of the early universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy the curvature of space is less than 04 percent of flat and the universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages about 400 million years after the big bang main result the main result of the mission is contained in the various oval maps of the cmb temperature differences these oval images present the temperature distribution derived by the wmap team from the observations by the telescope during the mission measured is the temperature obtained from a plancks law interpretation of the microwave background the oval map covers the whole sky the results are a snapshot of the universe around 375000 years after the big bang which happened about 138 billion years ago the microwave background is very homogeneous in temperature the relative variations from the mean which presently is still 27 kelvins are only of the order of 6995500000000000000510 the temperature variations corresponding to the local directions are presented through different colors the red directions are hotter the blue directions cooler than the average follow-on missions and future measurements the original timeline for wmap gave it two years of observations these were completed by september 2003 mission extensions were granted in 2002 2004 2006 and 2008 giving the spacecraft a total of 9 observing years which ended august 2010 and in october 2010 the spacecraft was moved to a heliocentric graveyard orbit outside l2 in which it orbits the sun 14 times every 15 years the planck spacecraft also measured the cmb from 2009 to 2013 and aims to refine the measurements made by wmap both in total intensity and polarization various ground- and balloon-based instruments have also made cmb contributions and others are being constructed to do so many are aimed at searching for the b-mode polarization expected from the simplest models of inflation including ebex spider bicep2 keck quiet class sptpol and others on 21 march 2013 the european-led research team behind the planck cosmology probe released the missions all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background the map suggests the universe is slightly older than previously thought according to the map subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the deep sky when the cosmos was about 370000 years old the imprint reflects ripples that arose as early in the existence of the universe as the first nonillionth 10 of a second apparently these ripples gave rise to the present vast cosmic web of galaxy clusters and dark matter based on the 2013 data the universe contains 49 ordinary matter 268 dark matter and 683 dark energy on 5 february 2015 new data was released by the planck mission according to which the age of the universe is 13799 0021 billion years old and the hubble constant was measured to be 6774 046 kmsmpc see also cosmology portal spaceflight portal
