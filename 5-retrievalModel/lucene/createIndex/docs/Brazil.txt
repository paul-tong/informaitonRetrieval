analysts brazil is a founding member of the united nations the g20 brics union of south american nations mercosul organization of american states organization of ibero-american states and the community of portuguese language countries etymology it is likely that the word brazil comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from brasa ember and the suffix -il from -iculum or -ilium as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil because of the brazilwood trade the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name some early sailors called it the land of parrots in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees history pre-cabraline era some of the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11000 years the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8000 years ago 6000 bc the pottery was found near santarm and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture the marajoara culture flourished on maraj in the amazon delta from 800 ce to 1400 ce developing sophisticated pottery social stratification large populations mound building and complex social formations such as chiefdoms around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups eg the tupis guaranis gs and arawaks the tup people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambs and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups before the arrival of the europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations portuguese colonization the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro lvares cabral the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupiguarani family and fought among themselves though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization effectively began in 1534 when king johniii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazils most important export and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colonys economy fostering a brazilian gold rush which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranho during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutchportuguese war after the end of iberian union the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugals wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy united kingdom with portugal in late 1807 spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joo in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to rio de janeiro there they established some of brazils first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joo return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the prior six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state however such a ploy didnt last long since the leadership in portugal resentful of the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820 and also groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as demonstrated by the 1817 pernambucan revolt in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto d joo vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore an oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcntara as regent of the kingdom of brazil independent empire tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the countrys independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the royal title of dom pedroi resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province the last portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 march 1824 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825 on 7 april 1831 worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in portugal had given in the succession of king john vi pedroi went to portugal to reclaim his daughters crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir who thus became the empires second monarch with the royal title of dom pedroii as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place such as the cabanagem in gro-par province the mal revolt in salvador da bahia the balaiada maranho the sabinada bahia and the ragamuffin war beginning in rio grande do sul and supported by giuseppe garibaldi these emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt in pernambuco was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841 during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related to issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil had borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedroii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history although there was no desire among the majority of brazilians to change the countrys form of government on 15 november 1889 in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup 15 november is now republic day a national holiday early republic the early republican government was nothing more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power only in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the civilians rose to power staying there until october 1930 if in relation to its foreign policy the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries only broken by the acre war 18991902 and its involvement in world war i 19141918 followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations internally from the crisis of encilhamento and the armada revolts a prolonged cycle of financial political and social instability began until the 1920s keeping the country besieged by various rebellions both civilian and military little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getlio vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the october 1930 coup vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with their own supporters in the 1930s three failed attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred the first was the constitutionalist revolution in 1932 led by the paulista oligarchy the second was a communist uprising in november 1935 and the last one a putsch attempt by local fascists in may 1938 the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive the 1937 coup dtat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election formalized vargas as dictator beginning the estado novo era which was noted for government brutality and censorship of the press foreign policy during vargas years was marked by the antecedents and world war ii brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side after suffering retaliation by nazi germany and fascist italy in a strategic dispute over the south atlantic in addition to its participation in the battle of the atlantic brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the italian campaign with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargass position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950 contemporary era several brief interim governments followed vargass suicide juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of braslia inaugurated in 1960 kubitscheks successor jnio quadros resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office his vice-president joo goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime the new regime was intended to be transitory but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968 oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society inside and outside the country through the infamous operation condor despite its brutality like other authoritarian regimes due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals ernesto geisel and golbery do couto e silva with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began a slow return to democracy which was completed during the 1980s civilians returned to power in 1985 when jos sarney assumed the presidency he became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime sarneys unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown fernando collor subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally stabilized the brazilian economy cardoso won the 1994 election and again in 1998 the peaceful transition of power from cardoso to his main opposition leader luiz incio lula da silva elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 was seen as proof that brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption police brutality inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula after winning election in 2010 enhanced by political and economic crises with evidence of involvement by politicians from all the primary political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes with large street protests for and against her rousseff was impeached by the brazilian congress in 2016 in 2017 the supreme court asked for the investigation of 71 brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers in president michel temers cabinet allegedly linked to the petrobras corruption scandal president temer is himself accused of corruption in 2018 62 of the population on a poll claimed that corruption was brazils biggest problem geography brazil occupies a

and chile it also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos such as fernando de noronha rocas atoll saint peter and paul rocks and trindade and martim vaz its size relief climate and natural resources make brazil geographically diverse including its atlantic islands brazil lies between latitudes 6n and 34s and longitudes 28 and 74w brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and

portion of amazonas to utc4 in the western states to utc3 in the eastern states the national time and utc2 in the atlantic islands brazil is the only country in the world that has the equator and the tropic of capricorn running through it brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills mountains plains highlands and scrublands much of the terrain lies between 200 metres 660ft and 800 metres 2600ft in elevation the main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country the northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad rolling terrain broken by low rounded hills the southeastern section is more rugged with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1200 metres 3900ft these ranges include the mantiqueira and espinhao mountains and the serra do mar in the north the guiana highlands form a major drainage divide separating rivers that flow south into the amazon basin from rivers that empty into the orinoco river system in venezuela to the north the highest point in brazil is the pico da neblina at 2994 metres 9823ft and the lowest is the atlantic ocean brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers one of the worlds most extensive with eight major drainage basins all of which drain into the atlantic major rivers include the amazon the worlds second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water the paran and its major tributary the iguau which includes the iguazu falls the negro so francisco xingu madeira and tapajs rivers climate the climate of brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography but most of the country is tropical according to the kppen system brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes desert equatorial tropical semiarid oceanic and subtropical the different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central brazil many regions have starkly different microclimates an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil there is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls temperatures average 25c 77f with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate this region is as extensive as the amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude in the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme the semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres 315in of rain most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought brazils 187778 grande seca great drought the worst in brazils history caused approximately half a million deaths a similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915 south of bahia near the coasts and more southerly most of the state of so paulo the distribution of rainfall changes with rain falling throughout the year the south enjoys subtropical conditions with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18c 644f winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas biodiversity and environment brazils large territory comprises different ecosystems such as the amazon rainforest recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world with the atlantic forest and the cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity in the south the araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions the rich wildlife of brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in brazil could approach four million mostly invertebrates larger mammals include carnivores pumas jaguars ocelots rare bush dogs and foxes and herbivores peccaries tapirs anteaters sloths opossums and armadillos deer are plentiful in the south and many species of new world monkeys are found in the northern rain forests concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues brazils amazon basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species including the red-bellied piranha despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger biodiversity can contribute to agriculture livestock forestry and fisheries extraction however almost all economically exploited species of plants such as soybeans and coffee or animals such as chickens are imported from other countries and the economic use of native species still crawls in the brazilian gdp the forest sector represents just over 1 and fishing 04 the natural heritage of brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture logging mining resettlement oil and gas extraction over-fishing wildlife trade dams and infrastructure water pollution climate change fire and invasive species in many areas of the country the natural environment is threatened by development the construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the amazon region including the controversial belo monte hydroelectric dam government and politics the form of government is a democratic federative republic with a presidential system the president is both head of state and head of government of the union and is elected for a four-year term with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term the current president is jair bolsonaro the previous president michel temer replaced dilma rousseff after her impeachment the president appoints the ministers of state who assist in government legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in brazil the national congress is the federations bicameral legislature consisting of the chamber of deputies and the federal senate judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively brazil is a democracy according to the democracy index 2010 the political-administrative organization of the federative republic of brazil comprises the union the states the federal district and the municipalities the union the states the federal district and the municipalities are the spheres of government the federation is set on five fundamental principles sovereignty citizenship dignity of human beings the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise and political pluralism the classic tripartite branches of government executive legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system are formally established by the constitution the executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and federal district spheres all members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams for most of its democratic history brazil has had a multi-party system proportional representation voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70 together with several smaller parties four political parties stand out workers party pt brazilian social democracy party psdb brazilian democratic movement mdb and democrats dem fifteen political parties are represented in congress it is common for politicians to switch parties and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the executive law brazilian law is based on the civil law legal system and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice most of brazilian law is codified although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part playing a complementary role court decisions set out interpretive guidelines however they are seldom binding on other specific cases doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases the legal system is based on the federal constitution promulgated on 5 october 1988 and is the fundamental law of brazil all other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules as of april2007 there have been 53 amendments states have their own constitutions which must not contradict the federal constitution municipalities and the federal district have organic laws leis orgnicas which act in a similar way to constitutions legislative entities are the main source of statutes although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities although in rare situations the federal constitution allows the federal senate to pass on legal judgments there are also specialized military labor and electoral courts the highest court is the supreme federal court this system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings nevertheless the supreme federal tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television and also via youtube more recently in december 2009 the supreme court adopted twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers to inform the daily actions of the court and the most important decisions made by them military the armed forces of brazil are the largest in latin america by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment it consists of the brazilian army including the army aviation command the brazilian navy including the marine corps and naval

second-largest in the americas once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two minas geraes-class dreadnoughts which sparked a south american dreadnought race between argentina brazil and chile today it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities grumec unit specially trained to protect brazilian oil platforms along its coast its the only navy in latin america that operates an aircraft carrier nae so paulo and one of the ten navies of the world to operate one the air force is the largest in latin america and has about 700 manned aircraft in service and effective about 67000 personnel brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the paraguayan war additionally brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours and neither does it have rivalries like chile and bolivia have with each other the brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the brazilian government it has built a tradition of participating in un peacekeeping missions such as in haiti east timor and central african republic foreign policy brazils international relations are based on article 4 of the federal constitution which establishes non-intervention self-determination international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of brazils relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations according to the constitution the president has ultimate authority over foreign policy while the congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties as well as legislation relating to brazilian foreign policy brazils foreign policy is a by-product of the countrys unique position as a regional power in latin america a leader among developing countries and an emerging world power brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism peaceful dispute settlement and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries an increasingly well-developed tool of brazils foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels total aid is estimated to be around 1billion per year that includes technical cooperation of around 480million 30million in 2010 provided directly by the brazilian cooperation agency abc an estimated 450million for in-kind expertise provided by brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation in addition brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in haiti 350million and makes in-kind contributions to the world food programme 300million this is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies the scale of this aid places it on par with china and india the brazilian south-south aid has been described as a global model in waiting law enforcement and crime in brazil the constitution establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement federal police department federal highway police federal railroad police military police and civil police of these the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments all police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers the national public security force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country the country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide in 2012 the world health organization who estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100000 inhabitants one of the highest rates of homicide of the world the number considered tolerable by the who is about 10 homicides per 100000 inhabitants however there are differences between the crime rates in the brazilian states while in so paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 108 deaths per 100000 inhabitants in alagoas it was 647 homicides per 100000 inhabitants brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world behind only china and the united states with an estimated total of approximately 700000 prisoners around the country june 2014 an increase of about 300 compared to the index registered in 1992 the high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the brazilian prison system leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations administrative divisions brazil is a federation composed of 26 states one federal district and the 5570 municipalities states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal government they have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters they also have independent courts of law for common justice despite this states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the united states for example criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral congress and are uniform throughout the country the states and the federal district may be grouped into regions northern northeast central-west southeast and southern the brazilian regions are merely geographical not political or administrative divisions and they do not have any specific form of government although defined by law brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects municipalities as the states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the union and state government each has a mayor and an elected legislative body but no separate court of law indeed a court of law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca county economy

brazil temporarily changed its monetary policy to a managed-float scheme while undergoing a currency crisis until definitively changing the exchange regime to free-float in january 1999 brazil

one of the issues the central bank of brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the us dollar against the real during that period nonetheless foreign direct investment fdi related to long-term less speculative investment in production is estimated to be 1938billion for 2007 inflation

weaknesses its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped ranked 116th with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness ranked 114th due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges as well as high prices and high taxation safety and security have improved significantly 75th in 2011 up from 128th in 2008 according to the world tourism organization wto international travel to brazil accelerated in 2000 particularly during 2004 and 2005 however in 2006 a slow-down took place and international arrivals had almost no growth in 200708 in spite of this trend revenues from international tourism continued to rise from usd 4billion in 2005 to 5billion in 2007 despite 330 000 fewer arrivals this favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the us dollar against the brazilian real which began in 2004 but which makes brazil a more expensive international destination this trend changed in 2009 when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the great recession of 200809 by 2010 the industry had recovered and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 52million international visitors and receipts from these visitors reached us6billion in 2011 the historical record was reached with 54million visitors and us68 billion in receipts despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues the number of brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003 resulting in a net negative foreign exchange balance as more money is spent abroad by brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting brazil tourism expenditures abroad grew from us58billion in 2006 to us82billion in 2007 a 42 increase representing a net deficit of us33billion in 2007 as compared to us15billion in 2006 a 125 increase from the previous year this trend is caused by brazilians taking advantage of the stronger real to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4 of the countrys population in 2005 tourism contributed with 32 of the countrys revenues from exports of goods and services and represented 7 of direct and indirect employment in the brazilian economy in 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 19million people domestic tourism is a fundamental

1950 with the founding of tv tupi by assis chateaubriand since then television has grown in the country creating large public networks such as globo sbt record and bandeirantes today it is the most

ratio of men to women of 0951 and 8375 of the population defined as urban the population is heavily concentrated in the southeastern 798million inhabitants and northeastern 535million inhabitants regions while the two most extensive regions the center-west and the north which together make up 6412 of the brazilian territory have a total of only 291million inhabitants the first census in brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9930478 from 1880 to 1930 4 million europeans arrived brazils population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970 because of a decline in the mortality rate even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline in the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 24 rising to 30 in the 1950s and remaining at 29 in the 1960s as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 726 years in 2007 it has been steadily falling since the 1960s from 304 per year between 1950 and 1960 to 105 in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of029

poor illiteracy was high 2418 among the rural population and lower 905 among the urban population race and ethnicity according to the national research by household sample pnad of 2008 4843 of the population about 92 million described themselves as white 4380 about 83 million as pardo brown 684 about 13 million as black 058 about 11million as asian and 028 about 536 thousand as amerindian officially called indgena indigenous while 007 about 130 thousand did not declare their race in 2007 the national indian foundation estimated that brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes up from their estimate of 40 in 2005 brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world since the arrival of the portuguese in 1500 considerable miscegenation between amerindians europeans and africans has taken place in all regions of the country with european ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population accounting for between 65 to 77 race and ethnicity in brazil brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines although a high income disparity is found between race groups so racism and classism can be conflated socially significant closeness to one racial group is taken in account more in the basis of appearance phenotypes rather than ancestry to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups socioeconomic factors are also significant because a minority of pardos are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry usually afro-brazilians are evenly mixed and european ancestry is dominant in whites and pardos with a significant non-european contribution but the individual variation is great the brown population officially called pardo in portuguese also colloquially moreno is a broad category that includes caboclos assimilated amerindians in general and descendants of whites and natives mulatos descendants of primarily whites and afro-brazilians and cafuzos descendants of afro-brazilians and natives people of

immigration about five million people from over 60 countries migrated to brazil between 1808 and 1972 most of them of portuguese italian spanish german ukrainian polish jewish russian chinese japanese and arab origin religion religion in brazil was formed from the meeting of the catholic church with the religious traditions of enslaved african peoples and indigenous peoples this confluence of faiths during the portuguese colonization of brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of brazilian catholic church characterized by traditional portuguese festivities and in some instances allan kardecs spiritism a religion which incorporates elements of spiritualism and christianity religious pluralism increased during the 20th century and the protestant community has grown to include over 22 of the population the most common protestant denominations are pentecostal and evangelical ones other protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the baptists seventh-day adventists lutherans and the reformed tradition roman catholicism is the countrys predominant faith brazil has the worlds largest catholic population according to the 2000 demographic census the pnad survey does not inquire about religion 7357 of the population followed roman catholicism 1541 protestantism 133 kardecist spiritism 122 other christian denominations 031 afro-brazilian religions 013 buddhism 005 judaism 002 islam 001 amerindian religions 059 other religions undeclared or undetermined while 735 have no religion however in the last ten years protestantism particularly in forms of pentecostalism and evangelicalism has spread in brazil while the proportion of catholics has dropped significantly after protestantism individuals professing no religion are also a significant group exceeding 7 of the population as of the 2000 census the cities of boa vista salvador and porto velho have the greatest proportion of irreligious residents in brazil teresina fortaleza and florianpolis were the most roman catholic in the country greater rio de janeiro not including the city proper is the most irreligious and least roman catholic brazilian periphery while greater porto alegre and greater fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists respectively urbanization according to ibge brazilian institute of geography and statistics urban areas already concentrate 8435 of the population while the southeast region remains the most populated one with over 80 million inhabitants the largest urban agglomerations in brazil are so paulo rio de janeiro and belo horizonte all in the southeastern region with 211 123 and 51million inhabitants respectively the majority of state capitals are the

constitution of the federal republic of brazil which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers radio television and for business and administrative purposes brazil is the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americas making the language an important part of brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its spanish-speaking neighbors brazilian portuguese has had its own development mostly similar to 16th-century central and southern dialects of european portuguese despite a very substantial number of portuguese colonial settlers and more recent immigrants coming from northern regions and in minor degree portuguese macaronesia with a few influences from the amerindian and african languages especially west african and bantu restricted to the vocabulary only as a result the language is somewhat different mostly in phonology from the language of portugal and other portuguese-speaking countries the dialects of the other countries partly because of the more recent end of portuguese colonialism in these regions have a closer connection to contemporary european portuguese these differences are comparable to those between american and british english in 1990 the community of portuguese language countries cplp which included representatives from all countries with portuguese as the official language reached an agreement on the reform of the portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other this spelling reform went into effect in brazil on 1 january 2009 in portugal the reform was signed into law by the president on 21 july 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period during which both orthographies will co-exist the remaining cplp countries are free to establish their own transition timetables the sign language law legally recognized in 2002 the law was regulated in 2005 the

and portuguese-based grammar that together with its southern relative lngua geral paulista once was a major lingua franca in brazil being replaced by portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changes baniwa and tucano languages had been granted co-official status with portuguese there are significant communities of german mostly the brazilian hunsrckisch a high german language dialect and italian mostly the talian a venetian dialect origins in the southern and southeastern regions whose ancestors native languages were carried along to brazil and which still alive there are influenced by the portuguese language talian is officially a historic patrimony of rio grande do sul and two german dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities learning at least one second language generally english or spanish is mandatory for all the 12 grades of the mandatory education system primary and secondary education there called ensino fundamental and ensino mdio respectively brazil is the first country in south america to offer esperanto to secondary students culture the core culture of brazil is derived from portuguese culture because of its strong colonial ties with the portuguese empire among other influences the portuguese introduced the portuguese language roman catholicism and colonial architectural styles the culture was however also strongly influenced by african indigenous and non-portuguese european cultures and traditions some aspects of brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of italian german and other european as well japanese jewish and arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the south and southeast of brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries the indigenous amerindians influenced brazils language and cuisine and the africans influenced language cuisine music dance and religion brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from baroque the dominant style in brazil until the early 19th century to romanticism modernism expressionism cubism surrealism and abstractionism brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s architecture the architecture of brazil is influenced by europe especially portugal it has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when pedro cabral discovered brazil in 1500 portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to brazil it is the basis for all brazilian architecture of later centuries in the 19th century during the time of the empire of brazil brazil followed european trends and adopted neoclassical and gothic revival architecture then in the 20th century especially in brasilia brazil experimented with modernist architecture the colonial architecture of brazil dates to the early 16th century when brazil was first explored conquered and settled by the portuguese the portuguese built architecture familiar to them in europe in their aim to colonise brazil they built portuguese colonial architecture which included churches civic architecture including houses and forts in brazilian cities and the countryside during 19th century brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more european styles to brazil such as neoclassical and gothic revival architecture this was usually mixed with brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of brazilian architecture in the 1950s the modernist architecture was introduced when brasilia was built as new federal capital in the interior of brazil to help develop the interior the architect oscar niemeyer idealized and built government buildings churches and civic buildings was constructed in the modernist style music the music of brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of european and african elements until the nineteenth century portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built brazilian music although many of these elements were not of portuguese origin but generally european the first was jos maurcio nunes garcia author of sacred pieces with influence of viennese classicism the major contribution of the african element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk flourishing especially in the twentieth century popular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically brazilian sound with samba considered the most typical and on the unesco cultural heritage list maracatu and afox are two afro-brazilian music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual brazilian carnivals the sport of capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music forr is a type of folk music prominent during the festa junina in northeastern brazil jack a draper iii a professor of portuguese at the university of missouri argues that forr was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle choro is a very popular music instrumental style its origins are in 19th-century rio de janeiro in spite of the name the style often has a fast and happy rhythm characterized by virtuosity improvisation subtle modulations and full of syncopation and counterpoint bossa nova is also a well-known style of brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s the phrase bossa nova means literally new trend a lyrical fusion of samba and jazz bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s literature brazilian literature dates back to the 16th century to the writings of the first portuguese explorers in brazil such as pro vaz de caminha filled with descriptions of fauna flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated european readers brazil produced significant works in romanticism novelists like joaquim manuel de macedo and jos de alencar wrote novels about love and pain alencar in his long career also treated indigenous people as heroes in the indigenist novels o guarani iracema and ubirajara machado de assis one of his contemporaries wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide brazilian modernism evidenced by the week of modern art in 1922 was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature while post-modernism brought a generation of distinct poets like joo cabral de melo neto carlos drummond de andrade vinicius de moraes cora coralina graciliano ramos ceclia meireles and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like jorge amado joo
