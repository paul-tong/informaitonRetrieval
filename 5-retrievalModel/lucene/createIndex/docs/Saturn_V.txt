the saturn v pronounced saturn five was an american human-rated expendable rocket used by nasa between 1967 and 1973 the three-stage liquid-propellant super heavy-lift launch vehicle was developed to support the apollo program for human exploration of the moon and was later used to launch skylab the first american space station the saturn v was launched 13 times from the kennedy space center in florida with no loss of crew or payload as of 2018 the saturn v remains the tallest heaviest and most powerful highest total impulse rocket ever brought to operational status and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload capacity to low earth orbit leo of 140000kg 310000lb which included the third stage and unburned propellant needed to send the apollo commandservice module and lunar module to the moon the largest production model of the saturn family of rockets the saturn v was designed under the direction of wernher von braun and arthur rudolph at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama with boeing north american aviation douglas aircraft company and ibm as the lead contractors to date the saturn v remains the only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low earth orbit a total of 15 flight-capable vehicles were built but only 13 were flown an additional three vehicles were built for ground testing purposes a total of 24 astronauts were launched to the moon three of them twice in the four years spanning december 1968 through december 1972 historical background the origins of the saturn v rocket begin with the us government bringing wernher von braun along with about seven hundred german rocket engineers and technicians to the united states in operation paperclip a program authorized by president truman in august 1946 with the purpose of harvesting germanys rocket expertise to give the us an edge in the cold war through development of intermediate-range irbm and intercontinental ballistic missiles icbm it was known that americas rival the soviet union would also try to secure some of the germans von braun was put into the rocket design division of the army due to his prior direct involvement in the creation of the v-2 rocket between 1945 and 1958 his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind the v-2 to the american engineers despite von brauns many articles on the future of space rocketry the us government continued funding air force and navy rocket programs to test their vanguard missiles in spite of numerous costly failures it was not until the 1957 soviet launch of sputnik 1 atop an r-7 icbm capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead to the us that the army and the government started taking serious steps towards putting americans in space finally they turned to von braun and his team who during these years created and experimented with the jupiter series of rockets the juno i was the rocket that launched the first american satellite in january 1958 and part of the last-ditch plan for naca the predecessor of nasa to get its foot in the space race the jupiter series was one more step in von brauns journey to the saturn v later calling that first series an infant saturn saturn development the saturn vs design stemmed from the designs of the jupiter series rockets as the success of the jupiter series became evident the saturn series emerged c-1 to c-4 between 1960 and 1962 the marshall space flight center msfc designed a series of saturn rockets that could be used for various earth orbit or lunar missions the c-1 was developed into the saturn i and the c-2 rocket was dropped early in the design process in favor of the c-3 which was intended to use two f-1 engines on its first stage four j-2 engines for its second stage and an s-iv stage using six rl10 engines nasa planned to use the c-3 as part of the earth orbit rendezvous eor concept with at least four or five launches needed for a single lunar mission but msfc was already planning an even bigger rocket the c-4 which would use four f-1 engines on its first stage an enlarged c-3 second stage and the s-ivb a stage with a single j-2 engine as its third stage the c-4 would need only two launches to carry out an eor lunar mission c-5 on january 10 1962 nasa announced plans to build the c-5 the three-stage rocket would consist of the s-ic first stage with five f-1 engines the s-ii second stage with five j-2 engines and the s-ivb third stage with a single j-2 engine the c-5 was designed for a 90000-pound 41000kg payload capacity to the moon the c-5 would undergo component testing even before the first model was constructed the s-ivb third stage would be used as the second stage for the c-ib which would serve both to demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility for the c-5 but would also provide flight data critical to development of the c-5 rather than undergoing testing for each major component the c-5 would be tested in an all-up fashion meaning that the first test flight of the rocket would include complete versions of all three stages by testing all components at once far fewer test flights would be required before a manned launch the c-5 was confirmed as nasas choice for the apollo program in early 1963 and was named the saturnv the c-1 became the saturn i and c-1b became saturn ib von braun headed a team at the marshall space flight center in building a vehicle capable of launching a manned spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon before they moved under nasas jurisdiction von brauns team had already begun work on improving the thrust creating a less complex operating system and designing better mechanical systems it was during these revisions that the decision to reject the single engine of the v-2s design came about and the team moved to a multiple-engine design the saturn i and ib reflected these changes but were not large enough to send a manned spacecraft to the moon these designs however provided a basis for which nasa could determine its best method towards landing a man on the moon the saturn vs final design had several key features engineers determined that the best engines were the f-1s coupled with the new liquid hydrogen propulsion system called j-2 which made the saturn c-5 configuration optimal by 1962 nasa had finalized its plans to proceed with von brauns saturn designs and the apollo space program gained speed with the configuration finalized nasa turned its attention to mission profiles despite some controversy a lunar orbit rendezvous for the lunar module was chosen over an earth orbital rendezvous issues such as type of fuel injections the needed amount of fuel for such a trip and rocket manufacturing processes were ironed out and the designs for the saturn v were selected the stages were designed by von brauns marshall space flight center in huntsville and outside contractors were chosen for the construction boeing s-ic north american aviation s-ii douglas aircraft s-ivb and ibm instrument unit selection for apollo lunar landing early in the planning process nasa considered three leading ideas for the moon mission earth orbit rendezvous direct ascent and lunar orbit rendezvous lor a direct ascent configuration would require an extremely large rocket to send a three-man spacecraft to land directly on the lunar surface earth orbit rendezvous would launch the direct-landing spacecraft in two smaller parts which would combine in earth orbit a lor mission would involve a single rocket launching two spacecraft a mother ship and a smaller two-man landing module which would rendezvous back with the main spacecraft in lunar orbit the lander would be discarded and the mother ship would return home nasa at first dismissed lor as a riskier option given that a space rendezvous had yet to be performed in earth orbit much less in lunar orbit several nasa officials including langley research center engineer john houbolt and nasa administrator george low argued that a lunar orbit rendezvous provided the simplest landing on the moon with the most costefficient launch vehicle and the best chance to accomplish the lunar landing within the decade other nasa officials were convinced and lor was officially selected as the mission configuration for the apollo program on november 7 1962 technology the saturn vs size and payload capacity dwarfed all other previous rockets which had successfully flown at that time with the apollo spacecraft on top it stood 363 feet 111m tall and without fins it was 33 feet 10m in diameter fully fueled the saturn v weighed 65 millionpounds 2950000kg and had a low earth orbit payload capacity originally estimated at 261000 pounds 118000kg but was designed to send at least 90000 pounds 41000kg to the moon later upgrades increased that capacity during the final three apollo lunar missions it deployed about 310000 pounds 140000kg to leo and sent up to 107100lb 48600kg spacecraft to the moon at a height of 363 feet 111m the saturn v was 58 feet 18m taller than the statue of liberty from the ground to the torch and 48 feet 15m taller than the big ben clock tower in contrast the mercury-redstone launch vehicle used on freedom 7 the first manned american spaceflight was just under 11 feet 34m longer than the s-ivb stage and delivered less sea level thrust 78000 pounds-force 350kn than the launch escape system rocket 150000 pounds-force 667kn sea level thrust mounted atop the apollo command module the saturn v was principally designed by the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama although numerous major systems including propulsion were designed by subcontractors it used the powerful new f-1 and j-2 rocket engines for propulsion when tested at stennis space center these engines shattered the windows of nearby houses designers decided early on to attempt to use as much technology from the saturn i program as possible consequently the s-ivb-500 third stage of the saturn v was based on the s-ivb-200 second stage of the saturn ib the instrument unit that controlled the saturn v shared characteristics with that carried by the saturn ib blueprints and other saturn v plans are available on microfilm at the marshall space flight center stages the saturn v consisted of three stagesthe s-ic first stage s-ii second stage and the s-ivb third stageand the instrument unit all three stages used liquid oxygen lox as the oxidizer the first stage used rp-1 for fuel while the second and third stages used liquid hydrogen lh2 the upper stages also used small solid-propellant ullage motors that helped to separate the stages during the launch and to ensure that the liquid propellants were in a proper position to be drawn into the pumps s-ic first stage the s-ic was built by the boeing company at the michoud assembly facility new orleans where the space shuttle external tanks would later be built by lockheed martin most of its mass at launch was propellant rp-1 fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer it was 138 feet 42m tall and 33 feet 10m in diameter and provided over 7600000 pounds-force 34000kn of thrust the s-ic stage had a dry weight of about 289000 pounds 131 metric tons and fully fueled at launch had a total weight of 5100000 pounds 2300 metric tons it was powered by five rocketdyne f-1 engines arrayed in a quincunx five units with four arranged in a square and the fifth in the center the center engine was held in a fixed position while the four outer engines could be hydraulically turned gimballed to steer the rocket in flight the center engine was turned off about 26 seconds earlier than the outboard engines to limit acceleration during launch the s-ic fired its engines for 168 seconds ignition occurred about 89 seconds before liftoff and at engine cutoff the vehicle was at an altitude of about 36 nautical miles 67km was downrange about 50 nautical miles 93km and was moving about 7500 feet per second 2300ms s-ii second stage the s-ii was built by north american aviation at seal beach california using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen it had five rocketdyne j-2 engines in a similar arrangement to the s-ic also using the outer engines for control the s-ii was 816 feet 2487m tall with a diameter of 33 feet 10m identical to the s-ic and thus was the largest cryogenic stage until the launch of the space shuttle in 1981 the s-ii had a dry weight of about 80000 pounds 36000kg and fully fueled weighed 1060000 pounds 480000kg the second stage accelerated the saturn v through the upper atmosphere with 1100000 pounds-force 4900kn of thrust in vacuum when loaded significantly more than 90 percent of the mass of the stage was propellant however the ultra-lightweight design had led to two failures in structural testing instead of having an intertank structure to separate the two fuel tanks as was done in the s-ic the s-ii used a common bulkhead that was constructed from both the top of the lox tank and bottom of the lh2 tank it consisted of two aluminum sheets separated by a honeycomb structure made of phenolic resin this bulkhead had to insulate against the 126f 70c temperature difference between the two tanks the use of a common bulkhead saved 7900 pounds 36t like the s-ic the s-ii was transported from its manufacturing plant to the cape by sea s-ivb third stage the s-ivb was built by the douglas aircraft company at huntington beach california it had one j-2 engine and used the same fuel as the s-ii the s-ivb used a common bulkhead to separate the two tanks it was 586 feet 1786m tall with a diameter of 217 feet 6604m and was also designed with high mass efficiency though not quite as aggressively as the s-ii the s-ivb had a dry weight of about 23000 pounds 10000kg and fully fueled weighed about 262000 pounds 119000kg the s-ivb-500 model used on the saturn v differed from the s-ivb-200 used as the second stage of the saturn ib in that the engine was restartable once per mission this was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission first in a 25 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff and later for the trans-lunar injection tli burn lasting about 6 min two liquid-fueled auxiliary propulsion system aps units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission the two apss were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn the s-ivb was the only rocket stage of the saturn v small enough to be transported by plane in this case the pregnant guppy instrument unit the instrument unit was built by ibm and rode atop the third stage it was constructed at the space systems center in huntsville alabama this computer controlled the operations of the rocket from just before liftoff until the s-ivb was discarded it included guidance and telemetry systems for the rocket by measuring the acceleration and vehicle attitude it could calculate the position and velocity of the rocket and correct for any deviations range safety in the event of an abort requiring the destruction of the rocket the range safety officer would remotely shut down the engines and after several seconds send another command for the shaped explosive charges attached to the outer surfaces of the rocket to detonate these would make cuts in fuel and oxidizer tanks to disperse the fuel quickly and to minimize mixing the pause between these actions would give time for the crew to escape using the launch escape tower or in the later stages of the flight the propulsion system of the service module a third command safe was used after the s-ivb stage reached orbit to irreversibly deactivate the self-destruct system the system was also inactive as long as the rocket was still on the launch pad comparisons titan ii the saturn v had a much lower thrust-to-weight ratio than project geminis titan ii glv richard f gordon jr described saturn as an old mans ride with a lot more shake-rattle-and-roll but milder thrust buzz aldrin and other apollo 11 astronauts agreed that they could not tell when saturn liftoff occurred except from instruments unlike on titan soviet n1-l3 the soviet space programs counterpart to the saturn v was sergei korolevs n1-l3 the saturn v was taller heavier and had greater payload capacity both to low earth orbit and to translunar injection the n-1 was a three-stage launch vehicle with more liftoff thrust and a larger first stage diameter than the saturn v it was to carry the 209000lb 95000kg l3 vehicle into orbit the l3 contained an earth departure stage which would send to the moon a 51800lb 23500kg package which contained another stage for lunar orbit insertion and powered descent initiation a single-cosmonaut lander and a two-cosmonaut lunar orbiter for the return to earth the n1l3 would have produced more total impulse product of thrust and time in its first four stages than the three-stage saturn v but it was not able to convert as much of this into payload momentum product of mass and velocity the n1 never became operational four test launches each resulted in catastrophic vehicle failure early in flight and the program was canceled korolev elected to cluster 30 relatively small engines for the first stage rather than develop a large engine like the rocketdyne f-1 the three-stage saturn v grew over its lifetime to a peak thrust of at least 7650000lbf 34020kn as-510 and subsequent and a lift capacity of 310000lb 140000kg to leo the as-510 mission apollo 15 had a liftoff thrust of 7823000lbf 34800kn the as-513 mission skylab 1 had slightly greater liftoff thrust of 7891000lbf 35100kn by comparison the n-1 had a sea-level liftoff thrust of about 10200000lbf 45400kn no other operational launch vehicle has ever surpassed the saturn v in height weight total impulse or payload capability the closest contenders were the us space shuttle and the soviet energia us space shuttle the space shuttle generated a peak thrust of 6800000lbf 30100kn and payload capacity to leo excluding the orbiter itself was 63500 pounds 28800kg which was about 25 percent of the saturn vs payload total mass in orbit including the orbiter was about 247000lb 112000kg compared to the apollo 15 total orbital mass of the s-ivb third stage and apollo spacecraft of 309771lb 140510kg some 62800lb 28500kg heavier than the shuttle was rated to carry to leo soviet energiaburan energia had a liftoff thrust of 7826000lbf 34810kn and flew twice in 1987 and 1988 the second time as the launcher for the buran shuttle however both the energia and buran programs were cancelled in 1993 hypothetical future versions of energia might have been significantly more powerful than the saturn v delivering 10000000lbf 46000kn of thrust and able to deliver up to 386000lb 175t to leo in the vulkan configuration planned uprated versions of the saturn v using f-1a engines would have had about 18 percent more thrust and 302580 pounds 137250kg payload nasa contemplated building larger members of the saturn family such as the saturn c-8 and also unrelated rockets such as nova but these were never produced other vehicles some other recent us launch vehicles have significantly lower launch capacity to leo than saturn v the us delta 4 heavy capacity is 63470lb 28790kg the atlas v 551 has a capacity of 41478lb 18814kg and the spacex falcon heavy has a capacity of 140700lb 63800kg the european ariane 5 es delivers up to 46000lb 21000kg and the russian proton-m can launch 49000lb 22000kg space launch system nasas space launch system planned for its first flight in 2020 in its final configuration is planned to be 400 feet 120m tall with payload and lift up to 290000 pounds 130000kg into low earth orbit s-ic thrust comparisons because of its large size attention is often focused on the s-ic thrust and how this compares to other large rockets however several factors make such comparisons more complex than first appears commonly referenced thrust numbers are a specification not an actual measurement individual stages and engines may fall short or exceed the specification sometimes significantly the f-1 thrust specification was uprated beginning with apollo 15 sa-510 from 1500000lbf 6670kn to 1520000lbf 6770kn yielding 7610000lbf 33850kn for the s-ic stage the higher thrust was achieved via a redesign of the injector orifices and a slightly higher propellant mass flow rate however comparing the specified number to the actual measured thrust of 7800000lbf 34800kn on apollo 15 shows a significant difference there is no way to directly measure thrust of a rocket in flight rather a mathematical calculation is made from combustion chamber pressure turbopump speed calculated propellant density and flow rate nozzle design and atmospheric pressure thrust varies greatly with external pressure and thus with altitude even for a non-throttled engine for example on apollo 15 the calculated total liftoff thrust based on actual measurements was about 7830000lbf 34810kn which increased to 9200000lbf 40800kn at t135 seconds just before center engine cutoff ceco at which time the jet was heavily underexpanded thrust specifications are often given as vacuum thrust for upper stages or sea level thrust for lower stages or boosters sometimes without qualifying which one this can lead to incorrect comparisons thrust specifications are often given as average thrust or peak thrust sometimes without qualifying which one even for a non-throttled engine at a fixed altitude thrust can often vary somewhat over the firing period due to several factors these include intentional or unintentional mixture ratio changes slight propellant density changes over the firing period and variations in turbopump nozzle and injector performance over the firing period without knowing the exact measurement technique and mathematical method used to determine thrust for each different rocket comparisons are often inexact as the above shows the specified thrust often differs significantly from actual flight thrust calculated from direct measurements the thrust stated in various references is often not adequately qualified as to vacuum vs sea level or peak vs average thrust similarly payload increases are often achieved in later missions independent of engine thrust this is by weight reduction or trajectory reshaping the result is there is no single absolute figure for engine thrust stage thrust or vehicle payload there are specified values and actual flight values and various ways of measuring and deriving those actual flight values the performance of each saturn v launch was extensively analyzed and a launch evaluation report produced for each mission including a thrusttime graph for each vehicle stage on each mission assembly after the construction and ground testing of a stage was completed it was then shipped to the kennedy space center the first two stages were so massive that the only way to transport them was by barge the s-ic constructed in new orleans was transported down the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico after rounding florida it was then transported up the intra-coastal waterway to the vehicle assembly building originally called the vertical assembly building this was essentially the same route which would be used later by nasa to ship space shuttle external tanks the s-ii was constructed in california and thus traveled to florida via the panama canal the third stage and instrument unit could be carried by the aero spacelines pregnant guppy and super guppy but could also have been carried by barge if warranted on arrival at the vertical assembly building each stage was inspected in a horizontal position before being moved to a vertical position nasa also constructed large spool-shaped structures that could be used in place of stages if a particular stage was late these spools had the same height and mass and contained the same electrical connections as the actual stages nasa stacked or assembled the saturn v on a mobile launcher platform mlp which consisted of a launch umbilical tower lut with nine swing arms including the crew access arm a hammerhead crane and a water suppression system which was activated prior to launch after assembly was completed the entire stack was moved from the vab to the launch pad using the crawler transporter ct built by the marion power shovel company and later used for transporting the smaller and lighter space shuttle the ct ran on four double-tracked treads each with 57 shoes each shoe weighed 2000 pounds 910kg this transporter was also required to keep the rocket level as it traveled the 3 miles 48km to the launch site especially at the 3 percent grade encountered at the launch pad the ct also carried the mobile service structure mss which allowed technicians access to the rocket until eight hours before launch when it was moved to the halfway point on the crawlerway the junction between the vab and the two launch pads lunar mission launch sequence the saturn v carried all apollo lunar missions all saturn v missions were launched from launch complex 39 at the john f kennedy space center in florida after the rocket cleared the launch tower flight control transferred to johnson space centers mission control in houston texas an average mission used the rocket for a total of just 20 minutes although apollo 6 experienced three engine failures and apollo 13 one engine shutdown the onboard computers were able to compensate by burning the remaining engines longer to achieve parking orbit none of the saturn v launches resulted in a payload loss s-ic sequence the first stage burned for about 2 minutes and 41 seconds lifting the rocket to an altitude of 42 miles 68km and a speed of 6164 miles per hour 2756ms and burning 4700000 pounds 2100000kg of propellant at 89 seconds before launch the first stage ignition sequence started the center engine ignited first followed by opposing outboard pairs at 300-millisecond intervals to reduce the structural loads on the rocket when thrust had been confirmed by the onboard computers the rocket was soft-released in two stages first the hold-down arms released the rocket and second as the rocket began to accelerate upwards it was slowed by tapered metal pins pulled through dies for half a second once the rocket had lifted off it could not safely settle back down onto the pad if the engines failed the astronauts considered this one of the tensest moments in riding the saturn v for if the rocket did fail to lift off after release they had a low chance of survival given the large amounts of propellant a fully fueled saturn v exploding on the pad would have released the energy equivalent of two kilotons of tnt to improve safety the saturn emergency detection system eds inhibited engine shutdown for the first 30 seconds of flight see saturn v instrument unit it took about 12 seconds for the rocket to clear the tower during this time it yawed 125 degrees away from the tower to ensure adequate clearance despite adverse winds this yaw although small can be seen in launch photos taken from the east or west at an altitude of 430 feet 130m the rocket rolled to the correct flight azimuth and then gradually pitched down until 38 seconds after second stage ignition this pitch program was set according to the prevailing winds during the launch month the four outboard engines also tilted toward the outside so that in the event of a premature outboard engine shutdown the remaining engines would thrust through the rockets center of mass the saturn v reached 400 feet per second 120ms at over 1 mile 1600m in altitude much of the early portion of the flight was spent gaining altitude with the required velocity coming later the saturn v broke the sound barrier at just over 1 minute at an altitude of between 3 and 4 nautical miles 55 to 74 kilometers at this point shock collars or condensation clouds could be seen forming around the bottom of the command module and around the top of the second stage at about 80 seconds the rocket experienced maximum dynamic pressure max q the dynamic pressure on a rocket varies with air density and the square of relative velocity although velocity continues to increase air density decreases so quickly with altitude that dynamic pressure falls below max q acceleration increased during s-ic flight for three reasons one increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines increasing the flow rate somewhat this was the least important factor though this feedback effect often led to an undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo two as it climbed into thinner air f-1 engine efficiency increased significantly a property of all rockets the combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 75 million pounds reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude but the biggest contribution by far was the rockets rapidly decreasing mass the propellant in just the s-ic made up about three-quarters of saturn vs entire launch mass and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second newtons second law states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass so as the mass decreased and the force increased somewhat acceleration rose including gravity launch acceleration was only 1g ie the astronauts felt 1g while the rocket accelerated vertically at g as the rocket rapidly lost mass total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at t135 seconds at this point the inboard center engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g when oxidizer or fuel depletion was sensed in the suction assemblies the remaining four outboard engines were shut down first stage separation occurred a little less than one second after this to allow for f-1 thrust tail-off eight small solid fuel separation motors backed the s-ic from the rest of the vehicle at an altitude of about 36 nautical miles 67km the first stage continued ballistically to an altitude of about 59 nautical miles 109km and then fell in the atlantic ocean about 300 nautical miles 560km downrange the engine shutdown procedure was changed for the launch of skylab to avoid damage to the apollo telescope mount rather than shutting down all four outboard engines at once they were shut down two at a time with a delay to reduce peak acceleration further s-ii sequence after s-ic separation the s-ii second stage burned for 6 minutes and propelled the craft to 109 miles 175km and 15647mph 6995ms close to orbital velocity for the first two unmanned launches eight solid-fuel ullage motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the s-ii stage followed by start of the five j-2 engines for the first seven manned apollo missions only four ullage motors were used on the s-ii and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches about 30 seconds after first stage separation the interstage ring dropped from the second stage this was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage only 1 meter from the outboard j-2 engines would fall cleanly without hitting them as the interstage could have potentially damaged two of the j-2 engines if it was attached to the s-ic shortly after interstage separation the launch escape system was also jettisoned see apollo abort modes for more information about the various abort modes that could have been used during a launch about 38 seconds after the second stage ignition the saturn v switched from a preprogrammed trajectory to a closed loop or iterative guidance mode the instrument unit now computed in real time the most fuel-efficient trajectory toward its target orbit if the instrument unit failed the crew could switch control of the saturn to the command modules computer take manual control or abort the flight about 90 seconds before the second stage cutoff the center engine shut down to reduce longitudinal pogo oscillations at around this time the lox flow rate decreased changing the mix ratio of the two propellants ensuring that there would be as little propellant as possible left in the tanks at the end of second stage flight this was done at a predetermined delta-v five level sensors in the bottom of each s-ii propellant tank were armed during s-ii flight allowing any two to trigger s-ii cutoff and staging when they were uncovered one second after the second stage cut off it separated and several seconds later the third stage ignited solid fuel retro-rockets mounted on the interstage at the top of the s-ii fired to back it away from the s-ivb the s-ii impacted about 2300 nautical miles 4200km from the launch site on the apollo 13 mission the inboard engine suffered from major pogo oscillation resulting in an early automatic cutoff to ensure sufficient velocity was reached the remaining four engines were kept active for longer than planned a pogo suppressor was fitted to later apollo missions to avoid this though the early engine 5 cutoff remained to reduce g-forces s-ivb sequence unlike the two-plane separation of the s-ic and s-ii the s-ii and s-ivb stages separated with a single step although it was constructed as part of the third stage the interstage remained attached to the second stage during apollo 11 a typical lunar mission the third stage burned for about 25 minutes until first cutoff at 11 minutes 40 seconds at this point it was 1430 nautical miles 2650km downrange and in a parking orbit at an altitude of 1032 nautical miles 1911km and velocity of 17432mph 7793ms the third stage remained attached to the spacecraft while it orbited the earth one and a half times while astronauts and mission controllers prepared for translunar injection tli this parking orbit was quite low by earth orbit standards and it would have been short-lived due to aerodynamic drag this was not a problem on a lunar mission because of the short stay in the parking orbit the s-ivb also continued to thrust at a low level by venting gaseous hydrogen to keep propellants settled in their tanks and prevent gaseous cavities from forming in propellant feed lines this venting also maintained safe pressures as liquid hydrogen boiled off in the fuel tank this venting thrust easily exceeded aerodynamic drag for the final three apollo flights the temporary parking orbit was even lower approximately 93 nautical miles 172km to increase payload for these missions the apollo 9 earth orbit mission was launched into the nominal orbit consistent with apollo 11 but the spacecraft were able to use their own engines to raise the perigee high enough to sustain the 10-day mission the skylab was launched into a quite different orbit with a 234-nautical-mile 434km perigee which sustained it for six years and also a higher inclination to the equator 50 degrees versus 325 degrees for apollo on apollo 11 tli came at 2 hours and 44 minutes after launch the s-ivb burned for almost six minutes giving the spacecraft a velocity close to the earths escape velocity of 25053mph 11200ms this gave an energy-efficient transfer to lunar orbit with the moon helping to capture the spacecraft with a minimum of csm fuel consumption about 40 minutes after tli the apollo command service module csm separated from the third stage turned 180 degrees and docked with the lunar module lm that rode below the csm during launch the csm and lm separated from the spent third stage 50 minutes later this process is known as transposition docking and extraction if it were to remain on the same trajectory as the spacecraft the s-ivb could have presented a collision hazard so its remaining propellants were vented and the auxiliary propulsion system fired to move it away for lunar missions before apollo 13 the s-ivb was directed toward the moons trailing edge in its orbit so that the moon would slingshot it beyond earth escape velocity and into solar orbit from apollo 13 onwards controllers directed the s-ivb to hit the moon seismometers left behind by previous missions detected the impacts and the information helped map the interior structure of the moon on september 3 2002 astronomer bill yeung discovered a suspected asteroid which was given the discovery designation j002e3 it appeared to be in orbit around the earth and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide which was a major constituent of the paint used on the saturn v calculation of orbital parameters led to tentative identification as being the apollo 12 s-ivb stage mission controllers had planned to send apollo 12s s-ivb into solar orbit after separating from the apollo spacecraft but it is believed the burn lasted too long and hence did not send it close enough to the moon remaining in a barely stable orbit around the earth and moon in 1971 through a series of gravitational perturbations it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly captured earth orbit 31 years later it left earth orbit again in june 2003 skylab in 1965 the apollo applications program aap was created to look into science missions that could be performed using apollo hardware much of the planning centered on the idea of a space station wernher von brauns earlier 1964 plans employed a wet workshop concept with a spent s-ii saturn v second stage being launched into orbit and outfitted in space the next year aap studied a smaller station using an s-ivb saturn 1b second stage by 1969 apollo funding cuts eliminated the possibility of procuring more apollo hardware and in fact forced the cancellation of some later moon landing flights this freed up at least one saturn v allowing the wet workshop to be replaced with the dry workshop concept the station now known as skylab would be built on the ground from a surplus saturn ib second stage and launched atop the first two live stages of a saturn v a backup station constructed from a saturn v third stage was built and is now on display at the national air and space museum skylab was the only launch not directly related to the apollo lunar landing program the only significant changes to the saturn v from the apollo configurations involved some modification to the s-ii to act as the terminal stage for inserting the skylab payload into earth orbit and to vent excess propellant after engine cutoff so the spent stage would not rupture in orbit the s-ii remained in orbit for almost two years and made an uncontrolled re-entry on january 11 1975 three crews lived aboard skylab from may 25 1973 to february 8 1974 with skylab remaining in orbit until july 11 1979 proposed post-apollo developments after apollo the saturn v was planned to be the prime launch vehicle for prospector intended to land a 330-kilogram 730lb robotic rover on the moon similar to the soviet lunokhod and the voyager mars probes as well a scaled-up version of the voyager interplanetary probes it was also to have been the launch vehicle for the nuclear rocket stage rift test program and the later nerva all of these planned uses of the saturn v were cancelled with cost being a major factor edgar cortright who had been director of nasa langley stated decades later that jpl never liked the big approach they always argued against it i probably was the leading proponent in using the saturn v and i lost probably very wise that i lost the canceled second production run of saturn vs would very likely have used the f-1a engine in its first stage providing a substantial performance boost other likely changes would have been the removal of the fins which turned out to provide little benefit when compared to their weight a stretched s-ic first stage to support the more powerful f-1as and uprated j-2s or an m-1 for the upper stages a number of alternate saturn vehicles were proposed based on the saturn v ranging from the saturn int-20 with an s-ivb stage and interstage mounted directly onto an s-ic stage through to the saturn v-23l which would not only have five f-1 engines in the first stage but also four strap-on boosters with two f-1 engines each giving a total of thirteen f-1 engines firing at launch the space shuttle was initially conceived as a cargo transport to be used in concert with the saturn v even to the point that a saturn-shuttle was proposed using the winged shuttle orbiter and external tank but with the tank mounted on a modified fly-back version of the s-ic the first s-ic stage would be used to power the shuttle during the first two minutes of flight after which the s-ic would be jettisoned which would then fly back to ksc for refurbishment and the space shuttle main engines would then fire and place the orbiter into orbit the shuttle would handle space station logistics while saturn v would launch components lack of a second saturn v production run killed this plan and left the united states without a heavy-lift launch vehicle some in the us space community came to lament this situation as continued production would have allowed the international space station using a skylab or mir configuration with both us and russian docking ports to have been lifted with just a handful of launches the saturn-shuttle concept also would have eliminated the space shuttle solid rocket boosters that ultimately precipitated the challenger accident in 1986 cost from 1964 until 1973 6417 billion equivalent to 33billion in 2016 in total was appropriated for the rd and flights of the saturn v with the maximum being in 1966 with 12 billion equivalent to 695billion in 2016 that same year nasa received its biggest budget of 45 billion about 05 percent of the gross domestic product gdp of the united states at that time one of the main reasons for the cancellation of the last three apollo flights was the cost in the time frame from 1969 to 1971 the cost of launching a saturn v apollo mission was 185000000189000000 of which 110 million was for the production of the vehicle equivalent to 566million in 2016 saturn v vehicles and launches proposed successors us proposals for a rocket larger than the saturn v from the late 1950s through the early 1980s were generally called nova over thirty different large rocket proposals carried the nova name but none was developed wernher von braun and others also had plans for a rocket that would have featured eight f-1 engines in its first stage like the saturn c-8 allowing a direct ascent flight to the moon other plans for the saturn v called for using a centaur as an upper stage or adding strap-on boosters these enhancements would have enabled the launch of large robotic spacecraft to the outer planets or send astronauts to mars other saturn-v derivatives analyzed included the saturn mlv family of modified launch vehicles which would have almost doubled the payload lift capability of the standard saturn v and were intended for use in a proposed mission to mars by 1980 in 1968 boeing studied another saturn-v derivative the saturn c-5n which included a nuclear thermal rocket engine for the third stage of the vehicle the saturn c-5n would carry a considerably greater payload to interplanetary destinations work on the nuclear engines along with all saturn v elvs was ended in 1973 in 2006 as part of the proposed constellation program nasa unveiled plans to construct two shuttle derived launch vehicles the ares i and ares v which would use some existing space shuttle and saturn v hardware and infrastructure the two rockets were intended to increase safety by specializing each vehicle for different tasks ares i for crew launches and ares v for cargo launches the original design of the heavy-lift ares v named in homage to the saturn v was 360ft 110m in height and featured a core stage based on the space shuttle external tank with a diameter of 28ft 84m it was to be powered by five space shuttle main engines ssmes and two five-segment space shuttle solid rocket boosters srbs as the design evolved the ssmes were replaced with five rs-68 engines the same engines used on the delta iv the switch from the ssme to the rs-68 was intended to reduce cost the rs-68 being cheaper simpler to manufacture and more powerful than the ssme though the lower efficiency of the rs-68 required an increase in core stage diameter to 33ft 10m the same diameter as the saturn vs s-ic and s-ii stages in 2008 nasa again redesigned the ares v lengthening the core stage adding a sixth rs-68 engine and increasing the srbs to 55 segments each this vehicle would have been 381ft 116m tall and would have produced a total thrust of approximately 8900000lbf 40mn at liftoff more than the saturn v or the soviet energia but less than the soviet n-1 projected to place approximately 180 metric tons into orbit the ares v would have surpassed the saturn v in payload capability an upper stage the earth departure stage would have utilized a more advanced version of the j-2 engine the j-2x ares v would have placed the altair lunar landing vehicle into low earth orbit an orion crew vehicle launched on ares i would have docked with altair and the earth departure stage would then send the combined stack to the moon after the cancellation of the constellation program and hence ares i and ares v nasa announced the space launch system sls heavy-lift launch vehicle for deep-space exploration the sls similar to the original ares v concept will be powered by four ssmes and two five-segment srbs its block i configuration will lift approximately 70 metric tons to low earth orbit block ib will add a second stage the exploration upper stage powered by four rl10 engines to increase payload to leo and deep space an eventual block ii variant will upgrade to advanced boosters increasing leo payload to at least 130 metric tons one proposal for advanced boosters would use a derivative of the saturn vs f-1 the f-1b and increase sls payload to around 150 metric tons to leo the f-1b is to have better specific impulse and be cheaper than the f-1 with a simplified combustion chamber and fewer engine parts while producing 1800000lbf 80mn of thrust at sea level an increase over the approximate 1550000lbf 69mn achieved by the mature apollo 15 f-1 engine nasa sls deputy project manager jody singer of the marshall space flight center in huntsville in 2012 stated that the vehicle will have a launch cost of approximately 500 million per launch with a relatively minor dependence of costs on launch capability saturn v displays two at the us space rocket center in huntsville sa-500d is on horizontal display made up of s-ic-d s-ii-fd and s-ivb-d these were all test stages not meant for flight this vehicle was displayed outdoors from 1969 to 2007 was restored and is now displayed in the davidson center for space exploration vertical display replica built in 1999 located in an adjacent area one at the johnson space center made up of first stage from sa-514 the second stage from sa-515 and the third stage from sa-513 replaced for flight by the skylab workshop with stages arriving between 1977 and 1979 this was displayed in the open until its 2005 restoration when a structure was built around it for protection this is the only display saturn consisting entirely of stages intended to be launched one at the kennedy space center visitor complex made up of s-ic-t test stage and the second and third stages from sa-514 it was displayed outdoors for decades then in 1996 was enclosed for protection from the elements in the apollosaturn v center the s-ic
