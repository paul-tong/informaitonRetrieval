the gravity of earth denoted by g is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation from distribution of mass within earth and the centrifugal force from the earths rotation in si units this acceleration is measured in metres per second squared in symbols ms or ms or equivalently in newtons per kilogram nkg or nkg near earths surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 98ms which means that ignoring the effects of air resistance the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 98 metres per second every second this quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g in contrast the gravitational constant g is referred to as big g the precise strength of earths gravity varies depending on location the nominal average value at earths surface known as standard gravity is by definition 980665ms this quantity is denoted variously as gn ge though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on earth 978033ms g0 gee or simply g which is also used for the variable local value the weight of an object on earths surface is the downwards force on that object given by newtons second law of motion or f ma force mass acceleration gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration but other factors such as the rotation of earth also contribute and therefore affect the weight of the object gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the moon and sun which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects it is a vector physics quantity whose direction coincides with a plumb bob variation in magnitude a non-rotating perfect sphere of uniform mass density or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre spherical symmetry would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface the earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric rather it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the equator an oblate spheroid there are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface gravity on the earths surface varies by around 07 from 97639ms on the nevado huascarn mountain in peru to 98337ms at the surface of the arctic ocean in large cities it ranges from 97760 in kuala lumpur mexico city and singapore to 9825 in oslo and helsinki conventional value in 1901 the third general conference on weights and measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the earth gn980665ms it was based on measurements done at the pavillon de breteuil near paris in 1888 with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45 at sea level this definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important it is also used to define the units kilogram force and pound force latitude the surface of the earth is rotating so it is not an inertial frame of reference at latitudes nearer the equator the outward centrifugal force produced by earths rotation is larger than at polar latitudes this counteracts the earths gravity to a small degree up to a maximum of 03 at the equator and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects the second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the earths equatorial bulge itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation causes objects at the equator to be farther from the planets centre than objects at the poles because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies the earth and the object being weighed varies inversely with the square of the distance between them an object at the equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles in combination the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9780ms at the equator to about 9832ms at the poles so an object will weigh approximately 05 more at the poles than at the equator altitude gravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the earths surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the earths centre all other things being equal an increase in altitude from sea level to 9000 metres 30000ft causes a weight decrease of about 029 an additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude which lessens an objects buoyancy this would increase a persons apparent weight at an altitude of 9000 metres by about 008 it is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the earths gravity in fact at an altitude of 400 kilometres 250mi equivalent to a typical orbit of the iss gravity is still nearly 90 as strong as at the earths surface weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall the effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground see slab correction section a person flying at 30 000ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea however a person standing on the earths surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher the following formula approximates the earths gravity variation with altitude where gh is the gravitational acceleration at height h above sea level re is the earths mean radius g0 is the standard gravitational acceleration the formula treats the earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below depth an approximate value for gravity at a distance r from the center of the earth can be obtained by assuming that the earths density is spherically symmetric the gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius r all the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the inverse-square law of gravitation another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center thus the gravitational acceleration at this radius is where g is the gravitational constant and mr is the total mass enclosed within radius r if the earth had a constant density the mass would be mr 43r and the dependence of gravity on depth would be g at depth d is given by gg1-dr where g is acceleration due to gravity on surface of the earth d is depth and r is radius of earth if the density decreased linearly with increasing radius from a density 0 at the center to 1 at the surface then r 0 0 1 r re and the dependence would be the actual depth dependence of density and gravity inferred from seismic travel times see adamswilliamson equation is shown in the graphs below local topography and geology local differences in topography such as the presence of mountains geology such as the density of rocks in the vicinity and deeper tectonic structure cause local and regional differences in the earths gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies some of these anomalies can be very extensive resulting in bulges in sea level and throwing pendulum clocks out of synchronisation the study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational geophysics the fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits denser rocks often containing mineral ores cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the earths surface less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite other factors in air or water objects experience a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity as measured by an objects weight the magnitude of the effect depends on the air density and hence air pressure or the water density respectively see apparent weight for details the gravitational effects of the moon and the sun also the cause of the tides have a very small effect on the apparent strength of earths gravity depending on their relative positions typical variations are 2ms 02 mgal over the course of a day variation in direction gravity acceleration is a vector quantity in a spherically symmetric earth gravity would point directly towards the spheres centre as the earth is slightly flatter there are consequently slight deviations in the direction of gravity comparative values worldwide tools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world the effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities anchorage 9826ms helsinki 9825ms being about 05 greater than that in cities near the equator kuala lumpur 9776ms manila 9780ms the effect of altitude can be seen in mexico city 9776ms altitude 2240 metres 7350ft and by comparing denver 9798ms 1616 metres 5302ft with washington dc 9801ms 30 metres 98ft both of which are near 39n measured values can be obtained from physical and mathematical tables by tm yarwood

correction to be applied to the model is the free air correction fac that accounts for heights above sea level near the surface of the earth sea level gravity decreases with height such that linear extrapolation would give zero gravity at a height of one half of the earths radius - 98ms per 3200km using the mass and radius of the earth the fac correction factor g can be derived from the definition of the acceleration due to gravity in terms of g the gravitational constant see estimating g from the law of universal gravitation below where at a height h above the nominal surface of the earth gh is given by so the fac for a height h above the nominal earth radius can be expressed this expression can be readily used for programming or inclusion in a spreadsheet collecting terms simplifying and neglecting small terms hrearth however yields the good approximation using the numerical values above and for a height h in metres grouping the latitude and fac altitude factors the expression most commonly found in the literature is where g h displaystyle gphi h acceleration in ms at latitude displaystyle phi and altitude h in metres slab correction for flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab and we get 2g times the mass per unit area ie 4210mskg 0042galkgm the bouguer correction for a mean rock density of 267 gcm this gives 1110s 011mgalm combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca 2ms 020mgal for every metre of elevation of the terrain the two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 43 times the average density of the whole earth the density of the whole earth is 5515 gcm so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 735 gcm would increase ones weight for the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double bouguer correction with the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite alternatively we can consider a spherically symmetrical earth and subtract from the mass of the earth that of the shell outside the point of observation because that does not cause gravity inside this gives the same result estimating g from the law of universal gravitation from the law of universal gravitation the force on a body acted upon by earths gravity is given by where r is the distance between the centre of the earth and the body see below and here we take m1 to be the mass of the earth and m2 to be the mass of the body additionally newtons second law f ma where m is mass and a is acceleration here tells us that comparing the two formulas it is seen that so to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level substitute the values of the gravitational constant g the earths mass in kilograms m1 and the earths radius in metres r to obtain the value of g note that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body as measured on or above its surface is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre this is what allows us to use the earths radius for r the value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of g the difference may be attributed to several factors mentioned above under variations the earth is not homogeneous the earth is not a perfect sphere and an average value must be used for its radius this calculated value of g only includes true gravity it does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of earth and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force there are significant uncertainties in the values of r and m1 as used in this calculation and the value of g is also rather difficult to measure precisely if g g and r are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the earth this method was used by henry cavendish see also earth sciences portal gravitation portal figure of earth gravity gravitation
