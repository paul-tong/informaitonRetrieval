voyager 1 is a space probe launched by nasa on september 5 1977 part of the voyager program to study the outer solar system voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its twin voyager 2 having operated for 41years 5months and 14days as of february 19 2019 the spacecraft still communicates with the deep space network to receive routine commands and to transmit data to earth at a distance of 14511 astronomical units 2170810km 1348910mi 21708 billion kilometers 13489 billion miles from earth as of february 16 2019 it is the most distant human-made object from earth the probes objectives included flybys of jupiter saturn and saturns largest moon titan while the spacecrafts course could have been altered to include a pluto encounter by forgoing the titan flyby exploration of the moon which was known to have a substantial atmosphere took priority voyager 1 studied the weather magnetic fields and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons after completing its primary mission with the flyby of saturn on november 12 1980 voyager 1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity required to leave the solar system on august 25 2012 voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium in a further testament to the robustness of voyager 1 the voyager team completed a successful test of the spacecrafts trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters in late 2017 the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980 a project enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years voyager 1s extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025 when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments mission background history in the 1960s a grand tour to study the outer planets was proposed which prompted nasa to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s information gathered by the pioneer 10 spacecraft helped voyagers engineers design voyager to cope more effectively with the intense radiation environment around jupiter initially voyager 1 was planned as mariner 11 of the mariner program due to budget cuts the mission was scaled back to be a flyby of jupiter and saturn and renamed the mariner jupiter-saturn probes as the program progressed the name was later changed to voyager since the probe designs began to differ greatly from previous mariner missions spacecraft components voyager 1 was constructed by the jet propulsion laboratory it has 16 hydrazine thrusters three-axis stabilization gyroscopes and referencing instruments to keep the probes radio antenna pointed toward earth collectively these instruments are part of the attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters the spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space communication system the radio communication system of voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the solar system the communication system includes a 37-meter 12ft diameter high gain cassegrain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three deep space network stations on the earth the craft normally transmits data to earth over deep space network channel 18 using a frequency of either 23ghz or 84ghz while signals from earth to voyager are transmitted at 21ghz when voyager 1 is unable to communicate directly with the earth its digital tape recorder dtr can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time signals from voyager 1 take over 19 hours to reach earth power voyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs mounted on a boom each mhw-rtg contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres the rtgs generated about 470 w of electric power at the time of launch with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat the power output of the rtgs declines over time due to the 877-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples but the crafts rtgs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025 diagram of rtg fuel container showing the plutonium-238 oxide spheres diagram of rtg fuel container showing the plutonium-238 oxide spheres diagram of rtg shell

2019 voyager 1 has 7206 of the plutonium-238 that it had at launch by 2050 it will have 565 left computers unlike the other onboard instruments the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers the flight data subsystem fds since the 1990s most space probes have had completely autonomous cameras the computer command subsystem ccs controls the cameras the ccs contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding fault-detection and -correction routines antenna pointing routines and spacecraft sequencing routines this computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the 1970s viking orbiters the hardware in both custom-built ccs subsystems in the voyagers is identical there is only a minor software modification one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks the attitude and articulation control subsystem aacs controls the spacecraft orientation its attitude it keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the earth controls attitude changes and points the scan platform the custom-built aacs systems on both voyagers are the same scientific instruments for more details on the voyager space probes identical instrument packages see the separate article on the overall voyager program voyager 1 in a space simulator

air force station aboard a titan iiie launch vehicle the voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier on august 20 1977 despite being launched later voyager 1 reached both jupiter and saturn sooner following a shorter trajectory flyby of jupiter voyager 1 began photographing jupiter in january 1979 its closest approach to jupiter was on march 5 1979 at a distance of about 349000 kilometers 217000 miles from the planets center because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach most observations of the moons rings magnetic fields and the radiation belt environment of the jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach voyager 1 finished photographing the jovian system in april 1979 discovery of active volcanic activity on the moon io was probably the greatest surprise it was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the solar system it appears that activity on io affects the entire jovian system io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the jovian magnetosphere the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planets strong magnetic field sulfur oxygen and sodium apparently erupted by ios volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles were detected at the outer edge of the magnetosphere of jupiter the two voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about jupiter its satellites its radiation belts and its never-before-seen planetary rings play media voyager 1 time-lapse movie of jupiter approach

trajectories at jupiter were successfully carried out by both voyagers and the two spacecraft went on to visit saturn and its system of moons and rings voyager 1 encountered saturn in november 1980 with the closest approach on november 12 1980 when the space probe came within 124000 kilometers 77000mi of saturns cloud-tops the space probes cameras detected complex structures in the rings of saturn and its remote sensing instruments studied the atmospheres of saturn and its giant moon titan voyager 1 found that about seven percent of the volume of saturns upper atmosphere is helium compared with 11 percent of jupiters atmosphere while almost all the rest is hydrogen since saturns internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as jupiters and the suns the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through saturns hydrogen that might explain the excess heat that saturn radiates over energy it receives from the sun winds blow at high speeds in saturn near the equator the voyagers measured winds about 500ms 1100mph the wind blows mostly in an easterly direction the voyagers found aurora-like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere and auroras at polar latitudes above 65 degrees the high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator the mid-latitude auroras which occur only in sunlit regions remain a puzzle since bombardment by electrons and ions known to cause auroras on earth occurs primarily at high latitudes both voyagers measured the rotation of saturn the length of a day at 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds voyager 1s mission included a flyby of titan saturns largest moon which had long been known to have an atmosphere images taken by pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex further increasing interest the titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to saturn compromising observations and approached to within 6400km 4000mi passing behind titan as seen from earth and the sun voyagers measurement of the atmospheres effect on sunlight and earth-based measurement of its effect on the probes radio signal were used to determine the atmospheres composition density and pressure titans mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probes trajectory the thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface but the measurement of the atmospheres composition temperature and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface because observations of titan were considered vital the trajectory chosen for voyager 1 was designed around the optimum titan flyby which took it below the south pole of saturn and out of the plane of the ecliptic ending its planetary science mission had voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe titan voyager 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the titan flyby precluding any visit to uranus and neptune the trajectory voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to uranus and neptune but could have been altered to avoid a titan flyby and travel from saturn to pluto arriving in 1986 crescent saturn from 53million km four days after closest approach crescent

exit from the heliosphere on february 14 1990 voyager 1 took the first ever family portrait of the solar system as seen from outside which includes the image of planet earth known as pale blue dot soon afterwards its cameras were deactivated to conserve energy and computer resources for other equipment the camera software has been removed from the spacecraft so it would now be complex to get them working again earth-side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available on february 17 1998 voyager 1 reached a distance of 69 au from the sun and overtook pioneer 10 as the most distant spacecraft from earth travelling at about 17 kilometers per second 11mis it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft as voyager 1 headed for interstellar space its instruments continued to study the solar system jet propulsion laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard voyager 1 and 2 to look for the heliopause the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium as of 2013 the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the sun of about 17030 meters per second 55900fts with the velocity the probe is currently maintaining voyager 1 is traveling about 325million miles 52310 km per year or approximately half a light-year per ten millennia termination shock scientists at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory believe that voyager 1 entered the termination shock in february 2003 this marks the point where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds some other scientists expressed doubt discussed in the journal nature of november 6 2003 the issue would not be resolved until other data became available since voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990 this failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board in may 2005 a nasa press release said that the consensus was that voyager 1 was then in the heliosheath in a scientific session at the american geophysical union meeting in new orleans on may 25 2005 dr ed stone presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004 this event is estimated to have occurred on december 15 2004 at a distance of 94 au from the sun heliosheath on march 31 2006 amateur radio operators from amsat in germany tracked and received radio waves from voyager 1 using the 20-meter 66ft dish at bochum with a long integration technique retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the deep space network station at madrid spain this seems to be the first such amateur tracking of voyager 1 it was confirmed on december 13 2010 that voyager 1 had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind as measured by the low energy charged particle device it is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere since june 2010 detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero providing conclusive evidence of the event on this date the spacecraft was approximately 116 au or 108billion miles 173billion kilometers from the sun voyager 1 was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space on march 2011 33yr 6mo from launch a test roll done in february had confirmed the spacecrafts ability to maneuver and reorient itself the course of the spacecraft was not changed it rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to earth to detect the solar wind this was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the family portrait photograph of the planets was taken in 1990 after the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with alpha centauri voyager 1s guide star and it resumed sending transmissions back to earth voyager 1 was expected to enter interstellar space at any time voyager 2 was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as voyager 1 the spacecraft was reported at 1244 declination and 17163 hours right ascension and at an ecliptic latitude of 349 the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly placing it in the constellation ophiuchus as observed from the earth on may 21 2011 on december 1 2011 it was announced that voyager 1 had detected the first lyman-alpha radiation originating from the milky way galaxy lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies but because of interference from the sun the radiation from the milky way was not detectable nasa announced on december 5 2011 that voyager 1 had entered a new region referred to as a cosmic purgatory within this stagnation region charged particles streaming from the sun slow and turn inward and the solar systems magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure energetic particles originating in the solar system decline by nearly half while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold the inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 au from the sun heliopause nasa announced in june 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the sun the craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the solar system voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in august 2012 then at a distance of 121 au from the sun although this was not confirmed for another year as of september 2012 sunlight took 1689 hours to get to voyager 1 which was at a distance of 121 au the apparent magnitude of the sun from the spacecraft was 163 less than 30 times the brightness of the full moon the spacecraft was traveling at 17043kms 10590mis relative to the sun it would need about 17565 years at this speed to travel a light-year to compare proxima centauri the closest star to the sun is about 42 light-years 701639643435735500026510au distant were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star 73775 years would pass before voyager 1 reaches it voyager 1 is heading in the direction of the constellation ophiuchus in late 2012 researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since may in collisions with high energy particles above 70 mev which are thought to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the solar system with a sharp increase in these collisions in late august at the same time in late august there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles which are thought to originate from the sun ed roelof space scientist at johns hopkins university and principal investigator for the low-energy charged particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that most scientists involved with voyager 1 would agree that these two criteria have been sufficiently satisfied however the last criterion for officially declaring that voyager 1 had crossed the boundary the expected change in magnetic field direction from that of the sun to that of the interstellar field beyond had not been observed the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged on december 3 2012 voyager project scientist ed stone of the california institute of technology said voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there were still inside apparently but the magnetic field now is connected to the outside so its like a highway letting particles in and out the magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock it was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the solar system completely and entered interstellar space in march 2013 it was announced that voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on august 25 2012 however until september 12 2013 it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the solar system at that time the former alternative was officially confirmed in 2013 voyager 1 was exiting the solar system at a speed of about 36 au per year while voyager 2 is going slower leaving the solar system at 33 au per year each year voyager 1 increases its lead over voyager 2 voyager 1 reached a distance of 135 au from the sun on may 18 2016 by september 5 2017 that had increased to about 13964 au from the sun or just over 19 light-hours and at that time voyager 2 was 11532 au from the sun its progress can be monitored at nasas website see external links interstellar medium on september 12 2013 nasa officially confirmed that voyager 1 had reached the interstellar medium in august 2012 as previously observed with a generally accepted date of august 25 2012 10d short of 34yrs since launch the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected by this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found a key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on april 9 2013 triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in march 2012 electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within weaker sets of oscillations measured in october and november 2012 provided additional data an indirect measurement was required because voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980 in september 2013 nasa released recordings of audio transductions of these plasma waves the first to be measured in interstellar space while voyager 1 is commonly spoken of as having left the solar system simultaneously with having left the heliosphere the two are not the same the solar system is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the sun the craft is presently less than one-seventh the distance to the aphelion of sedna and it has not yet entered the oort cloud the source region of long-period comets regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the solar system future of the probe voyager 1 is expected to reach the theorized oort cloud in about 300 years and take about 30000 years to pass through it though it is not heading towards any particular star in about 40000 years it will pass within 16 light-years of the star gliese 445 which is at present in the constellation camelopardalis that star is generally moving towards the solar system at about 119kms 430000kmh 270000mph nasa says that the voyagers are destinedperhaps eternallyto wander the milky way provided voyager 1 does not collide with anything and is not retrieved the new horizons space probe will never pass it despite being launched from earth at a faster speed than either voyager spacecraft the voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple planetary flybys to increase their heliocentric velocities whereas new horizons received only a single such boost from its jupiter flyby as of 2018 new horizons is traveling at about 14 kms 3 kms slower than voyager 1 and is still slowing down in december 2017 it was announced that nasa had successfully fired up all four of voyager 1s trajectory correction maneuver tcm thrusters the tcm thrusters will be used in the place of a degraded set of jets which were used to help keep the probes antenna pointed towards the earth use of the tcm thrusters will allow voyager 1 to continue to transmit data to nasa for two to three more years golden record each voyager
