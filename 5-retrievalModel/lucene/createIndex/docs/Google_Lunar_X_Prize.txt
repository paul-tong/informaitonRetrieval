the google lunar xprize glxp sometimes referred to as moon 20 was a 20072018 inducement prize space competition organized by the x prize foundation and sponsored by google the challenge called for privately funded teams to be the first to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon travel 500 meters and transmit back to earth high-definition video and images the original deadline was the end of 2014 with enhanced prize money for a landing by 2012 in 2015 xprize announced that the competition deadline would be extended to december 2017 if at least one team could secure a verified launch contract by 31 december 2015 two teams secured such a launch contract and the deadline was extended in august 2017 the deadline was extended again to 31 march 2018 entering 2018 five teams remained in the competition spaceil moon express synergy moon team indus and team hakuto having secured verified launch contracts with spaceflight industries rocket lab interorbital systems and isro jointly for the last two teams on 23 january 2018 the x prize foundation announced that no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the moon by the 31 march 2018 deadline and the us30 million google lunar xprize will go unclaimed on 5 april 2018 the x prize foundation announced that the lunar xprize would continue as a non-cash competition competition summary the google lunar xprize was announced at the wired nextfest on 13 september 2007 the competition offered a total of us30million in prizes to the first privately funded teams to land a robot on the moon that successfully travels more than 500 meters 1640ft and transmits back high-definition images and video the first team to do so would have claimed the us20million grand prize while the second team to accomplish the same tasks would have been awarded a us5million second prize teams also earned additional money by completing additional tasks beyond the baseline requirements required to win the grand or second prize such as traveling ten times the baseline requirements greater than 5000 meters 3mi capturing images of the remains of apollo program hardware or other man-made objects on the moon verifying from the lunar surface the recent detection of water ice on the moon or surviving a lunar night additionally a us1million diversity award was to be given to teams that make significant strides in promoting ethnic diversity in stem fields to provide an added incentive for teams to complete their missions quickly it was announced that the prize would decrease from us20million to us15million whenever a government-led mission lands on and explores the lunar surface however in november 2013 the organizers and the teams agreed to drop this rule as the launch of the chinese change 3 probewhich landed on the moon in december 2013approached in 2015 xprize announced that the competition deadline would be extended to december 2017 if at least one team could secure a verified launch contract by 31 december 2015 two teams secured such a launch contract and the deadline was extended xprize announced 5 finalists on 24 january 2017 spaceil moon express synergy moon team indus and hakuto having secured verified launch contracts for 2017 with spacex rocket lab interorbital systems and isro respectively all other teams had until the end of 2016 to secure a verified launch contract but failed to meet this deadline the google lunar xprize expired on 31 march 2018 as none of the five final teams were able to launch their vehicles by the deadline another extension of the deadline was ruled out by google and the prize went unclaimed overview peter diamandis the project founder wrote on the official web page in 2007 the goal of the google lunar x prize was similar to that of the ansari x prize to inspire a new generation of private investment in hopes of developing more cost-effective technologies and materials to overcome many limitations of space exploration that are currently taken for granted history the google lunar xprize was announced in 2007 origin of the prize similar to the way in which the ansari xprize was formed the google lunar xprize was created out of a former venture of peter diamandis to achieve a similar goal dr diamandis served as ceo of blastoff corporation a commercial initiative to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon as a mix of entertainment internet and space although it was ultimately unsuccessful the blastoff initiative paved the way for the google lunar x prize initially nasa was the planned sponsor and the prize purse was just us20million as nasa is a federal agency of the united states government and thus funded by us tax money the prize would only have been available to teams from the united states the original intention was to propose the idea to other national space agencies including the european space agency and the japanese space agency in the hope that they would offer similar prize purses however budget setbacks stopped nasa from sponsoring the prize peter diamandis then presented the idea to larry page and sergey brin co-founders of google at an xprize fundraiser they agreed to sponsor it and also to increase the prize purse to us30million allowing for a second place prize as well as bonus prizes extensions of the deadline the prize was originally announced in 2007 as a contest to put a robotic rover on the moon by 2012 with a 20million prize to the winner if the landing was achieved by 2012 the prize decreased to 15m until the end of 2014 at which point the contest would conclude the five-year deadline was optimistic about schedule jeff foust commented in space review that as the end of 2012 approached no team appeared that close to mounting a reasonable bid to win it in 2010 the deadline was extended by one year with the prize to expire at the end of december 2015 and the reduction of the grand prize from 20million to 15million changed from originally 2012 to if a government mission successfully lands on the lunar surface on 16 december 2014 xprize announced another extension in the prize deadline from 31 december 2015 to 31 december 2016 in may 2015 the foundation announced another extension of the deadline the deadline for winning the prize was now december 2017 but contingent on at least one team showing by 31 december 2015 that they have a secured contract for launch on 9 october 2015 team spaceil announced their officially verified launch contract with spacex therefore extending the competition until the end of 2017 on 16 august 2017 the deadline was extended again to 31 march 2018 none of the remaining teams were be able to claim the google x-prize money due to the inability to launch before the final deadline objections to the heritage bonus prizes some observers have raised objections to the inclusion of the two heritage bonus prizes particularly the apollo heritage bonus prize which was to award an additional estimated us1million to the first group that successfully delivers images and videos of the landing site of one of the apollo program landing sites such as tranquility base after landing on the lunar surface such sites are widely regarded as archaeologically and culturally significant and some have expressed concern that a team attempting to win this heritage bonus might inadvertently damage or destroy such a site either during the landing phase of the mission or by piloting a rover around the site as a result some archaeologists went on record calling for the foundation to cancel the heritage bonus and to ban groups from targeting landing zones within 100 kilometers 62mi of previous sites in turn the foundation noted that as part of the competitions educational goals these bonuses fostered debate about how to respectfully visit previous lunar landing sites but that it does not see itself as the appropriate adjudicator of such an internationally relevant and interdisciplinary issue this response left detractors unsatisfied the foundation pointed to the historical precedent set by the apollo 12 mission which landed nearby the previous surveyor 3 robotic probe pete conrad and alan bean approached and inspected surveyor 3 and even removed some parts from it to be returned to earth for study new scientific results from that heritage visit on the exposure of manmade objects to conditions in outer space were still being published in leading papers nearly four decades later however as surveyor 3 and apollo 12 were both nasa missions there was no controversy at the time in january 2011 nasas manager for lunar commercial space noted on twitter that work was underway to provide insight and guidelines on how lunar heritage sites could be protected while still allowing visitations that could yield critical science and in july 2011 nasa issued recommendations to space-faring entities how to protect and preserve the historic and scientific value of us government lunar artifacts these guidelines were developed with the assistance of beth oleary an anthropology professor at new mexico state university in las cruces and a recognized leader in the emerging field of space archaeology however these are only guidelines and recommendations and are not enforceable beyond the possibility of moral sanctions an organization called for all moonkind inc is now working to develop an international treaty that will include enforceable provisions designed to manage access to the apollo sites and protect and preserve those sites as well as others on the moon as the common heritage of all humankind nevertheless some of the apollo astronauts themselves have expressed support for the bonus with apollo 11 moonwalker buzz aldrin appearing at the google lunar xprizes initial announcement and reading a plaque signed by the majority of his fellow surviving apollo astronauts prize not won on 23 january 2018 the x prize foundation announced that no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the moon by the 31 march 2018 deadline and the us30 million google lunar xprize will go unclaimed competitors registration in the google lunar x prize closed by 31 december 2010 the complete roster of 32 teams was announced in february 2011 by january 2017 there were just five officially registered google lunar x prize teams continuing to pursue the prize objectives as other teams had left the competition entirely failed to achieve a competition interim milestone or merged with other teams initially 32 teams were registered with 16 teams having actively participated in all activities and only 5 teams satisfying the rule requiring a verified launch contract by 31 december 2016 shortly after the announcement of the complete roster of teams an x prize foundation official noted that a total of thirty one teams entered a partial registration program by filing a letter of intent to compete of these twenty did indeed register or join other registered teams while eleven ultimately did not register terrestrial milestone prizes overview in november 2013 the x-prize organization announced that several milestone prizes will be awarded to teams for demonstrating key technologies prior to the actual mission a total of us6 million was awarded throughout 2014 for achieving the following milestones 1million for up to 3 teams for the lander system milestone prize to demonstrate hardware and software that enables a soft-landing on the moon 500000 for up to 4 teams for the mobility subsystem milestone prize to demonstrate a mobility system that allows the craft to move 500 meters after landing 250000 for up to 4 teams for the imaging subsystem milestone prize for producing mooncasts consisting of high-quality images and video on the lunar surface selected teams in february 2014 a judging panel selected five teams which could compete for several interim prizes based on their proposals to achieve particular goals the teams and their ultimate awards were the five selected teams were required to accomplish the milestones outlined in their submissions through testing and mission simulations in order to be awarded the interim prizes the teams had until october 2014 to complete the prize requirements the winners were officially awarded on 26 january 2015 in san francisco teams with confirmed launch contracts as of the end of 2016 teams were required to have verified launch contracts by the end of 2016 in order to remain in the competition although the contest ended without a winner some of these teams have expressed an intention to launch in the future other teams three competitors who were unable to get a verified launch contract by 31 december 2016 disqualifying them from the competition are also still planning to launch their crafts
