the warmhot intergalactic medium whim refers to a sparse warm-to-hot 10 to 10 k plasma that cosmologists believe to exist in the spaces between galaxies and to contain 4050 of the baryons that is normal matter which exists as plasma or as atoms and molecules in contrast to dark matter in the universe at the current epoch it can be described as a web of hot diffuse gas much of what is known about the warmhot intergalactic medium comes from computer simulations of the cosmos the whim is expected to form a filamentary structure of tenuous highly ionized baryons with a density of 110 particles per cubic meter within the whim gas shocks are created as a result of active galactic nuclei along with the gravitationally-driven processes of merging and accretion part of the gravitational energy supplied by these effects is converted into thermal emissions of the matter by collisionless shock heating because of the high temperature of the medium the expectation is that it is most easily observed from the absorption or emission of ultraviolet and low energy x-ray radiation to locate the whim researchers examined x-ray observations of a rapidly growing super massive black hole known as an active galactic nucleus or agn oxygen atoms in the whim were seen to absorb x-rays passing through the medium in may 2010 a giant reservoir of whim was detected by the chandra x-ray observatory lying along the wall-shaped structure of galaxies sculptor wall some 400 million light-years from earth see also intergalactic medium intracluster medium
