emperor huan of han chinese pinyin hn han d wadegiles han huan-ti 132 25 january 168 was the 27th emperor of the han dynasty after he was enthroned by the empress dowager and her brother liang ji on 1 august 146 he was a great-grandson of emperor zhang after emperor zhi was poisoned to death by the powerful official liang ji in 146 liang ji persuaded his sister the regent empress dowager liang to make the 14-year-old liu zhi the marquess of liwu who was betrothed to their sister liang nying emperor as the years went by emperor huan offended by liang jis autocratic and violent nature became determined to eliminate the liang family with the help of eunuchs emperor huan succeeded in removing liang ji in 159 but this only caused an increase in the influence of these eunuchs over all aspects of the government corruption during this period had reached a boiling point in 166 university students rose up in protest against the government and called on emperor huan to eliminate all corrupt officials instead of listening emperor huan ordered the arrest of all students involved emperor huan has largely been viewed as an emperor who might have had some intelligence but lacked wisdom in governing his empire and his reign contributed greatly to the downfall of the eastern han dynasty hou hanshu history of the later han recounts that one roman envoy perhaps sent by emperor marcus aurelius reached the chinese capital luoyang in 166 and was greeted by emperor huan emperor huan died in 168 after reigning for 22 years he was 36 he was succeeded by emperor ling of han family background and ascension liu zhi was born in 132 to liu yi the marquess of liwu and his concubine yan ming liu yi was the son of liu kai the prince of hejian and therefore a grandson of emperor zhang and he had initially been made the prince of pingyuan as the heir of his cousin liu sheng by empress dowager deng sui the regent for emperor an who was impressed with his abilities that led to rumors that empress deng was looking to replace emperor an prince yis cousin with prince yi after empress dowager deng died in 121 emperor an bearing a grudge against prince yi demoted him to the rank of marquess of duxiang and exiled him to his fathers principality during the reign of emperor shun prince kai requested that he be allowed to give liwu county part of his principality to his son and emperor shun permitted it marquess yi thus became the marquess of liwu by 146 liu zhi had inherited his fathers title and was betrothed to liang nying the younger sister of the regent empress dowager liang na and her violent and corrupt brother grand marshal liang ji that year liang ji bearing a grudge against the eight-year-old emperor zhi for calling him an arrogant general murdered the young emperor by poison the officials largely favored emperor zhis first cousin liu suan the prince of qinghe who was described as a solemn and proper man prince suans age was not given in history though he appeared to be an adult by this time however liang ji was hesitant to yield authority to an able emperor because marquess zhi was betrothed to his sister and relatively young liang ji felt that he could control him and insisted on making him emperor marquess zhi took the throne later that year as emperor huan early reign under liang jis shadow after emperor huans ascension at age 14 empress dowager liang continued to serve as regent however her brother liang ji came to take on more and more control even more than the empress dowager emperor huan posthumously honored his grandfather and father as emperors but because the empress dowager was regent did not honor his mother yan ming as an empress dowager rather she was given the title of an imperial consort his fathers wife lady ma was belatedly honored as an imperial consort as well in 148 in 147 he married empress dowager liang and liang jis sister liang nying making her empress it appeared that while the liangs were in control emperor huan was not a complete puppet instead as a sign of bad things to come he trusted eunuchs in his decision-making that same year liang ji in conjunction with the eunuchs tang heng and zuo guan but with emperor huans clear approval falsely accused the honest officials li gu and du qiao of conspiring to overthrow emperor huan and replace him with prince suan li and du were executed while prince suan was demoted to marquess status and committed suicide in 150 empress dowager liang announced that she was retiring and returning imperial authority to emperor huan later that year she died emperor huan then honored his mother as an empress dowager however without his sister to curb his power liang ji came to be even more powerful than before his violence and corruption increased and he stamped out all dissent with threats of death he even threw his humble and peace-loving brother liang buyi out of the government in 152 empress dowager yan died because emperor huan had inherited the throne through a collateral line he was not permitted by customs to be the mourner instead his brother liu shi the prince of pingyuan served as chief mourner in 153 the first major public confrontation between an official and a powerful eunuch occurredforeshadowing many to come zhu mu the governor of ji province modern central and northern hebei had found out that the father of the powerful eunuch zhao zhong had been improperly buried in a jade vest an honor that was reserved to imperial princes he ordered an investigation zhaos father was exhumed and the jade vest was stripped away an act that angered zhao and emperor huan zhu was not only removed from his post but was sentenced to hard labor coup detat against liang ji as the years went by emperor huan became increasingly disgruntled at liang jis control of the government and was also angered by empress liangs behavior because of her position as empress dowager liang and liang jis sister empress liang was wasteful in her luxurious living far exceeding any past empress and was exceedingly jealous she did not have a son and because she did not want any other imperial consorts to have sons she would find some way to murder pregnant consorts emperor huan did not dare to react to her due to liang jis power but rarely had sexual relations with her in 159 angry and depressed that she had lost her husbands favor empress liang died this death started a chain of events that led to liang jis downfall later that year liang in order to continue to control emperor huan had adopted his wifes beautiful cousin the stepdaughter of her uncle liang ji note different characters despite the same pronunciation deng mengn as his own daughter changing her family name to liang he and sun gave liang mengn to emperor huan as an imperial consort after empress liangs death they hoped that she would eventually be made empress to completely control her liang ji planned to have her mother lady xuan killed he sent assassins against her but the assassination was foiled by the powerful eunuch yuan she a neighbor of lady xuan lady xuan reported the assassination attempt to emperor huan who was greatly angered he entered into a conspiracy with eunuchs tang heng zuo guan dan chao xu huang and ju yuan to overthrow liangsealing the oath by biting open dans arm and swearing by his blood liang ji had some suspicions about what emperor huan and the eunuchs were up to and began an investigation the five eunuchs quickly reacted they had emperor huan openly announce that he was taking back power from liang ji and mobilized the imperial guards to defend the palace against a counterattack by liang they surrounded liangs house and forced him to surrender liang and sun were unable to respond and committed suicide the entire liang and sun clans except for liang jis brothers li buyi and liang meng who had previously already died were arrested and slaughtered a large number of officials were executed or deposed for close association with liangso many that the government was almost unable to function for some time liang and suns properties were confiscated by the imperial treasury which allowed the taxes to be reduced by 50 for one year the people greatly celebrated liang jis death late reign empowerment of the eunuchs after liang jis death emperor huan made liang mengn empress however he disliked her family name and therefore ordered her to take the family name bo he later found out that her original family name was actually deng and therefore had her family name restored the people had great expectations for emperor huans administration after the death of liang ji however having been unable to overthrow liang ji without the five eunuchs help emperor huan greatly rewarded them making them and several other eunuchs who participated in the coup dtat marquesses and further giving them governmental posts that conferred tremendous power further the five eunuch-marquesses openly engaged in massive corruption and became extremely wealthy with emperor huans approval a song written about the four remaining eunuch-marquesses following dans death described them in this way emperor huan himself was also corrupt and unwilling to accept any criticism in 159 when the honest county magistrate li yun submitted a petition urging him to curb the power of the eunuchs emperor huan was deeply offended that he included the phrase is the emperor turning blind and despite intercessions by a number of officials and even some fairly-minded eunuchs had li and his friend du zhong both executed in 161 apparently in reaction to spending due to renewed qiang rebellions and new agrarian revolts emperor huan issued an edict offering minor offices for saleincluding imperial guard officer positions this practice set a bad precedent and would become even more prevalent and problematic under emperor huans successor emperor ling while emperor huan actually was able to find competent generals to suppress the rebellions or to persuade the rebels to surrender the rampant corruption came to cause new rebellions as soon as the old ones are quelled in 165 perhaps finally fed up with the eunuchs excess emperor huan demoted ju the only eunuch remaining of the original five several other corrupt eunuchs were also demoted or deposed however soon thereafter the eunuchs powers were restored again for the rest of emperor huans reign there would be a cycle of rise and fall of power of the eunuchs after conflicts with officials but inexorably the eunuchs would return becoming more powerful than before later that year apparently tired of empress deng and sick of her disputes with a favorite consort of his consort guo emperor huan deposed and imprisoned her she died in anger and several of her family members were executed he wanted to make another consort tian sheng empress but officials opposed this on the basis that she was of lowly birth they recommended that he make consort dou miao the daughter of dou wu a confucian scholar and a descendant of dou rong who had contributed much to the establishment of the eastern han dynasty empress even though he did not favor consort dou emperor huan gave in to pressure and made her empress in 166 a major public confrontation between university students and eunuchs evolved into a major incident the governor of the capital province modern western henan and central shaanxi li ying had arrested and executed a fortuneteller named zhang cheng who had had his son kill a man having predicted that a general pardon was coming li was arrested and 200 some university students signed a petition requesting his release this further angered emperor huan who had the students arrested only after about a year and dou wus intercession were li and the university students released but all of them had their citizenship rights stripped this incident was later known as the first disaster of partisan prohibition in 168 emperor huan died without a son empress dou jealous of how he favored consort tian had her immediately put to death she conducted a survey among the members of the imperial clan and decided on the 11-year-old liu hong the marquess of jieduting
