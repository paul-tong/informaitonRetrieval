wernher magnus maximilian freiherr von braun march 23 1912 june 16 1977 was a german-american aerospace engineer and space architect he was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in germany and a pioneer of rocket technology and space science in the united states while in his twenties and early thirties von braun worked in nazi germanys rocket development program he helped design and develop the v-2 rocket at peenemnde during world war ii following the war he was secretly moved to the united states along with about 1600 other german scientists engineers and technicians as part of operation paperclip he worked for the united states army on an intermediate-range ballistic missile irbm program and he developed the rockets that launched the united states first space satellite explorer 1 his group was assimilated into nasa where he served as director of the newly formed marshall space flight center and as the chief architect of the saturn v super heavy-lift launch vehicle that propelled the apollo spacecraft to the moon in 1975 von braun received the national medal of science he advocated a human mission to mars early life wernher von braun was born on march 23 1912 in the small town of wirsitz in the posen province in what was then the german empire and is now poland he was the second of three sons he belonged to a noble lutheran family and from birth he held the title of freiherr equivalent to baron the german nobilitys legal privileges were abolished in 1919 although noble titles could still be used as part of the family name his father magnus freiherr von braun 18781972 was a civil servant and conservative politician he served as minister of agriculture in the federal government during the weimar republic his mother emmy von quistorp 18861959 traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval european royalty and was a descendant of philip iii of france valdemar i of denmark robert iii of scotland and edward iii of england wernher had an older brother the west german diplomat sigismund von braun who served as secretary of state in the foreign office in the 1970s and a younger brother also named magnus von braun who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with chrysler after wernhers confirmation his mother gave him a telescope and he developed a passion for astronomy the family moved to berlin in 1915 where his father worked at the ministry of the interior here in 1924 the 12-year-old wernher inspired by speed records established by max valier and fritz von opel in rocket-propelled cars caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached fireworks he was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to get him wernher learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer he took lessons from the composer paul hindemith the few pieces of wernhers youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of hindemiths style he could play piano pieces of beethoven and bach from memory beginning in 1925 wernher attended a boarding school at ettersburg castle near weimar where he did not do well in physics and mathematics there he acquired a copy of by rocket into planetary space die rakete zu den planetenrumen 1923 by rocket pioneer hermann oberth in 1928 his parents moved him to the hermann-lietz-internat also a residential school on the east frisian north sea island of spiekeroog space travel had always fascinated wernher and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering in 1930 von braun attended the technische hochschule berlin where he joined the spaceflight society verein fr raumschiffahrt or vfr and assisted willy ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with hermann oberth in spring 1932 he graduated from the technische hochschule berlin now technical university of berlin with a diploma in mechanical engineering his early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology wanting to learn more about physics chemistry and astronomy von braun entered the friedrich-wilhelm university of berlin for post-graduate studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 1934 he also studied at eth zrich for a term from june to october 1931 although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there space travel remained his primary interest in 1930 von braun attended a presentation given by auguste piccard after the talk the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight and stated to him you know i plan on traveling to the moon at some time piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words von braun was greatly influenced by oberth of whom he said hermann oberth was the first who when thinking about the possibility of spaceships grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs i myself owe to him not only the guiding-star of my life but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel a place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of astronautics career and education according to historian norman davies von braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in germany due to a curious oversight in the treaty of versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to germany involvement with the nazi regime party membership von braun had an ambivalent and complex relationship with the nazi regime of the third reich he officially applied for membership in the nazi party on november 12 1937 and was issued membership number 5738692 michael j neufeld a widely published author of aerospace history and chief of the space history division at the smithsonians national air and space museum wrote that ten years after von braun obtained his nazi party membership he signed an affidavit for the us army misrepresenting the year of his membership saying incorrectly in 1939 i was officially demanded to join the national socialist party at this time i was already technical director at the army rocket center at peenemnde baltic sea the technical work carried out there had in the meantime attracted more and more attention in higher levels thus my refusal to join the party would have meant that i would have to abandon the work of my life therefore i decided to join my membership in the party did not involve any political activity it has never been ascertained whether von brauns error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake although neufeld stated that he might have lied on the affidavit neufeld further wrote von braun like other peenemnders was assigned to the local group in karlshagen there is no evidence that he did more than send in his monthly dues but he is seen in some photographs with the partys swastika pin in his lapel it was politically useful to demonstrate his membership von brauns later attitude toward the national socialist regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex he said that he had been so influenced by the early nazi promise of release from the postworld war i economic effects that his patriotic feelings had increased in a 1952 memoir article he admitted that at that time he fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism yet he also wrote that to us hitler was still only a pompous fool with a charlie chaplin moustache and that he perceived him as another napoleon who was wholly without scruples a godless man who thought himself the only god membership in the allgemeine ss von braun joined the ss horseback riding school on 1 november 1933 as an ss-anwrter he left the following year in 1940 he joined the ss and was given the rank of untersturmfhrer in the allgemeine ss and issued membership number 185068 in 1947 he gave the us war department this explanation in spring 1940 one ss-standartenfuehrer ss-colonel mueller from greifswald a bigger town in the vicinity of peenemnde looked me up in my office and told me that reichsfuehrer ss himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the ss i told him i was so busy with my rocket work that i had no time to spare for any political activity he then told me that the ss would cost me no time at all i would be awarded the rank of an untersturmfuehrer lieutenant and it were sic a very definite desire of himmler that i attend his invitation to join i asked mueller to give me some time for reflection he agreed realizing that the matter was of highly political significance for the relation between the ss and the army i called immediately on my military superior dr dornberger he informed me that the ss had for a long time been trying to get their finger in the pie of the rocket work i asked him what to do he replied on the spot that if i wanted to continue our mutual work i had no alternative but to join when shown a picture of himself standing behind himmler von braun claimed to have worn the ss uniform only that one time but in 2002 a former ss officer at peenemnde told the bbc that von braun had regularly worn the ss uniform to official meetings he began as an untersturmfhrer second lieutenant and was promoted three times by himmler the last time in june 1943 to ss-sturmbannfhrer major von braun later claimed that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail work under nazi regime in 1933 von braun was working on his creative doctorate when the national socialist german workers party nsdap or nazi party came to power in a coalition government in germany rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda an artillery captain walter dornberger arranged an ordnance department research grant for von braun who then worked next to dornbergers existing solid-fuel rocket test site at kummersdorf von braun was awarded a doctorate in physics aerospace engineering on july 27 1934 from the university of berlin for a thesis entitled about combustion tests his doctoral supervisor was erich schumann however this thesis was only the public part of von brauns work his actual full thesis construction theoretical and experimental solution to the problem of the liquid propellant rocket dated april 16 1934 was kept classified by the german army and was not published until 1960 by the end of 1934 his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel rockets that rose to heights of 22 and 35km 2mi at the time germany was highly interested in american physicist robert h goddards research before 1939 german scientists occasionally contacted goddard directly with technical questions wernher von braun used goddards plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the aggregat a series of rockets the a-4 rocket would become well known as the v-2 in 1963 von braun reflected on the history of rocketry and said of goddards work his rockets may have been rather crude by present-day standards but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles goddard confirmed his work was used by von braun in 1944 shortly before the nazis began firing v-2s at england a v-2 crashed in sweden and some parts were sent to an annapolis lab where goddard was doing research for the navy if this was the so-called bckebo bomb it had been procured by the british in exchange for spitfires annapolis would have received some parts from them goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon later von braun would comment i have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the v-2 rockets but there were victims on both sides a war is a war and when my country is at war my duty is to help win that war in response to goddards claims von braun said at no time in germany did i or any of my associates ever see a goddard patent this was independently confirmed he wrote that claims about him lifting goddards work were the furthest from the truth noting that goddards paper a method of reaching extreme altitudes which was studied by von braun and oberth lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets it was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry during the volksverhetzung era as well as receiving us patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 60s there were no german rocket societies after the collapse of the vfr and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new nazi regime only military development was allowed and to this end a larger facility was erected at the village of peenemnde in northern germany on the baltic sea dornberger became the military commander at peenemnde with von braun as technical director in collaboration with the luftwaffe the peenemnde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and jet-assisted takeoffs they also developed the long-range a-4 ballistic missile and the supersonic wasserfall anti-aircraft missile on december 22 1942 adolf hitler ordered the production of the a-4 as a vengeance weapon and the peenemnde group developed it to target london following von brauns july 7 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an a-4 taking off hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von braun a professor shortly thereafter in germany at this time this was an exceptional promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old by that time the british and soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von brauns team at peenemnde based on the intelligence provided by the polish underground home army over the nights of august 1718 1943 raf bomber commands operation hydra dispatched raids on the peenemnde camp consisting of 596 aircraft and dropped 1800 tons of explosives the facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed however the raids killed von brauns engine designer walter thiel and chief engineer walther and the rocket program was delayed the first combat a-4 renamed the v-2 vergeltungswaffe 2 retaliationvengeance weapon 2 for propaganda purposes was launched toward england on september 7 1944 only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned von brauns interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel not for killing people after hearing the news from london he said that the rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet satirist mort sahl has been credited with mocking von braun by saying i aim at the stars but sometimes i hit london that line appears in the film i aim at the stars a 1960 biopic of von braun experiments with rocket aircraft during 1936 von brauns rocketry team working at kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft ernst heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts supplying a he-72 and later two he-112s for the experiments later in 1936 erich warsitz was seconded by the rlm to wernher von braun and ernst heinkel because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge after he familiarized warsitz with a test-stand run showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft he asked are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air then warsitz you will be a famous man and later we will fly to the moon with you at the helm in june 1937 at neuhardenberg a large field about 70km 43mi east of berlin listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by warsitz at which time it was propelled by von brauns rocket power alone despite a wheels-up landing and the fuselage having been on fire it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear at the same time hellmuth walters experiments into hydrogen peroxide based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation also the firm of hellmuth walter at kiel had been commissioned by the rlm to build a rocket engine for the he 112 so there were two different new rocket motor designs at neuhardenberg whereas von brauns engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst von brauns engines used direct combustion and created fire the walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction but both created thrust and provided high speed the subsequent flights with the he-112 used the walter-rocket instead of von brauns it was more reliable simpler to operate and safer for the test pilot warsitz slave labor ss general hans kammler who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including auschwitz had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program arthur rudolph chief engineer of the v-2 rocket factory at peenemnde endorsed this idea in april 1943 when a labor shortage developed more people died building the v-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon von braun admitted visiting the plant at mittelwerk on many occasions and called conditions at the plant repulsive but claimed never to have witnessed any deaths or beatings although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred he denied ever having visited the mittelbau-dora concentration camp itself where 20000 died from illness beatings hangings and intolerable working conditions some prisoners claim von braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it guy morand a french resistance fighter who was a prisoner in dora testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt von braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged while robert cazabonne another french prisoner claimed von braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes however these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity former buchenwald inmate adam cabala claims that von braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers also the german scientists led by prof wernher von braun were aware of everything daily as they went along the corridors they saw the exhaustion of the inmates their arduous work and their pain not one single time did prof wernher von braun protest against this cruelty during his frequent stays at dora even the aspect of corpses did not touch him on a small area near the ambulance shed inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily but prof wernher von braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the corpses von braun later claimed that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners but felt helpless to change the situation arrest and release by the nazi regime according to andr sellier a french historian and survivor of the mittelbau-dora concentration camp heinrich himmler had von braun come to his feldkommandostelle hochwald hq in east prussia in february 1944 to increase his power-base within the nazi regime himmler was conspiring to use kammler to gain control of all german armament programs including the v-2 program at peenemnde he therefore recommended that von braun work more closely with kammler to solve the problems of the v-2 von braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with dornbergers assistance von braun had been under sd surveillance since october 1943 a report stated that he and his colleagues riedel and grttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineers house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well this was considered a defeatist attitude a young female dentist who was an ss spy reported their comments combined with himmlers false charges that von braun was a communist sympathizer and had attempted to sabotage the v-2 program and considering that von braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to england this led to his arrest by the gestapo the unsuspecting von braun was detained on march 14 or march 15 1944 and was taken to a gestapo cell in stettin now szczecin poland where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him through the abwehr in berlin dornberger obtained von brauns conditional release and albert speer reichsminister for munitions and war production persuaded hitler to reinstate von braun so that the v-2 program could continue or turn into a v-4 program which in their view would be impossible without von brauns leadership in his memoirs speer states hitler had finally conceded that von braun was to be protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation surrender to the americans the soviet army was about 160km 100mi from peenemnde in the spring of 1945 when von braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender unwilling to go to the soviets von braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the americans kammler had ordered relocation of his team to central germany however a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight deciding that kammlers order was their best bet to defect to the americans von braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around mittelwerk where they resumed their work for fear of their documents being destroyed by the ss von braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned mine shaft in the harz mountain range while on an official trip in march von braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel his injuries were serious but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be re-broken and re-aligned in april as the allied forces advanced deeper into germany kammler ordered the engineering team to be moved by train into the town of oberammergau in the bavarian alps where they were closely guarded by the ss with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands however von braun managed to convince ss major kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for us bombers von braun and a large number of the engineering team subsequently made it to austria on may 2 1945 upon finding an american private from the us 44th infantry division von brauns brother and fellow rocket engineer magnus approached the soldier on a bicycle calling out in broken english my name is magnus von braun my brother invented the v-2 we want to surrender after the surrender wernher spoke to the press we knew that we had created a new means of warfare and the question as to what nation to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else we wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as germany had just been through and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured the american high command was well aware of how important their catch was von braun had been at the top of the black list the code name for the list of german scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by us military experts on june 9 1945 two days before the scheduled handover of the nordhausen area to the soviets us army major robert b staver chief of the jet propulsion section of the research and intelligence branch of the us army ordnance corps in london and lt col r l williams took von braun and his department chiefs by jeep from garmisch to munich from where they were flown to nordhausen on the next day the group was evacuated 40 miles 64km southwest to witzenhausen a small town in the american zone von braun was briefly detained at the dustbin interrogation center at kransberg castle where the elite of the third reichs economy science and technology were debriefed by us and british intelligence officials initially he was recruited to the us under a program called operation overcast subsequently known as operation paperclip there is evidence however that british intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth eager to gain information that they knew us officials would deny them the team included the young ls snell then the leading british rocket engineer later chief designer of rolls-royce limited and inventor of the concordes engines the specific information the british gleaned remained top secret both from the americans and other allies american career us army career on june 20 1945 the us secretary of state approved the transfer of von braun and his specialists to america however this was not announced to the public until october 1 1945 von braun was among those scientists for whom the joint intelligence objectives agency jioa arguably falsified employment histories and expunged nsdap memberships the first seven technicians arrived in the united states at new castle army air field just south of wilmington delaware on september 20 1945 they were then flown to boston and taken by boat to the army intelligence service post at fort strong in boston harbor later with the exception of von braun the men were transferred to aberdeen proving ground in maryland to sort out the peenemnde documents enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments finally von braun and his remaining peenemnde staff see list of german rocket scientists in the united states were transferred to their new home at fort bliss a large army installation just north of el paso von braun would later write he found it hard to develop a genuine emotional attachment to his new surroundings his chief design engineer walther reidel became the subject of a december 1946 article german scientist says american cooking tasteless dislikes rubberized chicken exposing the presence of von brauns team in the country and drawing criticism from albert einstein and john dingell requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected von braun remarked at peenemnde we had been coddled here you were counting pennies at peenemnde von braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him but was now answering to pimply 26-year-old major jim hamill who possessed an undergraduate degree in engineering his loyal germans still addressed him as herr professor but hamill addressed him as wernher and never responded to von brauns request for more materials every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed while there they trained military industrial and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles as part of the hermes project they helped refurbish assemble and launch a number of v-2s that had been shipped from germany to the white sands proving ground in new mexico they also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications since they were not permitted to leave fort bliss without military escort von braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as pops prisoners of peace in 1950 at the start of the korean war von braun and his team were transferred to huntsville alabama his home for the next 20 years between 1952 and 1956 von braun led the armys rocket development team at redstone arsenal resulting in the redstone rocket which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the united states he personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation work on the redstone led to development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the redstone rocket as director of the development operations division of the army ballistic missile agency von braun with his team then developed the jupiter-c a modified redstone rocket the jupiter-c successfully launched the wests first satellite explorer 1 on january 31 1958 this event signaled the birth of americas space program despite the work on the redstone rocket the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von braun and his colleagues in the soviet union sergei korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the sputnik program while the american government was not very interested in von brauns work or views and embarked only on a very modest rocket-building program in the meantime the press tended to dwell on von brauns past as a member of the ss and the slave labor used to build his v-2 rockets popular concepts for a human presence in space repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in germany von braun while directing military rocket development in the real world continued to entertain his engineer-scientists dream of a future in which rockets would be used for space exploration however he was no longer at risk of being sacked as american public opinion of germans began to recover von braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas the may 14 1950 headline of the huntsville times dr von braun says rocket flights possible to moon might have marked the beginning of these efforts von brauns ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories in 1952 von braun first published his concept of a manned space station in a colliers weekly magazine series of articles titled man will conquer space soon these articles were illustrated by the space artist chesley bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas frequently von braun worked with fellow german-born space advocate and science writer willy ley to publish his concepts which unsurprisingly were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality the space station to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages would be a toroid structure with a diameter of 250 feet 76m this built on the concept of a rotating wheel-shaped station introduced in 1929 by herman potonik in his book the problem of space travel the rocket motor the space station would spin around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity and would be assembled in a 1075-mile 1730km two-hour high-inclination earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on earth on at least a daily basis the ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for manned lunar expeditions more than a decade later the movie version of 2001 a space odyssey would draw heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station von braun envisaged these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings with a total of 50astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft two for crew one primarily for cargo each 49m 16076ft long and 33m 10827ft in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30rocket propulsion engines upon arrival astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the sinus roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks this would include a 400km 249mi expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater harpalus and the mare imbrium foothills at this time von braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a manned mission to mars that used the space station as a staging point his initial plans published in the mars project 1952 had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft each with a mass of 3720 metric tonnes three of them unmanned and each carrying one 200-tonne winged lander in addition to cargo and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70astronauts gigantic as this mission plan was its engineering and astronautical parameters were thoroughly calculated a later project was much more modest using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft in each case the expedition would use minimum-energy hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to mars and back to earth before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to mars von braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject set in the year 1980 however the manuscript was rejected by no fewer than 18publishers von braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines to illustrate selected aspects of his mars project popularizations the complete manuscript titled project mars a technical tale did not appear as a printed book until december 2006 in the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program von braun also began working with walt disney and the disney studios as a technical director initially for three television films about space exploration the initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was man in space which first went on air on march 9 1955 drawing 40 million viewers later in 1959 von braun published a short booklet condensed from episodes that had appeared in this week magazine beforedescribing his updated concept of the first manned lunar landing the scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecrafta winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the moon on an earlier mission the brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages loosely based on the nova designs that were under discussion at this time after a night launch from a pacific island the first three stages would bring the spacecraft with the two remaining upper stages attached to terrestrial escape velocity with each burn creating an acceleration of 89 times standard gravity residual propellant in the third stage would be used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole the fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing much in the way of the space shuttle one remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer wernher von braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick religious conversion in the first half of his life von braun was a nonpracticing perfunctory lutheran whose affiliation was nominal and not taken seriously as described by ernst stuhlinger and frederick i ordway iii throughout his younger years von braun did not show signs of religious devotion or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings in fact he was known to his friends as a merry heathen frhlicher heide nevertheless in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the western allies rather than russians as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people who followed the bible in 1946 he attended church in el paso texas and underwent a religious conversion to evangelical christianity in an unnamed religious magazine he stated one day in fort bliss a neighbor called and asked if i would like to go to church with him i accepted because i wanted to see if the american church was just a country club as id been led to expect instead i found a small white frame building in the hot texas sun on a browned-grass lot together these people make a live vibrant community this was the first time i really understood that religion was not a cathedral inherited from the past or a quick prayer at the last minute to be effective a religion has to be backed up by discipline and effort on the motives behind this conversion michael j neufeld is of the opinion that he turned to religion to pacify his own conscience whereas university of southampton scholar kendrick oliver said that von braun was presumably moved by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the third reich having concluded one bad bargain with the devil perhaps now he felt a need to have god securely at his side later in life he joined an episcopal congregation and became increasingly religious he publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of science and religion the afterlife of the soul and his belief in god he stated through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation through religion he seeks to know the creator he was interviewed by the assemblies of god pastor c m ward as stating the farther we probe into space the greater my faith in addition he met privately with evangelist billy graham and with the pacifist leader martin luther king jr concepts for orbital warfare von braun developed and published his space station concept during the very coldest time of the cold war when the us government for which he worked put the containment of the soviet union above everything else the fact that his space station if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time would give the united states space superiority in both orbital and orbit-to-ground warfare did not escape him in his popular writings von braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles but he took care to qualify such military applications as particularly dreadful this much less peaceful aspect of von brauns drive for space has been reviewed by michael j neufeld from the space history division of the national air and space museum in washington nasa career the us navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit but the resulting vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable in 1957 with the launch of sputnik 1 a growing belief within the united states existed that it was lagging behind the soviet union in the emerging space race american authorities then chose to use von braun and his german teams experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle wernher von braun had such an idea originally proposed in 1954 but it was denied at the time nasa was established by law on july 29 1958 one day later the 50th redstone rocket was successfully launched from johnston atoll in the south pacific as part of operation hardtack i two years later nasa opened the marshall space flight center at redstone arsenal in huntsville and the army ballistic missile agency abma development team led by von braun was transferred to nasa in a face-to-face meeting with herb york at the pentagon von braun made it clear he would go to nasa only if development of the saturn was allowed to continue von braun became the centers first director on 1 july 1960 and held the position until 27 january 1970 von brauns early years at nasa included a failed four-inch flight during which the first unmanned mercury-redstone rocket only rose a few inches before settling back onto the launch pad the launch failure was later determined to be the result of a power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit because of the difference in the length of one prong the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a cut-off signal to the engine the system stopped the launch and the incident created a nadir of morale in project mercury after the flight of mercury-redstone 2 in january 1961 experienced a string of problems von braun insisted on one more test before the redstone could be deemed man-rated his overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program who argued that mr-2s technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight he overruled them so a test mission involving a redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in march von brauns stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the us to launch a manned space mission before the soviet union which ended up putting the first man in space the following month the marshall centers first major program was the development of saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond earth orbit from this the apollo program for manned moon flights was developed wernher von braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an earth orbit rendezvous technique the approach he had argued for building his space station but in 1962 he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized during apollo he worked closely with former peenemnde teammate kurt h debus the first director of the kennedy space center his dream to help mankind set foot on the moon became a reality on july 16 1969 when a marshall-developed saturn v rocket launched the crew of apollo 11 on its historic eight-day mission over the course of the program saturn v rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the moon during the late 1960s von braun was instrumental in the development of the us space and rocket center in huntsville the desk from which he guided americas entry in the space race remains on display there he also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental applications technology satellite he traveled to india and hoped that the program would be helpful for bringing a massive educational television project to help the poorest people in that country during the local summer of 196667 von braun participated in a field trip to antarctica organized for him and several other members of top nasa management the goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by us scientific and technological community during the exploration of antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned exploration of space von braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on antarctic research stations logistics habitation and life support and in using the barren antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on mars and other worlds in an internal memo dated january 16 1969 von braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at huntsville to head the apollo applications program he referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray stating i certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial apollo flights a few months later on occasion of the first moon landing he publicly expressed his optimism that the saturn v carrier system would continue to be developed advocating manned missions to mars in the 1980s nonetheless on march 1 1970 von braun and his family relocated to washington dc when he was assigned the post of nasas deputy associate administrator for planning at nasa headquarters after a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the apollo program and facing severe budget constraints von braun retired from nasa on may 26 1972 not only had it become evident by this time that nasa and his visions for future us space flight projects were incompatible but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the moon had been accomplished von braun also developed the idea of a space camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development career after nasa after leaving nasa von braun became vice president for engineering and development at the aerospace company fairchild industries in germantown maryland on july 1 1972 in 1973 during a routine physical examination von braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time von braun continued his work to the extent possible which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry particularly his desire to encourage the next generation of aerospace engineers von braun helped establish and promote the national space institute a precursor of the present-day national space society in 1975 and became its first president and chairman in 1976 he became scientific consultant to lutz kayser the ceo of otrag and a member of the daimler-benz board of directors however his deteriorating health forced him to retire from fairchild on december 31 1976 when the 1975 national medal of science was awarded to him in early 1977 he was hospitalized and unable to attend the white house ceremony engineering philosophy von brauns insistence on further tests after mercury-redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the soviet unions success in launching the first human in space the mercury-redstone bd flight was successful but took up the launch slot that could have put alan shepard into space three weeks ahead of yuri gagarin his soviet counterpart sergei korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking gagarins life on a manned attempt the second test flight took place one day after the mercury-redstone bd mission von braun took a very conservative approach to engineering designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure this became a point of contention with other engineers who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized as noted above his excessive caution likely led to the us losing the race to put a man into space with the soviets krafft ehricke likened von brauns approach to building the brooklyn bridge many at nasa headquarters jokingly referred to marshall as the chicago bridge and iron works but acknowledged that the designs worked the conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the saturn c-4 producing the saturn v the c-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine personal life von braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies man as a student in berlin he would often be seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once he later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at peenemnde in january 1943 von braun became engaged to dorothee brill a physical education teacher in berlin and sought permission from the ss race and settlement office to marry however the engagement was broken due to his mothers opposition later in 1943 while preparing v-2 launch sites in northeastern france von braun had an affair in paris with a french woman who was imprisoned for collaboration after the war and became destitute during his stay at fort bliss von braun proposed marriage to maria luise von quistorp born 1928-06-10june 10 1928 his maternal first cousin in a letter to his father on march 1 1947 having received permission to go back to germany and return with his bride he married her in a lutheran church in landshut germany shortly after he converted to evangelical christianity he and his bride as well as his father and mother returned to new york on march 26 1947 on december 9 1948 the von brauns first daughter iris careen was born at fort bliss army hospital the von brauns had two more children margrit ccile in 1952 and peter constantine in 1960 on april 15 1955 von braun became a naturalized citizen of the united states death on june 16 1977 wernher von braun died of pancreatic cancer in alexandria virginia at the age of 65 he was buried at the ivy hill cemetery in alexandria virginia von brauns gravestone mentions psalm 191 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork kjv recognition and critique apollo program director sam phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that the united states would have reached the moon as quickly as it did without von brauns help later after discussing it with colleagues he amended this to say that he did not believe the united states would have reached the moon at all the von braun crater on the moon is named after him von braun received a total of 12 honorary doctorates among them on january 8 1963 one from the technical university of berlin from which he had graduated von braun was responsible for the creation of the research institute at the university of alabama in huntsville as a result of his vision the university is one of the leading universities in the nation for nasa-sponsored research the building housing the universitys research institute was named in his honor von braun research hall in 2000 several german cities bonn neu-isenburg mannheim mainz and dozens of smaller towns have streets named after von braun the von braun center built in 1975 in huntsville is named in von brauns honor the von braun astronomical society in huntsville was founded as the rocket city astronomical association by von braun and was later renamed after him scrutiny of von brauns use of forced labor at mittelwerk intensified again in 1984 when arthur rudolph one of his top affiliates from the a-4v2 through the apollo projects left the united states and was forced to renounce his citizenship in place of the alternative of being tried for war crimes a science- and engineering-oriented gymnasium in friedberg bavaria was named after von braun in 1979 in response to rising criticism a school committee decided in 1995 after lengthy deliberations to keep the name but to address von brauns ambiguity in the advanced history classes in 2012 nazi concentration camp survivor david salz gave a speech in friedberg calling out to the public to do everything to make this name disappear from this school in february 2014 the school was finally renamed staatliches gymnasium friedberg and distanced itself from the name von braun citing he was no role-model for our pupils an avenue in the annadale section of staten island new york was named after him in 1977 von braun was voted into the us space and rocket center hall of fame in 2007 summary of ss career ss number 185068 nazi party number 5738692 dates of rank ss-anwrter november 1
