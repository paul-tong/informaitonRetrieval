the islands of the blessed or the fortunate isles located 570 kilometres 350mi west of the cape verde peninsula off the coast of northwest africa the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4000 square kilometres 1500sqmi the cape verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century when portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands establishing the first european settlement in the tropics ideally located for the atlantic slave trade the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries attracting merchants privateers and pirates the end of slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration cape verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes incorporated as an overseas department of portugal in 1951 the islands continued to campaign for independence which was peacefully achieved in 1975 since the early 1990s cape verde has been a stable representative democracy and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in africa lacking natural resources its developing economy is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment its population of around 540000 is mostly of mixed european moorish arab and african heritage and predominantly roman catholic reflecting the legacy of portuguese rule a sizeable diaspora community exists across the world slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands historically the name cape verde has been used in english for the archipelago and since independence in 1975 for the country in 2013 the cape verdean government determined that the portuguese designation cabo verde would henceforth be used for official purposes such as at the united nations even in english contexts cape verde is a member of

appointed governor of cape verde by portuguese king afonso v other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries in the cape verde archipelago are diogo gomes who was with antnio de noli and claimed to have been the first to land on and name santiago island diogo dias diogo afonso and the italian venice-born alvise cadamosto in 1462 portuguese settlers arrived at santiago and founded a settlement they called ribeira grande now called cidade velha old city to avoid being confused with the town of ribeira grande on the santo anto island ribeira grande was the first permanent european settlement in the tropics in the 16th century the archipelago prospered from the atlantic slave trade pirates occasionally attacked the portuguese settlements francis drake an english privateer twice sacked the then capital ribeira grande in 1585 when it was a part of the iberian union after a french attack in 1712 the town declined in importance relative to nearby praia which became the capital in 1770 decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis cape verdes early prosperity slowly vanished however the islands position astride mid-atlantic shipping lanes made cape verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships because of its excellent harbour the city of mindelo located on the island of so vicente became an important commercial centre during the 19th century diplomat edmund roberts visited cape verde in 1832 with few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the portuguese the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters who nevertheless refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy in 1951 portugal changed cape verdes status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing nationalism in 1956 amlcar cabral and a group of fellow cape verdeans and guineans organised in portuguese guinea the clandestine african party for the independence of guinea and cape verde paigc it demanded improvement in economic social and political conditions in cape verde and portuguese guinea and formed the basis of the two nations independence movement moving its headquarters to conakry guinea in 1960 the paigc began an armed rebellion against portugal in 1961 acts of sabotage eventually grew into a war in portuguese guinea that pitted 10000 soviet bloc-supported paigc soldiers against 35000 portuguese and african troops by 1972 the paigc controlled much of portuguese guinea despite the presence of the portuguese troops but the organization did not attempt to disrupt portuguese control in cape verde portuguese guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted de jure independence in 1974 a budding independence movement originally led by amlcar cabral assassinated in 1973 passed on to his half-brother lus cabral and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975 independence 1975 following the april 1974 revolution in portugal the paigc became an active political movement in cape verde in december 1974 the paigc and portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of portuguese and cape verdeans on 30

growth despite its lack of natural resources among other achievements it has been recognised with the following assessments geography the cape verde archipelago is in the atlantic ocean approximately 570 kilometres 350mi off the western coast of the african continent near senegal the gambia and mauritania and is part of the macaronesia ecoregion it lies between latitudes 14 and 18n and longitudes 22 and 26w the country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands nine inhabited and eight islets that constitute an area of 4033km the islands are spatially divided into two groups the barlavento islands windward islands santo anto so vicente santa luzia so nicolau sal boa vista and the sotavento islands leeward maio santiago fogo brava the largest island both in size and population is santiago which hosts the nations capital praia the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago three of the cape verde islands sal boa vista and maio are fairly flat sandy and dry the others are generally rockier with more vegetation physical geography and geology geologically the islands covering a combined area of slightly over 4033 square kilometres 1557 square miles are principally composed of igneous rocks with volcanic structures and pyroclastic debris comprising the majority of the archipelagos total volume the volcanic and plutonic rocks are distinctly basic the archipelago is a soda-alkaline petrographic province with a petrologic succession similar to that found in other macaronesian islands magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125150 million years the islands themselves date from 8 million in the west to 20 million years in the east the oldest exposed rocks occurred on maio and northern peninsula of santiago and are 128131 million year old pillow lavas the first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early miocene and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes historical volcanism within human settlement has been restricted to the island of fogo the origin of the islands volcanism has been attributed to a hotspot associated with bathymetric swell that formed the cape verde rise the rise is one of the largest protuberances in the worlds oceans rising 22 kilometres 14 miles in a semi-circular region of 1200km associated with a rise of the geoid and elevated surface heat flow most recently erupting in 2014 pico do fogo is the largest active volcano in the region it has a 8 kilometres 5 miles diameter caldera whose rim is 1600 metres 5249 feet altitude and an interior cone that rises to 2829 metres 9281 feet above sea level the caldera resulted from subsidence following the partial evacuation eruption of the magma chamber along a cylindrical column from within magma chamber at a depth of 8 kilometres 5 miles extensive salt flats are found on sal and maio on santiago santo anto and so nicolau arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains ocean cliffs have been formed by catastrophic debris landslides according to the president of nauru cape verde has been ranked the eighth most endangered nation due to flooding from climate change geography of cape verde the countryside in estrada baa das gatas the

ribeira da gara valley in santo anto ribeira da gara valley in santo anto climate cape verdes climate is milder than that of the african mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands and cold atlantic currents produce an arid atmosphere around the archipelago conversely the islands do not receive the upwellings cold streams that affect the west african coast so the air temperature is cooler than in senegal but the sea is warmer because the orographic relief of some islands such as santiago with steep mountains cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants rocks soil logs moss etc on the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands exclusively in mountainous areas like santo anto island the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest and laurel forest as this vegetation average daily high temperatures range from 26c 79f in february to 31c 878f in september cape verde is part of the sahelian arid belt with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby west africa it rains irregularly between august and october with frequent brief heavy downpours a desert is usually defined as terrain that receives less than 250mm 98in of annual rainfall sals total of 145mm 57in confirms this classification most of the years rain falls in september sal boa vista and maio have a flat landscape and arid climate the remaining ones are generally rockier and have more vegetation because of the infrequent occurrence of rainfall the landscape is arid the archipelago can be divided into four broad ecological zones arid semiarid subhumid and humid according to altitude and average annual rainfall ranging from 200 millimetres 79 inches in the arid areas of the coast to more than 1000 millimetres 39 inches in the humid mountain most rainfall precipitation is due to condensation of the ocean mist in some islands as santiago the wetter climate of the interior and the eastern coast contrasts with the dryer one in the southsouthwest coast praia on the southeast coast is the largest city of the island and the largest city and capital of the country because of their proximity to the sahara most of the cape verde islands are dry but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the coast by orography the humidity is much higher providing a rainforest habitat although much affected by the human presence northeastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain while southwest slopes do not these umbria areas are identified with cool and moisture western hemisphere-bound hurricanes often have their early beginnings near the cape verde islands these are referred to as cape verde-type hurricanes these hurricanes can become very intense as they cross warm atlantic waters away from cape verde the average hurricane season has about two cape verde-type hurricanes which are usually the largest and most intense storms of the season because they often have plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before encountering land the five largest atlantic tropical cyclones on record have been cape verde-type hurricanes most of the longest-lived tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin are cape verde hurricanes the islands themselves have only been struck by hurricanes twice in recorded history since 1851 once in 1892 and again in 2015 by hurricane fred the easternmost hurricane ever to form in the atlantic biome cape verdes isolation has resulted in the islands having a number of endemic species particularly birds and reptiles many of which are endangered by human development endemic birds include alexanders swift apus alexandri bournes heron ardea purpurea bournei the raso lark alauda razae the cape verde warbler acrocephalus brevipennis and the iago sparrow passer iagoensis the islands are also an important breeding area for seabirds including the cape verde shearwater reptiles include the cape verde giant gecko tarentola

over 7 percent a year well above the average for sub-saharan countries and faster than most small island economies in the region strong economic performance was bolstered by one of the fastest growing tourism industries in the world as well as by substantial capital inflows that allowed cape verde to build up national currency reserves to the current 35 months of imports unemployment has been falling rapidly and the country is on track to achieve most of the un millennium development goals including halving its 1990 poverty level in 2007 cape verde joined the world trade organization wto
