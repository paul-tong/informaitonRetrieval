the hill sphere of an astronomical body is the region in which it dominates the attraction of satellites the outer shell of that region constitutes a zero-velocity surface to be retained by a planet a moon must have an orbit that lies within the planets hill sphere that moon would in turn have a hill sphere of its own any object within that distance would tend to become a satellite of the moon rather than of the planet itself one simple view of the extent of the solar system is the hill sphere of the sun with respect to local stars and the galactic nucleus in more precise terms the hill sphere approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of a smaller body in the face of perturbations from a more massive body it was defined by the american astronomer george william hill based on the work of the french astronomer douard roche for this reason it is also known as the roche sphere not to be confused with the roche limit or roche lobe in the example to the right earths hill sphere extends between the lagrangian points l1 and l2 which lie along the line of centers of the two bodies the region of influence of the second body is shortest in that direction and so it acts as the limiting factor for the size of the hill sphere beyond that distance a third object in orbit around the second eg the moon would spend at least part of its orbit outside the hill sphere and would be progressively perturbed by the tidal forces of the central body eg the sun eventually ending up orbiting the latter formula and examples if the mass of the smaller body eg earth is m displaystyle m and it orbits a heavier body eg sun of mass m displaystyle m with a semi-major axis a displaystyle a and an eccentricity of e displaystyle e then the radius r h displaystyle rmathrm h of the hill sphere of the smaller body eg earth calculated at pericenter is approximately when eccentricity is negligible the most favourable case for orbital stability this becomes in the earth example the earth 59710 kg orbits the sun 19910 kg at a distance of 1496 million km or one astronomical unit au the hill sphere for earth thus extends out to about 15 million km 001 au the moons orbit at a distance of 0384 million km from earth is comfortably within the gravitational sphere of influence of earth and it is therefore not at risk of being pulled into an independent orbit around the sun all stable satellites of the earth those within the earths hill sphere must have an orbital period shorter than seven months the previous eccentricity-ignoring formula can be re-stated as follows this expresses the relation in terms of the volume of the hill sphere compared with the volume of the second bodys orbit around the first specifically the ratio of the masses is three times the ratio of the volume of these two spheres the expression for the hill radius can be found by equating gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on a test particle of mass much smaller than m displaystyle m orbiting the secondary body assume that the distance between masses m displaystyle m and m displaystyle m is r displaystyle r and that the test particle is orbiting at a distance r h displaystyle rmathrm h from the secondary when the test particle is on the line connecting the primary and the secondary body the force balance requires that where g displaystyle g is the gravitational constant and g m r 3 displaystyle omega sqrt frac gmr3 is the keplerian angular velocity of the secondary about the primary assuming that m m displaystyle mll m the above equation can also be written as which through a binomial expansion to leading order in r h r displaystyle rmathrm h r becomes hence the relation stated above notice that if the orbit of the secondary about the primary is elliptical the hill radius is maximum at the apocenter where r displaystyle r is largest and minimum at the pericenter of the orbit therefore for purposes of stability of test particles for example of small satellites the hill radius at the pericenter distance needs to be considered to leading order in r h r displaystyle rmathrm h r the hill radius above also represents the distance of the lagrangian point l1 from the secondary a quick way of estimating the radius of the hill sphere comes from replacing mass with density in the above equation where s e c o n d displaystyle rho mathrm second and p r i m a r y displaystyle rho mathrm primary are the average densities of the primary and secondary bodies and r s e c o n d a r y displaystyle rmathrm secondary and r p r i m a r y displaystyle rmathrm primary are their radii the second approximation is justified by the fact that for most cases in the solar system s e c o n d a r y 3 p r i m a r y 3 displaystyle sqrt3frac rho mathrm secondary 3rho mathrm primary happens to be close to one the earthmoon system is the largest exception and this approximation is within 20 for most of saturns satellites this is also convenient because many planetary astronomers work in and remember distances in units of planetary radii true region of stability the hill sphere is only an approximation and other forces such as radiation pressure or the yarkovsky effect can eventually perturb an object out of the sphere this third object should also be of small enough mass that it introduces no additional complications through its own gravity detailed numerical calculations show that orbits at or just within the hill sphere are not stable in the long term it appears that stable satellite orbits exist only inside 12 to 13 of the hill radius the region of stability for retrograde orbits at a large distance from the primary is larger than the region for prograde orbits at a large distance from the primary this was thought to explain the preponderance of retrograde moons around jupiter however saturn has a more even mix of retrogradeprograde moons so the reasons are more complicated further examples an astronaut could not have orbited the space shuttle with mass of 104 tonnes where the orbit was 300km above the earth because its hill sphere at that altitude was only 120cm in radius much smaller than the shuttle itself a sphere of this size and mass would be denser than lead in fact in any low earth orbit a spherical body must be more dense than lead in order to fit inside its own hill sphere or else it will be incapable of supporting an orbit a spherical geostationary satellite however would only need to be more than 6 of the density of water to support satellites of its own within the solar system the planet with the largest hill radius is neptune with 116 million km or 0775 au its great distance from the sun amply compensates for its small mass relative to jupiter whose own hill radius measures 53 million km an asteroid from the asteroid belt will have a hill sphere that can reach 220000km for 1 ceres diminishing rapidly with decreasing mass the hill sphere of 66391 1999 kw4 a mercury-crossing asteroid that has a moon s2001 66391 1 measures 22km in radius a typical extrasolar hot jupiter hd 209458 b has a hill sphere radius of 593000km about eight times its physical radius of approx 71000km even the smallest close-in extrasolar planet corot-7b still has a hill sphere radius 61000km six times its physical radius approx 10000km therefore these planets could have small moons close in although not within their respective roche limits solar system the following logarithmic plot shows the hill radius in km of some bodies of the solar system see also interplanetary transport network n-body problem
