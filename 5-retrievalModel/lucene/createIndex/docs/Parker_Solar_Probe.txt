parker solar probe previously solar probe solar probe plus or solar probe abbreviated psp is a nasa robotic spacecraft launched in 2018 and currently en route to probe the outer corona of the sun it will approach to within 986 solar radii 69 million kilometers or 43 million miles from the center of the sun and by 2025 will travel at closest approach as fast as 690000kmh 430000mph or 0064 the speed of light the project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year the cost of the project is us15 billion johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory designed and built the spacecraft which was launched on august 12 2018 it became the first nasa spacecraft named after a living person honoring physicist eugene parker professor emeritus at the university of chicago a memory card containing the names of over 11 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecrafts high-gain antenna on may 18 2018 the card also contains photos of parker and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper predicting important aspects of solar physics on 29 october 2018 at about 104pm edt the spacecraft became the closest ever man-made object to the sun the previous record 2655 million miles from the suns surface was set by the helios 2 spacecraft in april 1976 history the parker solar probe concept originates from a predecessor solar orbiter project conceived in the 1990s similar in design and objectives the solar probe mission served as one of the centerpieces of the eponymous outer planetsolar probe opsp program formulated by nasa the first three missions of the program were planned to be the solar orbiter the pluto and kuiper belt reconnaissance mission pluto kuiper express and the europa orbiter astrobiology mission focused on europa the original solar probe design used a gravity assist from jupiter to enter a polar orbit which dropped almost directly toward the sun while this explored the important solar poles and came even closer to the surface 3r a perihelion of 4r the extreme variation in solar irradiance made for an expensive mission and required a radioisotope thermal generator for power the trip to jupiter also made for a long mission 32 years to first solar perihelion 8 years to second following the appointment of sean okeefe as administrator of nasa the entirety of the opsp program was canceled as part of president george w bushs request for the 2003 united states federal budget administrator okeefe cited a need for a restructuring of nasa and its projects falling in line with the bush administrations wish for nasa to refocus on research and development and addressing management shortcomings the cancellation of the program also resulted in the initial cancellation of new horizons the mission that eventually won the competition to replace pluto kuiper express in the former opsp program that mission which would eventually be launched as the first mission of the new frontiers program a conceptual successor to the opsp program would undergo a lengthy political battle to secure funding for its launch which occurred in 2006 in the early 2010s plans for the solar probe mission were incorporated into a lower-cost solar probe plus the redesigned mission uses multiple venus gravity assists for a more direct flight path which can be powered by solar panels it also has a higher perihelion reducing the demands on the thermal protection system in may 2017 the spacecraft was renamed parker solar probe in honor of astrophysicist eugene parker coiner of the term solar wind the solar probe cost nasa us15 billion the launch rocket bore a dedication in memory of apl engineer andrew a dantzler who had worked on the project spacecraft the parker solar probe will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona it will assess the structure and dynamics of the suns coronal plasma and magnetic field the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles the spacecrafts systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the sun by a solar shield incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately 7005650000000000000650kwm or 475 times the intensity at earth orbit the solar shield is hexagonal mounted on the sun-facing side of the spacecraft 23m 75ft in diameter 114cm 45in thick and is made of reinforced carboncarbon composite which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 1370c 2500f a white reflective alumina surface layer minimizes absorption the spacecraft systems and scientific instruments are located in the central portion of the shields shadow where direct radiation from the sun is fully blocked if the shield were not between the spacecraft and the sun the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds as radio communication with earth will take about eight minutes the parker solar probe will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself this will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct sun light coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from fly wheels to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again according to project scientist nicky fox the team describe it as the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown the primary power for the mission is a dual system of solar panels photovoltaic arrays a primary photovoltaic array used for the portion of the mission outside 7010373994676750000025au is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the sun and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach this secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain operating temperature of the solar panels and instrumentation trajectory the parker solar probe mission design uses repeated gravity assists at venus to incrementally decrease its orbital perihelion to achieve a final altitude above the surface of approximately 85 solar radii or about 610 km 3710 mi 0040au the spacecraft trajectory will include seven venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the sun for a total of 24 orbits the near sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects radiation damage in materials and electronics and communication interruptions so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the sun the trajectory requires high launch energy so the probe was launched on a delta iv heavy class launch vehicle and an upper stage based on the star 48bv solid rocket motor interplanetary gravity assists will provide further deceleration relative to its heliocentric orbit which will result in a heliocentric speed record at perihelion as the probe passes around the sun it will achieve a velocity of up to 200kms 120mis which will temporarily make it the fastest manmade object almost three times as fast as the current record holder helios-b like every object in an orbit due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion then slow down again afterward until it reaches its aphelion mission within each orbit of the parker solar probe around the sun the portion within 025au will be the science phase in which the probe will be actively and autonomously making observations communication with the probe will be largely cut off in that phase these science phases will run for a few days both before and after each perihelion they will last 116 days for the earliest perihelion and drop to 96 days for the final closest perihelion much of the rest of each orbit will be devoted to transmitting data from the science observation and measurement phase but during this part of each orbit there will still be periods when communication is impeded or not possible first the heat shield of the probe must be pointed towards the sun there will be times when that will put the heat shield between the antenna and earth secondly even when the probe is not particularly near the sun when the angle between the probe and the sun as seen from earth is too small the suns radiation will overwhelm the communication link science goals the goals of the mission are trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind determine the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of solar wind determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles investigations to achieve these goals the mission will perform five major experiments or investigations electromagnetic fields investigation fields this investigation will make direct measurements of electric and magnetic fields radio waves poynting flux absolute

the probe will be in an elliptical orbit with a period of 150 days two-thirds the period of venus making three orbits while venus makes two on the second flyby the period shortens to 130 days after less than two orbits only 198 days later it encounters venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of venus this encounter shortens its period to half of that of venus or about 1125 days after two orbits it meets venus a fourth time at about the same place shortening its period to about 102 days after 237 days it meets venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days three-sevenths that of venus it then makes seven orbits while venus makes three the sixth encounter almost two years after the fifth brings its period down to 92 days two-fifths that of venus after five more orbits two orbits of venus it meets venus for the seventh and last time decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the sun the perihelion distances above are from the center of the sun for altitude above the surface subtract one solar radius 07gm by way of comparison the planet mercury orbits the sun at a distance varying from about 460gm 46001200km
