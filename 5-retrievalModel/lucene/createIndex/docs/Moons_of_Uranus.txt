uranus the seventh planet of the solar system has 27 known moons all of which are named after characters from the works of william shakespeare and alexander pope uranuss moons are divided into three groups thirteen inner moons five major moons and nine irregular moons the inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with uranuss rings the five major moons are massive enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces the largest of these five titania is 1578km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the solar system and about one-twentieth the mass the earths moon the orbits of the regular moons are nearly coplanar with uranuss equator which is tilted 9777 to its orbit uranuss irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined mostly retrograde orbits at large distances from the planet william herschel discovered the first two moons titania and oberon in 1787 and the other three ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by william lassell ariel and umbriel and in 1948 by gerard kuiper miranda these five have planetary mass and so would be considered dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit about the sun the remaining moons were discovered after 1985 either during the voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced earth-based telescopes discovery the first two moons to be discovered were titania and oberon which were spotted by sir william herschel on january 11 1787 six years after he had discovered the planet itself later herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons see below and perhaps even a ring for nearly 50years herschels instrument was the only one with which the moons had been seen in the 1840s better instruments and a more favorable position of uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to titania and oberon eventually the next two moons ariel and umbriel were discovered by william lassell in 1851 the roman numbering scheme of uranuss moons was in a state of flux for a considerable time and publications hesitated between herschels designations where titania and oberon are uranus ii and iv and william lassells where they are sometimes i and ii with the confirmation of ariel and umbriel lassell numbered the moons i through iv from uranus outward and this finally stuck in 1852 herschels son john herschel gave the four then-known moons their names no other discoveries were made for almost another century in 1948 gerard kuiper at the mcdonald observatory discovered the smallest and the last of the five large spherical moons miranda decades later the flyby of the voyager 2 space probe in january 1986 led to the discovery of ten further inner moons another satellite perdita was discovered in 1999 after studying old voyager photographs uranus was the last giant planet without any known irregular moons but since 1997 nine distant irregular moons have been identified using ground-based telescopes two more small inner moons cupid and mab were discovered using the hubble space telescope in 2003 as of 2016 the moon margaret was the last uranian moon discovered and its characteristics were published in october 2003 spurious moons after herschel discovered titania and oberon on january 11 1787 he subsequently believed that he had observed four other moons two on january 18 and february 9 1790 and two more on february 28 and march 26 1794 it was thus believed for many decades thereafter that uranus had a system of six satellites though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer lassells observations of 1851 in which he discovered ariel and umbriel however failed to support herschels observations ariel and umbriel which herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside titania and oberon did not correspond to any of herschels four additional satellites in orbital characteristics herschels four spurious satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 589 days interior to titania 1096 days between titania and oberon 3808 days and 10769 days exterior to oberon it was therefore concluded that herschels four satellites were spurious probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars in the vicinity of uranus as satellites and the credit for the discovery of ariel and umbriel was given to lassell names although the first two uranian moons were discovered in 1787 they were not named until 1852 a year after two more moons had been discovered the responsibility for naming was taken by john herschel son of the discoverer of uranus herschel instead of assigning names from greek mythology named the moons after magical spirits in english literature the fairies oberon and titania from william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream and the sylphs ariel and umbriel from alexander popes the rape of the lock ariel is also a sprite in shakespeares the tempest the reasoning was presumably that uranus as god of the sky and air would be attended by spirits of the air subsequent names rather than continuing the airy spirits theme only puck and mab continued the trend have focused on herschels source material in 1949 the fifth moon miranda was named by its discoverer gerard kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in shakespeares the tempest the current iau practice is to name moons after characters from shakespeares plays and the rape of the lock although at present only ariel umbriel and belinda have names drawn from the latter all the rest are from shakespeare at first the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play the tempest but with margaret being named from much ado about nothing that trend has ended the rape of the lock a poem by alexander pope ariel umbriel belinda ariel umbriel belinda plays by william shakespeare a midsummer nights dream titania oberon puck the tempest ariel

planets indeed the combined mass of the five major satellites is less than half that of triton the seventh-largest moon in the solar system alone the largest of the satellites titania has a radius of 7889km or less than half that of the moon but slightly more than that of rhea the second-largest moon of saturn making titania the eighth-largest moon in the solar system uranus is about 10000times more massive than its moons inner moons as of 2016 uranus is known to have 13 inner moons their orbits lie inside that of miranda all inner moons are intimately connected with the rings of uranus which probably resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small inner moons the two innermost moons cordelia and ophelia are shepherds of uranuss ring whereas the small moon mab is a source of uranuss outermost ring there may be two additional small 27km in radius undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to uranus and rings at 162km puck is the largest of the inner moons of uranus and the only one imaged by voyager 2 in any detail puck and mab are the two outermost inner satellites of uranus all inner moons are dark objects their geometrical albedo is less than 10 they are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material probably radiation-processed organics the small inner moons constantly perturb each other the system is chaotic and apparently unstable simulations show that the moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits which may eventually result in collisions between the moons desdemona may collide with either cressida or juliet within the next 100million years large moons uranus has five major moons miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon they range in diameter from 472km for miranda to 1578km for titania all these moons are relatively dark objects their geometrical albedo varies between 30 and 50 whereas their bond albedo is between 10 and 23 umbriel is the darkest moon and ariel the brightest the masses of the moons range from 6710kg miranda to 3510kg titania for comparison the moon has a mass of 7510kg the major moons of uranus are thought to have formed in the accretion disc which existed around uranus for some time after its formation or resulted from a large impact suffered by uranus early in its history all major moons comprise approximately equal amounts rock and ice except miranda which is made primarily of ice the ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide their surfaces are heavily cratered though all of them except umbriel show signs of endogenic resurfacing in the form of lineaments canyons and in the case of miranda ovoid race-track like structures called coronae extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters while umbriels appears oldest a past 31 orbital resonance between miranda and umbriel and a past 41 resonance between ariel and titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on miranda and ariel one piece of evidence for such a past resonance is mirandas unusually high orbital inclination 434 for a body so close to the planet the largest uranian moons may be internally differentiated with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles titania and oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the coremantle boundary the major moons of uranus are airless bodies for instance titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 1020nanobar the path of the sun in the local sky over the course of a local day during uranuss and its major moons summer solstice is quite different from that seen on most other solar system worlds the major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as uranus their axes are parallel to that of uranus the sun would appear to follow a circular path around uranuss celestial pole in the sky at the closest about 7 degrees from it near the equator it would be seen nearly due north or due south depending on the season at latitudes higher than 7 the sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky and never set irregular moons as of 2005 uranus is known to have nine irregular moons which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of oberon the furthest of the large moons all the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by uranus soon after its formation the diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far the moons above the x axis are prograde those beneath are retrograde the radius of the uranian hill sphere is approximately 73million km uranuss irregular moons range in size from 120200km sycorax to about 20km trinculo unlike jupiters irregulars uranuss show no correlation of axis with inclination instead the retrograde moons can be divided into two groups based on axisorbital eccentricity the inner group includes those satellites closer to uranus a 015 rh and moderately eccentric 02 namely francisco caliban stephano and trinculo the outer group a 015 rh includes satellites with high eccentricity 05 sycorax prospero setebos and ferdinand the intermediate inclinations 60 i 140 are devoid of known moons due to the kozai instability in this instability region solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites or ejection the lifetime of moons in the instability region is from 10million to a billion years margaret is the only known irregular prograde moon of uranus and it currently has the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the solar system though neptunes moon nereid has a higher mean eccentricity as of 2008 margarets eccentricity is 07979 list the uranian moons are listed here by orbital period from shortest to longest moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in light blue and bolded irregular moons with retrograde orbits are shown in dark grey margaret the only known irregular moon of uranus with a prograde orbit is shown in light grey sources
