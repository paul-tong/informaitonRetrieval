the human eye is an organ which reacts to light and pressure as a sense organ the mammalian eye allows vision human eyes help to provide a three dimensional moving image normally coloured in daylight rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth the human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon similar to the eyes of other mammals the human eyes non-image-forming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock structure the eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere rather it is a fused two-piece unit composed of the anterior segment and the posterior segment the anterior segment is made up of the cornea iris and lens the cornea is transparent and more curved and is linked to the larger posterior segment composed of the vitreous retina choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera the cornea is typically about 115mm 03in in diameter and 12mm 500m in thickness near its center the posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths its diameter is typically about 24mm the cornea and sclera are connected by an area termed the limbus the iris is the pigmented circular structure concentrically surrounding the center of the eye the pupil which appears to be black the size of the pupil which controls the amount of light entering the eye is adjusted by the iris dilator and sphincter muscles light energy enters the eye through the cornea through the pupil and then through the lens the lens shape is changed for near focus accommodation and is controlled by the ciliary muscle photons of light falling on the light-sensitive cells of the retina photoreceptor cones and rods are converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve and interpreted as sight and vision size dimensions typically differ among adults by only one or two millimetres remarkably consistent across different ethnicities the vertical measure generally less than the horizontal is about 24mm the transverse size of a human adult eye is approximately 242mm and the sagittal size is 237mm with no significant difference between sexes and age groups strong correlation has been found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit r 088 the typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of 24 millimetres a volume of six cubic centimetres 04 cu in and a mass of 75 grams weight of 025 oz the eyeball grows rapidly increasing from about 1617 millimetres about 065inch at birth to 22523mm approx 089 in by three years of age by age 12 the eye attains its full size components the eye is made up of three coats or layers enclosing various anatomical structures the outermost layer known as the fibrous tunic is composed of the cornea and sclera the middle layer known as the vascular tunic or uvea consists of the choroid ciliary body pigmented epithelium and iris the innermost is the retina which gets its oxygenation from the blood vessels of the choroid posteriorly as well as the retinal vessels anteriorly the spaces of the eye are filled with the aqueous humour anteriorly between the cornea and lens and the vitreous body a jelly-like substance behind the lens filling the entire posterior cavity the aqueous humour is a clear watery fluid that is contained in two areas the anterior chamber between the cornea and the iris and the posterior chamber between the iris and the lens the lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament zonule of zinn made up of hundreds of fine transparent fibers which transmit muscular forces to change the shape of the lens for accommodation focusing the vitreous body is a clear substance composed of water and proteins which give it a jelly-like and sticky composition vision field of view the approximate field of view of an individual human eye measured from the fixation point ie the point at which ones gaze is directed varies by facial anatomy but is typically 30 superior up limited by the brow 45 nasal limited by the nose 70 inferior down and 100 temporal towards the temple for both eyes combined binocular visual field is 135 vertical and 200 horizontal when viewed at large angles from the side the iris and pupil may still be visible by the viewer indicating the person has peripheral vision possible at that angle about 15 temporal and 15 below the horizontal is the blind spot created by the optic nerve nasally which is roughly 75 high and 55 wide dynamic range the retina has a static contrast ratio of around 1001 about 65 f-stops as soon as the eye moves rapidly to acquire a target saccades it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris which adjusts the size of the pupil initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound uninterrupted darkness full adaptation through adjustments in retinal rod photoreceptors is 80 complete in thirty minutes the process is nonlinear and multifaceted so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow thus dark adaptation may be hampered by retinal disease poor vascular circulation and high altitude exposure the human eye can detect a luminance range of 10 or one hundred trillion 100000000000000 about 465 f-stops from 10 cdm or one millionth 0000001 of a candela per square meter to 10 cdm or one hundred million 100000000 candelas per square meter this range does not include looking at the midday sun 10 cdm or lightning discharge at the low end of the range is the absolute threshold of vision for a steady light across a wide field of view about 10 cdm2 0000001 candela per square meter the upper end of the range is given in terms of normal visual performance as 10 cdm 100000000 or one hundred million candelas per square meter the eye includes a lens similar to lenses found in optical instruments such as cameras and the same physics principles can be applied the pupil of the human eye is its aperture the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture the entrance pupil to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter the entrance pupil is typically about 4mm in diameter although it can range from 2mm f83 in a brightly lit place to 8mm f21 in the dark the latter value decreases slowly with age older peoples eyes sometimes dilate to not more than 5-6mm in the dark and may be as small as 1mm in the light eye movement the visual system in the human brain is too slow to process information if images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second thus to be able to see while moving the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes frontal-eyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity the fovea centralis it covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people to get a clear view of the world the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual degradation having two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object called stereovision and gives the sense of three-dimensionality to the vision both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to stimulate stereovision otherwise double vision might occur some persons with congenitally crossed eyes tend to ignore one eyes vision thus do not suffer double vision and do not have stereovision the movements of the eye are controlled by six muscles attached to each eye and allow the eye to elevate depress converge diverge and roll these muscles are both controlled voluntarily and involuntarily to track objects and correct for simultaneous head movements extraocular muscles each eye has six muscles that control its movements the lateral rectus the medial rectus the inferior rectus the superior rectus the inferior oblique and the superior oblique when the muscles exert different tensions a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn in almost pure rotation with only about one millimeter of translation thus the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the center of the eye rapid eye movement rapid eye movement rem typically refers to the sleep stage during which the most vivid dreams occur during this stage the eyes move rapidly saccades saccades are quick simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain fixational eye movements even when looking intently at a single spot the eyes drift around this ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees without changing input these cells would otherwise stop generating output fixational eye movements include drift ocular tremor and microsaccades some irregular drifts movements smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade subtend up to one tenth of a degree microsaccades move the eye no more than a total of 2 in adult humans vestibulo-ocular reflexes the vestibulo-ocular reflex is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement in response to neural input from the vestibular system of the inner ear thus maintaining the image in the center of the visual field for example when the head moves to the right the eyes move to the left this applies for head movements up and down left and right and tilt to the right and left all of which give input to the ocular muscles to maintain visual stability smooth pursuit movement eyes can also follow a moving object around this tracking is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply feedback following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up the smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100s in adult humans it is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving unless there is another point of reference for determining speed optokinetic reflex the optokinetic reflex or optokinetic nystagmus stabilizes the image on the retina through visual feedback it is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina when the gaze direction deviates too far from the forward heading a compensatory saccade is induced to reset the gaze to the centre of the visual field for example when looking out of the window at a moving train the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment by stabilizing it on the retina until the train moves out of the field of vision at this point the eye is moved back to the point where it first saw the train through a saccade near response the adjustment to close-range vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina vergence movement when a creature with binocular vision looks at an object the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes to look at a nearby object the eyes rotate towards each other convergence while for an object farther away they rotate away from each other divergence pupil constriction lenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as they can closer to the center the image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges spherical aberration it can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the better-focused center in the eye the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects small apertures also give an increase in depth of field allowing a broader range of in focus vision in this way the pupil has a dual purpose for near vision to reduce spherical aberration and increase depth of field accommodation of the lens changing the curvature of the lens is carried out by the ciliary muscles surrounding the lens this process is called accommodation accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens and allows the lens to relax into a more convex or globular shape a more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus clinical significance eye care professionals the human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a general practitioner these specialists or eye care professionals serve different functions in different countries eye care professionals can have overlap in their patient care privileges for example both an ophthalmologist md and optometrist od are professionals who diagnoses eye disease and can prescribe lenses to correct vision however typically only ophthalmologists are licensed to perform surgical procedures ophthalmologists may also specialize within a surgical area such as cornea cataracts laser retina or oculoplastics other eye care professionals include optometrists opticians vision therapists and orthoptists ocularists eye irritation eye irritation has been defined as the magnitude of any stinging scratching burning or other irritating sensation from the eye it is a common problem experienced by people of all ages related eye symptoms and signs of irritation are discomfort dryness excess tearing itching grating foreign body sensation ocular fatigue pain scratchiness soreness redness swollen eyelids and tiredness etc these eye symptoms are reported with intensities from mild to severe it has been suggested that these eye symptoms are related to different causal mechanisms and symptoms are related to the particular ocular anatomy involved several suspected causal factors in our environment have been studied so far one hypothesis is that indoor air pollution may cause eye and airway irritation eye irritation depends somewhat on destabilization of the outer-eye tear film in which the formation of dry spots on the cornea resulting in ocular discomfort occupational factors are also likely to influence the perception of eye irritation some of these are lighting glare and poor contrast gaze position reduced blink rate limited number of breaks from visual tasking and a constant combination of accommodation musculoskeletal burden and impairment of the visual nervous system another factor that may be related is work stress in addition psychological factors have been found in multivariate analyses to be associated with an increase in eye irritation among vdu users other risk factors such as chemical toxinsirritants eg amines formaldehyde acetaldehyde acrolein n-decane vocs ozone pesticides and preservatives allergens etc might cause eye irritation as well certain volatile organic compounds that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause eye irritation personal factors eg use of contact lenses eye make-up and certain medications may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms nevertheless if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation their content of surface-active compounds must be high an integrated physiological risk model with blink frequency destabilization and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational climate and eye-related physiological risk factors there are two major measures of eye irritation one is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior the other measures are break up time tear flow hyperemia redness swelling tear fluid cytology and epithelial damage vital stains etc which are human beings physiological reactions blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of 2-3 to 20-30 blinksminute and they depend on environmental factors including the use of contact lenses dehydration mental activities work conditions room temperature relative humidity and illumination all influence blink frequency break-up time but is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability it is defined as the time interval in seconds between blinking and rupture but is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well in normal persons the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks and therefore the tear film is maintained studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time this phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch other evaluating methods such as hyperemia cytology etc have increasingly been used to assess eye irritation there are other factors that are related to eye irritation as well three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution contact lenses and gender differences field studies have found that the prevalence of objective eye signs is often significantly altered among office workers in comparisons with random samples of the general population these research results might indicate that indoor air pollution has played an important role in causing eye irritation there are more and more people wearing contact lens now and dry eyes appear to be the most common complaint among contact lens wearers although both contact lens wearers and spectacle wearers experience similar eye irritation symptoms dryness redness and grittiness have been reported far more frequently among contact lens wearers and with greater severity than among spectacle wearers studies have shown that incidence of dry eyes increases with age especially among women tear film stability eg break-up time is significantly lower among women than among men in addition women have a higher blink frequency while reading several factors may contribute to gender differences one is the use of eye make-up another reason could be that the women in the reported studies have done more vdu work than the men including lower grade work a third often-quoted explanation is related to the age-dependent decrease of tear secretion particularly among women after 40 years of age in a study conducted by ucla the frequency of reported symptoms in industrial buildings was investigated the studys results were that eye irritation was the most frequent symptom in industrial building spaces at 81 modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects since the 1970s reports have linked mucosal skin and general symptoms to work with self-copying paper emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes these symptoms have been related to sick building syndrome sbs which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes skin and upper airways headache and fatigue many of the symptoms described in sbs and multiple chemical sensitivity mcs resemble the symptoms known to be elicited by airborne irritant chemicals a repeated measurement design was employed in the study of acute symptoms of eye and respiratory tract irritation resulting from occupational exposure to sodium borate dusts the symptom assessment of the 79 exposed and 27 unexposed subjects comprised interviews before the shift began and then at regular hourly intervals for the next six hours of the shift four days in a row exposures were monitored concurrently with a personal real time aerosol monitor two different exposure profiles a daily average and short term 15 minute average were used in the analysis exposure-response relations were evaluated by linking incidence rates for each symptom with categories of exposure acute incidence rates for nasal eye and throat irritation and coughing and breathlessness were found to be associated with increased exposure levels of both exposure indices steeper exposure-response slopes were seen when short term exposure concentrations were used results from multivariate logistic regression analysis suggest that current smokers tended to be less sensitive to the exposure to airborne sodium borate dust several actions can be taken to prevent eye irritation trying to maintain normal blinking by avoiding room temperatures that are too high avoiding relative humidities that are too high or too low because they reduce blink frequency or may increase water evaporation trying to maintain an intact film of tears by the following actions 1 blinking and short breaks may be beneficial for vdu users increasing these two actions might help maintain the tear film 2 downward gazing is recommended to reduce ocular surface area and water evaporation 3 the distance between the vdu and keyboard should be kept as short as possible to minimize evaporation from the ocular surface area by a low direction of the gaze and 4 blink training can be beneficial 1 blinking and short breaks may be beneficial for vdu users increasing these two actions might help maintain the tear film 2 downward gazing is recommended to reduce ocular surface area and water evaporation 3 the distance between the vdu and keyboard should be kept as short as possible to minimize evaporation from the ocular surface area by a low

should be used with care eye disease there are many diseases disorders and age-related changes that may affect the eyes and surrounding structures as the eye ages certain changes occur that can be attributed solely to the aging process most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline with aging the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye while there are many changes of significance in the non-diseased eye the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability presbyopia the area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina the extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina in comparison to younger people it is as though older persons are constantly wearing medium-density sunglasses therefore for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination older persons require extra lighting certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and genital warts if contact between the eye and area of infection occurs the std can be transmitted to the eye with aging a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called arcus senilis aging causes laxity downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat these changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as ectropion entropion dermatochalasis and ptosis the vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction posterior vitreous detachment or pvd and its opacities visible as floaters gradually increase in number various eye care professionals including ophthalmologists eye doctorssurgeons optometrists and opticians are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders a snellen chart is one type of eye chart used to measure visual acuity at the conclusion of a complete eye examination the eye doctor might provide the patient with an eyeglass prescription for corrective lenses some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include myopia near-sightedness which affects about one-third of the human population hyperopia far-sightedness which affects about one quarter of the population astigmatism and presbyopia the loss of focusing range during aging macular degeneration macular degeneration is especially prevalent in the us and affects roughly 175 million americans each year having lower levels of lutein and zeaxanthin within the macula may be associated with an increase in the risk of age-related macular degeneration lutein and zeaxanthin act as antioxidants that protect the retina and macula from oxidative damage from high-energy light waves as the light waves enter the eye they excite electrons that can cause harm to the cells in the eye but before they can cause oxidative damage that may lead to macular degeneration or cataracts lutein and zeaxanthin bind to the electron free radical and are reduced rendering the electron safe there are many ways to ensure a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin the best of which is to eat dark green vegetables including kale spinach broccoli and turnip greens nutrition is an important aspect of the ability to achieve and maintain proper eye health lutein and zeaxanthin are two major carotenoids found in the macula of the eye that are being researched to identify their role in the pathogenesis of eye disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and
