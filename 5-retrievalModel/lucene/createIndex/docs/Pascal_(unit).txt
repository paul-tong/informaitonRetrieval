the pascal symbol pa is the si derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure stress youngs modulus and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre it is named after the french polymath blaise pascal common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal 1hpa 100pa which is equal to one millibar and the kilopascal 1kpa 1000pa which is equal to one centibar the unit of measurement called standard atmosphere atm is defined as 101325pa meteorological reports in the united states typically state atmospheric pressure in millibars in canada these reports are given in terms of kilopascals etymology the unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre nm by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971 definition the pascal can be expressed using si derived units or alternatively solely si base units as where n is the newton m is the metre kg is the kilogram s is the second and j is the joule one pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre standard units the unit of measurement called an atmosphere or a standard atmosphere atm is 101325pa 101325kpa this value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards such as the international organization for standardizations iso2787 pneumatic tools and compressors iso2533 aerospace and iso5024 petroleum in contrast international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommends the use of 100kpa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances unicode has dedicated code-points u33a9 square pa and u33aa square kpa in the cjk compatibility block but these exist only for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated uses the pascal pa or kilopascal kpa as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch psi unit except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the us customary system including the united states geophysicists use the gigapascal gpa in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the earth medical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and often displays the youngs modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals in materials science and engineering the pascal measures the stiffness tensile strength and compressive strength of materials in engineering use because the pascal represents a very small quantity the megapascal mpa is the preferred unit for these uses the pascal is also equivalent to the si unit of energy density jm this applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases but also to the energy density of electric magnetic and gravitational fields in measurements of sound pressure or loudness of sound one pascal is equal to 94 decibels spl the quietest sound a human can hear known as the threshold of hearing is 0dbspl or 20pa the airtightness of buildings is measured at 50pa hectopascal and millibar units the units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar which was close to the average air pressure on earth and the millibar since the introduction of si units meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals hpa unit equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar exceptions include canada which use kilopascals kpa in many other fields of science the si is preferred which means pa with a prefix in multiples of 1000 is preferred many countries also use the millibars in practically all other fields the kilopascal 1000 pascals is used instead see also atmospheric pressure which gives the usage of the hbar end the mbar centimetre of water meteorology metric prefix orders of magnitude pressure pascals law pressure measurement
