took control of the region in the 16th century during the spanish colonial period bolivia was administered by the royal audiencia of charcas spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from bolivias mines after the first call for independence in 1809 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the republic named for simn bolvar over the course of the 19th and early 20th century bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the seizure of its coastline by chile in 1879 bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971 when hugo banzer led a coup dtat which replaced the socialist government of juan jos torres with a military dictatorship headed by banzer torres was murdered in buenos aires

mining and manufacturing goods such as textiles clothing refined metals and refined petroleum bolivia is very rich in minerals including tin silver and lithium etymology bolivia is named after simn bolvar a leader in the spanish american wars of independence the leader of venezuela antonio jos de sucre had been given the option by bolvar to either unite charcas present-day bolivia with the newly formed republic of peru to unite with the united provinces of rio de la plata or to formally declare its independence from spain as a wholly independent state sucre opted to create a brand new state and on 6 august 1825 with local support named it in honor of simn bolvar the original name was republic of bolvar some days later congressman manuel martn cruz proposed if from romulus comes rome then from bolvar comes bolivia spanish si de rmulo roma de bolvar bolivia the name was approved by the republic on 3 october 1825 in 2009 a new constitution changed the countrys official name to plurinational state of bolivia in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of bolivias indigenous peoples under the new constitution history pre-colonial the region now known as bolivia had been occupied for over 2500 years when the aymara arrived however present-day aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the tiwanaku culture which had its capital at tiwanaku in western bolivia the capital city of tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 bc when it was a small agriculturally based village the community grew to urban proportions between ad 600 and ad 800 becoming an important regional power in the southern andes according to early estimates the city covered approximately 65 square kilometers 25 square miles at its maximum extent and had between 15000 and 30000 inhabitants in 1996 satellite imaging was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus flooded raised fields across the three primary valleys of tiwanaku arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285000 and 1482000 people around ad 400 tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in peru bolivia and chile tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects in order to expand its reach tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness creating colonies fostering trade agreements which made the other cultures rather dependent and instituting state cults the empire continued to grow with no end in sight william h isbell states tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between ad 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the tiwanaku empire tiwanakus power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire tiwanakus elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace further this elites control of llama herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery these herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites through this control and manipulation of surplus resources the elites power continued to grow until about ad 950 at this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred causing a significant drop in precipitation in the titicaca basin believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought as the rainfall decreased many of the cities farther away from lake titicaca began to tender fewer foodstuffs to the elites as the surplus of food decreased and thus the amount available to underpin their power the control of the elites began to falter the capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture tiwanaku disappeared around ad 1000 because food production the main source of the elites power dried up the area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter between 1438 and 1527 the inca empire during its expansion from its capital at cuzco peru it gained control over much of what is now andean bolivia and extended its control into the fringes of the amazon basin colonial period the spanish conquest of the inca empire began in 1524 and was mostly completed by 1533 the territory now called bolivia was known as charcas and was under the authority of the viceroy of lima local government came from the audiencia de charcas located in chuquisaca la platamodern sucre founded in 1545 as a mining town potos soon produced fabulous wealth becoming the largest city in the new world with a population exceeding 150000 people by the late 16th century bolivian silver was an important source of revenue for the spanish empire a steady stream of natives served as labor force under the brutal slave conditions of the spanish version of the pre-columbian draft system called the mita charcas was transferred to the viceroyalty of the ro de la plata in 1776 and the people from buenos aires the capital of the viceroyalty coined the term upper peru spanish alto per as a popular reference to the royal audiencia of charcas tpac katari led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to la paz in march 1781 during which 20000 people died as spanish royal authority weakened during the napoleonic wars sentiment against colonial rule grew independence and subsequent wars the struggle for independence started in the city of sucre on 25 may 1809 and the chuquisaca revolution chuquisaca was then the name of the city is known as the first cry of freedom in latin america that revolution was followed by the la paz revolution on 16 july 1809 the la paz revolution marked a complete split with the spanish government while the chuquisaca revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the spanish king deposed by napoleon bonaparte both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the spanish authorities in the viceroyalty of the rio de la plata but the following year the spanish american wars of independence raged across the continent bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the royalists and patriots buenos aires sent three military campaigns all of which were defeated and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at salta bolivia was finally freed of royalist dominion by antonio jos de sucre with a military campaign coming from the north in support of the campaign of simn bolvar after 16 years of war the republic was proclaimed on 6 august 1825 in 1836 bolivia under the rule of marshal andrs de santa cruz invaded peru to reinstall the deposed president general luis jos de orbegoso peru and bolivia formed the peru-bolivian confederation with de santa cruz as the supreme protector following tension between the confederation and chile chile declared war on 28 december 1836 argentina separately declared war on the confederation on 9 may 1837 the peruvian-bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the war of the confederation the defeat of the argentine expedition and the defeat of the first chilean expedition on the fields of paucarpata near the city of arequipa at the outset of the war the chilean and peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the paucarpata treaty the treaty stipulated that chile would withdraw from peru-bolivia chile would return captured confederate ships economic relations would be normalized and the confederation would pay peruvian debt to chile in chile the government and public rejected the peace treaty chile organized a second attack on the confederation and defeated it in the battle of yungay after this defeat santa cruz resigned and went to exile in ecuador and then paris and the peruvian-bolivian confederation was dissolved following the renewed independence of peru peruvian president general agustn gamarra invaded bolivia the peruvian army was decisively defeated at the battle of ingavi on 20 november 1841 where gamarra was killed the bolivian army under general jos ballivin then mounted a counter-offensive capturing the peruvian port of arica later both sides signed a peace treaty in 1842 putting a final end to the war a period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened bolivia in addition during the war of the pacific 187983 chile occupied vast territories rich in natural resources south west of bolivia including the bolivian coast chile took control of todays chuquicamata area the adjoining rich salitre saltpeter fields and the port of antofagasta among other bolivian territories thus since independence bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries it also lost the state of acre in the acre war important because this region was known for its production of rubber peasants and the bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories and facing the prospect of a total war against brazil it was forced to sign the treaty of petrpolis in 1903 in which bolivia lost this rich territory popular myth has it that bolivian president mariano melgarejo 186471 traded the land for what he called a magnificent white horse and acre was subsequently flooded by brazilians which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with brazil in the late 19th century an increase in the world price of silver brought bolivia relative prosperity and political stability early 20th century during the early 20th century tin replaced silver as the countrys most important source of wealth a succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed laissez-faire capitalist policies through the first 30 years of the 20th century living conditions of the native people who constitute most of the population remained deplorable with work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status they had no access to education economic opportunity and political participation bolivias defeat by paraguay in the chaco war 193235 where bolivia lost a great part of the gran chaco region in dispute marked a turning-point the revolutionary nationalist movement mnr the most historic political party emerged as a broad-based party denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections the mnr led a successful revolution in 1952 under president vctor paz estenssoro the mnr having strong popular pressure introduced universal suffrage into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the countrys largest tin mines late 20th century twelve years of tumultuous rule left the mnr divided in 1964 a military junta overthrew president estenssoro at the outset of his third term the 1969 death of president ren barrientos ortuo a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966 led to a succession of weak governments alarmed by the rising popular assembly and the increase in the popularity of president juan jos torres the military the mnr and others installed colonel later general hugo banzer surez as president in 1971 he returned to the presidency in 1997 through 2001 the united states central intelligence agency cia had been active in providing finances and training to the bolivian military dictatorship in the 1960s the revolutionary leader che guevara was killed by a team of cia officers and members of the bolivian army on 9 october 1967 in bolivia flix rodrguez was a cia officer on the team with the bolivian army that captured and shot guevara rodriguez said that after he received a bolivian presidential execution order he told the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully to remain consistent with the bolivian governments story that che had been killed in action during a clash with the bolivian army rodriguez said the us government had wanted che in panama and i could have tried to falsify the command to the troops and got che to panama as the us government said they had wanted but that he had chosen to let history run its course as desired by bolivia elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud there were coups dtat counter-coups and caretaker governments in 1980 general luis garca meza tejada carried out a ruthless and violent coup dtat that did not have popular support he pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year at the end of the year he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced bueno me quedo or all right ill stay in office after a military rebellion forced out meza in 1981 three other military governments in 14 months struggled with bolivias growing problems unrest forced the military to convoke the congress elected in 1980 and allow it to choose a new chief executive in october 1982 hernn siles zuazo again became president 22 years after the end of his first term of office 195660 democratic transition gonzalo snchez de lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda the most dramatic reform was privatization under the capitalization program under which investors typically foreign acquired 50 ownership and management control of public enterprises in return for agreed upon capital investments in 1993 gonzalo snchez de lozada ran for president in alliance with the tupac katari revolutionary liberation movement which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies in 1993 sanchez de lozada introduced the plan de todos which led to the decentralization of government introduction of intercultural bilingual education implementation of agrarian legislation and privatization of state owned businesses the plan explicitly stated that bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51 of enterprises under the plan most state-owned enterprises soes though not mines were sold this privatization of soes led to a neoliberal structuring the law of popular participation dumped upon municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures and offering services health education systems of irrigation without support from the state the reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests particularly in la paz and the chapare coca-growing region from 1994 through 1996 the indigenous population of the andean region was not able to benefit from government reforms during this time the umbrella labor-organization of bolivia the central obrera boliviana cob became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy a teachers strike in 1995 was defeated because the cob could not marshal the support of many of its members including construction and factory workers 1997-2002 general banzer presidency in the 1997 elections general hugo banzer leader of the nationalist democratic action party adn and former dictator 197178 won 22 of the vote while the mnr candidate won 18 at the outset of his government president banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to eradicate physically the illegal coca of the chapare region the mir of jaime paz zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the banzer government supporting this policy called the dignity plan the banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor the relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office after that regional global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth financial crises in argentina and brazil lower world prices for export commodities and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the bolivian economy the public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption these factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of banzers term between january 1999 and april 2000 large-scale protests erupted in cochabamba bolivias third largest city in response to the privatisation of water resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices on 6 august 2001 banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer he died less than a year later vice president jorge fernando quiroga ramrez completed the final year of his term in the june 2002 national elections former president gonzalo snchez de lozada mnr placed first with 225 of the vote followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader evo morales movement toward socialism mas with 209 a july agreement between the mnr and the fourth-place mir which had again been led in the election by former president jaime paz zamora virtually ensured the election of snchez de lozada in the congressional run-off and on 6 august he was sworn in for the second time the mnr platform featured three overarching objectives economic reactivation and job creation anti-corruption and social inclusion in 2003 the bolivian gas conflict broke out on 12 october 2003 the government imposed martial law in el alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed sanchez de lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of congress after his resignation was accepted and his vice president carlos mesa invested he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the united states the countrys internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage after a resurgence of gas protests in 2005 carlos mesa attempted to resign in january 2005 but his offer was refused by congress on 22 march 2005 after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing mesa of bowing to us corporate interests mesa again offered his resignation to congress which was accepted on 10 june the chief justice of the supreme court eduardo rodrguez was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing carlos mesa 2005 morales presidency and re-nationalization of petroleum assets evo morales won the 2005 presidential election with 537 of the votes an absolute majority unusual in bolivian elections on 1 may 2006 morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to re-nationalize bolivian hydrocarbon assets fulfilling a campaign promise on 6 august 2006 morales opened the bolivian constituent assembly to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority in august 2007 more conflicts arose in sucre as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable in may 2008 evo morales was a signatory to the unasur constitutive treaty of the union of south american nations in the 2009 national general elections evo morales was re-elected with 6422 of the vote his party movement for socialism also won a two-thirds majority in both

worlds 28th-largest country and the fifth largest country in south america extending from the central andes through part of the gran chaco pantanal and as far as the amazon the geographic center of the country is the so-called puerto estrella star port on the ro grande in uflo de chvez province santa cruz department the geography of the country exhibits a great variety of terrain and climates bolivia has a high level of biodiversity considered one of the greatest in the world as well as several ecoregions with ecological sub-units such as the altiplano tropical rainforests including amazon rainforest dry valleys and the chiquitania which is a tropical savanna these areas feature enormous variations in altitude from an elevation of 6542 metres 21463ft above sea level in nevado sajama to nearly 70 metres 230ft along the paraguay river although a country of great geographic diversity bolivia has remained a landlocked country since the war of the pacific puerto surez san matas and puerto quijarro are located in the bolivian pantanal bolivia can be divided into three physiographic regions the andean region in the southwest spans 28 of the national territory extending over 307603 square kilometres 118766sqmi this area is located above 3000 metres 9800ft altitude and is located between two big andean chains the cordillera occidental western range and the cordillera central central range with some of the highest spots in the americas such as the nevado sajama with an altitude of 6542 metres 21463ft and the illimani at 6462 metres 21201ft also located in the cordillera central is lake titicaca the highest commercially navigable lake in the world and the largest lake in south america the lake is shared with peru also in this region are the altiplano and the salar de uyuni which is the largest salt flat in the world and an important source of lithium the sub-andean region in the center and south of the country is an intermediate region between the altiplano and the eastern llanos plain this region comprises 13 of the territory of bolivia extending over 142815km 55141sqmi and encompassing the bolivian valleys and the yungas region it is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate the llanos region in the northeast comprises 59 of the territory with 648163km 250257sqmi it is located to the north of the cordillera central and extends from the andean foothills to the paraguay river it is a region of flat land and small plateaus all covered by extensive rain forests containing enormous biodiversity the region is below 400 metres 1300ft above sea level bolivia has three drainage basins the first is the amazon basin also called the north basin 724000km 280000sqmi66 of the territory the rivers of this basin generally have big meanders which form lakes such as murillo lake in pando department the main bolivian tributary to the amazon basin is the mamor river with a length of 2000km 1200mi running north to the confluence with the beni river 1113km 692mi in length and the second most important river of the country the beni river along with the madeira river forms the main tributary of the amazon river from east to west the basin is formed by other important rivers such as the madre de dios river the orthon river the abuna river the yata river and the guapor river the most important lakes are rogaguado lake rogagua lake and jara lake the second is the ro de la plata basin also called the south basin 229500km 88600sqmi21 of the territory the tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the amazon basin the rio de la plata basin is mainly formed by the paraguay river pilcomayo river and bermejo river the most important lakes are uberaba lake and mandior lake both located in the bolivian marshland the third basin is the central basin which is an endorheic basin 145081 square kilometres 56016sqmi13 of the territory the altiplano has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the andean mountains the most important river is the desaguadero river with a length of 436km 271mi the longest river of the altiplano it begins in lake titicaca and then runs in a southeast direction to poop lake the basin is then formed by lake titicaca lake poop the desaguadero river and great salt flats including the salar de uyuni and coipasa lake geology the geology of bolivia comprises a variety of different lithologies as well as tectonic and sedimentary environments on a synoptic scale geological units coincide with topographical units most elementally the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the subduction processes in the pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable platforms and shields climate the climate of bolivia varies drastically from one eco-region to the other from the tropics in the eastern llanos to a polar climate in the western andes the summers are warm humid in the east and dry in the west with rains that often modify temperatures humidity winds atmospheric pressure and evaporation yielding very different climates in different areas when the climatological phenomenon known as el nio takes place it causes great alterations in the weather winters are very cold in the west and it snows in the mountain ranges while in the western regions windy days are more common the autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions llanos a humid tropical climate with an average temperature of 25c 77f the wind coming from the amazon rainforest causes significant rainfall in may there is low precipitation because of dry winds and most days have clear skies even so winds from the south called surazos can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days altiplano desert-polar climates with strong and cold winds the average temperature ranges from 15 to 20c at night temperatures descend drastically to slightly above 0c while during the day the weather is dry and solar radiation is high ground frosts occur every month and snow is frequent valleys and yungas temperate climate the humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains making this region very humid and rainy temperatures are cooler at higher elevations snow occurs at altitudes of 2000 metres 6600ft chaco subtropical semi-arid climate rainy and humid in january and the rest of the year with warm days and cool nights issues with climate change bolivia is especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of climate change twenty percent of the worlds tropical glaciers are located within the country and are more sensitive to change in temperature due to the tropical climate they are located in temperatures in the andes increase by 01c per decade from 1939 to 1998 and have begun to triple 033c annually from 1980 to 2005 causing glaciers to recede at an accelerated pace and create unforeseen water shortages in andean agricultural towns farmers have taken to temporary city jobs when there is poor yield for their crops while others have started permanently leaving the agricultural sector and are migrating to nearby towns for other forms of work some view these migrants as the first generation of climate refugees cities that neighbor agricultural land like el alto face the challenge of providing services to the influx of new migrants because there is no alternative water source the citys water source is now being constricted bolivias government and other agencies have acknowledged the need to instill new policies battling the effects of climate change the world bank has provided funding through the climate investment funds cif and are using the pilot program for climate resilience ppcr ii to construct new irrigation systems protect riverbanks and basins and work on building water resources with the help of indigenous communities bolivia has also implemented the bolivian strategy on climate change which is based on taking action in these four areas promoting clean development in bolivia by introducing technological changes in the agriculture forestry and industrial sectors aimed to reduce ghg emissions with a positive impact on development contributing to carbon management in forests wetlands and other managed natural ecosystems increasing effectiveness in energy supply and use to mitigate effects of ghg emissions and risk of contingencies focus on increased and efficient observations and understanding of environmental changes in bolivia to develop effective and timely responses biodiversity bolivia with an enormous variety of organisms and ecosystems is part of the like-minded megadiverse countries bolivias variable altitudes ranging from 906542 metres 29521463ft above sea level allow for a vast biologic diversity the territory of bolivia comprises four types of biomes 32 ecological regions and 199 ecosystems within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves such as the noel kempff mercado national park the madidi national park the tunari national park the eduardo avaroa andean fauna national reserve and the kaa-iya del gran chaco national park and integrated management natural area among others bolivia boasts over 17000 species of seed plants including over 1200 species of fern 1500 species of marchantiophyta and moss and at least 800 species of fungus in addition there are more than 3000

elected governments since 1982 prior to that it was governed by various dictatorships presidents hernn siles zuazo 198285 and vctor paz estenssoro 198589 began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests gonzalo snchez de lozada in 2003 and carlos mesa in 2005 bolivias multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament although the revolutionary nationalist movement nationalist democratic action and the revolutionary left movement predominated from 1985 to 2005 the current president is evo morales the first indigenous bolivian to serve as head of state morales movement for socialism political instrument for the sovereignty of the peoples party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades doing so both in 2005 and 2009 the constitution drafted in 200607 and approved in 2009 provides for balanced executive legislative judicial and electoral powers as well as several levels of autonomy the traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the congress whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive the judiciary consisting of the supreme court and departmental and lower courts has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency through revisions to the constitution in 1994 and subsequent laws the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments municipalities and indigenous territories the executive branch is headed by a president and vice president and consists of a variable number currently 20 of government ministries the president is elected to a five-year term by popular vote and governs from the presidential palace popularly called the burnt palace palacio quemado in la paz in the case that no candidate receives an absolute majority of the popular

alto per later bolivia on 1 july 1826 on 12 july 1839 president jos miguel de velasco proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of bolivia and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader antonio jos de sucre the bolivian seat of government moved to la paz at the start of the twentieth century as a consequence of sucres relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of potos and its silver industry and of the liberal party in the war of 1899 the 2009 constitution assigns the role of national capital to sucre not referring to la paz in the text in addition to being the constitutional capital the supreme court of bolivia is located in sucre making it the judicial capital nonetheless the palacio quemado the presidential palace and seat of bolivian executive power

development banks most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the paris club mechanism external creditors have been willing to do this because the bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by imf programs since 1987 though economic crises have undercut bolivias normally good record however by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to brazil and argentina of natural gas the income from tourism has become

sanitation throughout the country low access to water in rural areas insufficient and ineffective investments a low visibility of community service providers a lack of respect of indigenous customs technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure an institutional framework that is not consistent with
