pedro lvares cabral european portuguesepeu avr ka or brazilian portuguesepedu awvais kabaw c1467 or 1468 c1520 was a portuguese nobleman military commander navigator and explorer regarded as the european discoverer of brazil in 1500 cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of south america and claimed it for portugal while details of cabrals early life remain unclear it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education he was appointed to head an expedition to india in 1500 following vasco da gamas newly-opened route around africa the undertaking had the aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in indiabypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of arab turkish and italian merchants although the previous expedition of vasco da gama to india on its sea route had recorded signs of land west of the southern atlantic ocean in 1497 cabral led the first known expedition to have touched four continents europe africa america and asia his fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western atlantic ocean perhaps intentionally and made landfall april 1500 on what he initially assumed to be a large island as the new land was within the portuguese sphere according to the 1494 treaty of tordesillas cabral claimed it for the portuguese crown he explored the coast realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent and dispatched a ship to notify king manuel i of the new territory the continent was south america and the land he had claimed for portugal later came to be known as brazil the fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to india a storm in the southern atlantic caused the loss of several ships and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the mozambique channel before proceeding to calicut in india cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights but arab merchants saw portugals venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both muslims and hindus on the portuguese entrept the portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack from calicut the expedition sailed to the kingdom of cochin another indian city-state where cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to europe despite the loss of human lives and ships cabrals voyage was deemed a success upon his return to portugal the extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the portuguese crowns finances and helped lay the foundation of a portuguese empire that would stretch from the americas to the far east cabral was later passed over possibly as a result of a quarrel with manuel i when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in india having lost favor with the king he retired to a private life of which few records survive his accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years decades after brazils independence from portugal in the 19th century cabrals reputation began to be rehabilitated by emperor pedro ii of brazil historians have long argued whether cabral was brazils discoverer and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional the first question has been settled by the observation that the few cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become brazil the sole portuguese-speaking nation in the americas on the second question no definite consensus has been formed and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof nevertheless although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers historians consider cabral to be a major figure of the age of discovery early life little is certain regarding pedro lvares cabrals life before or following his voyage which led to the discovery of brazil he was born in 1467 or 1468the former year being the most likelyat belmonte about 30 kilometres 19mi from present-day covilh in central portugal he was a son of ferno lvares cabral and isabel gouveiaone of five boys and six girls in the family cabral was christened pedro lvares de gouveia and only later supposedly upon his elder brothers death in 1503 did he begin using his fathers surname the coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver purple represented fidelity and the goats were derived from the family name cabral pertains to goats in english however only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family arms family lore said that the cabrais were descendants of caranus the legendary first king of macedonia caranus was in turn a supposed 7th-generation scion of the demigod hercules myths aside the historian james mcclymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of cabrals family according to that tradition the cabrais derive from a castilian clan named the cabreiras cabra is spanish for goat who bore a similar coat of arms the cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century lvaro gil cabral cabrals great-great-grandfather and a frontier military commander was one of the few portuguese nobles to remain loyal to dom joo i king of portugal during the war against the king of castile as a reward joo i presented lvaro gil with the hereditary fiefdom of belmonte raised as a member of the lower nobility cabral was sent to the court of king dom afonso v in 1479 at around age 12 he received an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and fight he would have been roughly age 17 on 30 june 1484 when he was named moo fidalgo young nobleman a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles by king dom joo ii records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary but cabral may have campaigned in north africa as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day king dom manuel i who had acceded to the throne two years previously awarded him an annual allowance worth 30000 reais on 12 april 1497 he was concurrently given the title fidalgo nobleman in the kings council and was named a knight of the order of christ there is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of cabral it is known that he had a strong build and matched his fathers height of 190 meters 6ft 28in cabrals character has been described as well-learned courteous prudent generous tolerant with enemies humble but also vain and too concerned with the respect he felt his honor and position demanded discovery of brazil fleet commander-in-chief on 15 february 1500 cabral was appointed capito-mor literally major-captain or commander-in-chief of a fleet sailing for india it was then the custom for the portuguese crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands regardless of experience or professional competence this was the case for the captains of the ships under cabrals commandmost were nobles like himself the practice had obvious pitfalls since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as afonso de albuquerque or dom joo de castro scant details have survived regarding the criteria used by the portuguese government in its selection of cabral as head of the india expedition in the royal decree naming him commander-in-chief the only reasons given are merits and services nothing more is known about these qualifications historian william greenlee argued that king manuel i had undoubtedly known him well at court that along with the standing of the cabral family their unquestioned loyalty to the crown the personal appearance of cabral and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important factors also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the kings council given the political intrigue present at court cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment the historian malyn newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of cabral was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions cabral became the military chief while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters the most important of these were bartolomeu dias diogo dias and nicolau coelho they would along with the other captains command 13 ships and 1500 men of this contingent 700 were soldiers although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat the fleet had two divisions the first division was composed of nine naus carracks and two round caravels and was headed to calicut today more often known as kozhikode in india with the goal of establishing trade relations and a factory trading post the second division consisting of one nau and one round caravel set sail for the port of sofala in what is today mozambique in exchange for leading the fleet cabral was entitled to 10000 cruzados an old portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35kg of gold and the right to purchase 30 tonnes 33 short tons 30 long tons of pepper at his own expense for transport back to europe the pepper could then be resold tax-free to the portuguese crown he was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice duty-free although the voyage was extremely hazardous cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to portugal with the cargo spices were then rare in europe and keenly sought-after an earlier fleet had been the first to reach india by circumnavigating africa that expedition had been led by vasco da gama and returned to portugal in 1499 for decades portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the east in order to bypass the mediterranean sea which was under the control of the italian maritime republics and the ottoman empire portugals expansionism would lead first to a route to india and later to worldwide colonization a desire to spread catholic christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration there also was a long tradition of pushing back muslims which stemmed from portugals fight for nationhood against the moors the fight expanded first to north africa and eventually to the indian subcontinent an additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical prester johna powerful christian king with whom an alliance against islam could be forged finally the portuguese crown sought a share in the lucrative west african trade in slaves and gold and indias spice trade departure and arrival in a new land the fleet under the command of the 3233-year-old cabral departed from lisbon on 9 march 1500 at noon the previous day it had been given a public send-off which included a mass and celebrations attended by the king his court and a huge crowd on the morning of 14 march the flotilla passed gran canaria in the canary islands it sailed onward to cape verde a portuguese colony situated on the west african coast which was reached on 22 march the next day a nau commanded by vasco de atade with 150 men disappeared without a trace the fleet crossed the equator on 9 april and sailed westward as far as possible from the african continent in what was known as the volta do mar literally turn of the sea navigational technique seaweed was sighted on 21 april which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast they were proven correct the next afternoon wednesday 22 april 1500 when the fleet anchored near what cabral christened the monte pascoal easter mount it being the week of easter the spot is on the northeast coast of present-day brazil the portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore and all ships captains gathered aboard cabrals lead ship on 23 april cabral ordered nicolau coelho a captain who had experience from vasco da gamas voyage to india to go ashore and make contact he set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people after coelho returned cabral took the fleet north where after traveling 65 kilometres 40mi along the coast it anchored on 24 april in what the commander-in-chief named porto seguro safe port the place was a natural harbor and afonso lopes pilot of the lead ship brought two natives aboard to confer with cabral as in the first contact the meeting was friendly and cabral presented the locals with gifts the inhabitants were stone age hunter-gatherers to whom the europeans assigned the generic label indians the men collected food by stalking game fishing and foraging while the women engaged in small-scale farming they were divided into countless rival tribes the tribe which cabral met was the tupiniquim some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentaryhaving a knowledge of fire but not metalworking a few tribes engaged in cannibalism on 26 april as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a christian mass was heldthe first celebrated on the soil of what would later become brazil he along with the ships crews participated the following days were spent stockpiling water food wood and other provisions the portuguese also built a massiveperhaps 7 metres 23ft longwooden cross cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between portugal and spain that had been specified in the treaty of tordesillas the territory was thus within the sphere allotted to portugal to solemnize portugals claim to the land the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1 may in honor of the cross cabral named the newly discovered land ilha de vera cruz island of the true cross the next day a supply ship under the command of either gaspar de lemos or andr gonalves the sources conflict on who was sent returned to portugal to apprise the king of the discovery voyage to india tragedy off southern africa the fleet resumed its voyage on either 2 or 3 may 1500 and sailed along the east coast of south america cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent rather than an island around 5 may the fleet veered eastwards towards africa on 23 or 24 may they encountered a storm in the south atlantics high-pressure zone resulting in the loss of four ships the exact location of the disaster is unknownspeculations range from near the cape of good hope at the southern tip of the african continent to within sight of the south american coast three naus and a caravel commanded by bartolomeu diasthe first european to reach the cape of good hope in 1488foundered and 380 men were lost the remaining vessels hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging were separated one ship that had been separated commanded by diogo dias wandered onward alone and the other six ships were able to regroup they gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each and cabrals group sailed east past the cape of good hope fixing their position and sighting land they turned north and landed somewhere in the primeiras and segundas archipelago off east africa and north of sofala the main fleet remained near sofala ten days undergoing repairs the expedition then went north and on 26 may reached kilwa kisiwani where cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king from kilwa kisiwani the fleet departed to malindi which was reached on 2 august cabral met with its king with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts pilots were recruited at malindi for the last leg to india and the fleet set sail land was reached at anjadip an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to calicut here the ships were beached recaulked and painted final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of calicut massacre in calicut the fleet departed anjadip and arrived in calicut on 13 september cabral successfully negotiated with the zamorin the title of the ruler of calicut and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse in hopes of further improving relations cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the zamorins request however on 16 or 17 december the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 according to other accounts perhaps as many as several thousand muslim arabs and hindu indians despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen more than 50 portuguese were killed the remaining defenders retreated to the ships some by swimming thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous arab merchants cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of calicut but no apology was forthcoming the portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire cabral also ordered his ships to bombard calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement the massacre was blamed in part on portuguese animosity towards muslims which had developed over centuries of conflict with the moors on the iberian peninsula and in north africa moreover the portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish the arabs also had no desire to allow the portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices the portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade the letter from king manuel i brought by cabral to the ruler of calicut which was translated by the rulers arab interpreters sought the exclusion of arab traders the muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods and attempted to sway the hindu ruler against the portuguese the portuguese and arabs were extremely suspicious of each others every action historian william greenlee has argued that the portuguese realized that they were few in numbers and that those who would come to india in the future fleets would always be at numerical disadvantage so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the portuguese would be feared and respected in the future it was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end thus they created a precedent for european behavior in asia during the following centuries return to europe warnings in reports from vasco da gamas voyage to india had prompted king manuel i to brief cabral regarding another port to the south of calicut where he could also trade this city was kochi and the fleet set sail reaching it on 24 december kochi was nominally a vassal of calicut as well as being dominated by other indian cities kochi was eager to achieve independence and the portuguese were willing to exploit indian disunityas the british would three hundred years later this tactic eventually ensured portuguese hegemony over the region cabral forged an alliance with kochis ruler as well with rulers of other indian cities and was able to establish a factory at last loaded with precious spices the fleet went to kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to portugal on 16 january 1501 the expedition headed for the east coast of africa one of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder as there was no space in the other ships its cargo was lost and cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire the fleet then proceeded to the island of mozambique northeast of sofala in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the cape of good hope one caravel was sent to sofalaanother of the expeditions goals a second caravel considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by nicolau coelho was sent ahead to give the king advance notice of the voyages success a third vessel commanded by pedro de atade became separated from the fleet after leaving mozambique on 22 may the fleetnow reduced to only two shipsrounded the cape of good hope they arrived in beseguiche now dakar located near cape verde on 2 june there they found not only nicolau coelhos caravel but also the nau captained by diogo diaswhich had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the south atlantic the nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboardone of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades another portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in beseguiche after manuel i had been told of the discovery of what is now brazil he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it one of its navigators was amerigo vespucci for whom the americas would be named who told cabral of his exploration confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island nicolau coelhos caravel departed first from beseguiche and arrived in portugal on 23 june 1501 cabral stayed behind waiting for pedro de atades missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to sofala both eventually appeared and cabral arrived in portugal on 21 july 1501 with the other vessels coming home during the following days in all two ships returned empty five were fully loaded and six were lost nonetheless the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800 profit to the portuguese crown once sold the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained asserts historian james mcclymont when cabral reached the east african coast pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage few voyages to brazil and india were so well executed as cabrals affirmed historian bailey diffie which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement of a portuguese seagoing empire from africa to the far east and eventually to a land empire in brazil later years and death upon cabrals return king manuel i began planning another fleet to make the journey to india and to avenge the portuguese losses in calicut cabral was selected to command this revenge fleet as it was called for eight months cabral made all preparations but for reasons which remain uncertain he was relieved of command it had apparently been proposed to give another navigator vicente sodr independent command over a section of the fleet and cabral strongly opposed this whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command the result was that when the fleet departed in march 1502 its commander was vasco da gamaa maternal nephew of vicente sodrand not cabral it is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da gama and another supporting cabral at some point cabral left the court permanently the king was greatly irritated by the feud to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment as it did for one of da gamas supporters despite the loss of favor with manuel i cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to dona lady isabel de castro a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of king dom fernando i of portugal her mother was a sister of afonso de albuquerque one of the greatest portuguese military leaders during the age of discovery the couple had at least four children two boys ferno lvares cabral and antnio cabral and two girls catarina de castro and guiomar de castro there were two additional daughters named isabel and leonor according to other sources which also say that guiomar isabel and leonor joined religious orders afonso de albuquerque attempted to intercede on cabrals behalf and on 2 december 1514 asked manuel i to forgive him and allow his return to court but to no avail suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor possibly malaria since his voyage cabral withdrew to santarm in 1509 he spent his remaining years there only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time according to a royal letter dated 17 december 1509 cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service in 1518 or perhaps previously he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the kings council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2437 reais this was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497 and still being paid cabral died of unspecified causes most probably in 1520 he was buried in the so joo evangelista chapel of the convento da graa in santarm legacy posthumous rehabilitation the first permanent portuguese settlement in the land which would become brazil was so vicente which was established in 1532 by martim afonso de sousa as the years passed the portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward conquering more lands from both indigenous americans and the spanish brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by portugal as the most important part of its far-flung maritime empire on 7 september 1822 the heir of portuguese king dom joo vi secured the independence of brazil from portugal and as dom pedro i became its first emperor cabrals discovery and even his resting place in the land of his birth had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition this began to change beginning in the 1840s when emperor dom pedro ii successor and son of pedro i sponsored research and publications dealing with cabrals life and expedition through the brazilian historic and geographic institute this was part of the emperors ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among brazils diverse citizenrygiving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique portuguese-speaking empire surrounded by hispanic-american republics the initial resurgence of interest in cabral had resulted from the rediscovery in 1839 of his resting place by the brazilian historian francisco adolfo de varnhagen later viscount of porto seguro the completely neglected state in which cabrals tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between brazil and portugalthe latter then ruled by pedro iis eldest sister maria ii in 1871 the brazilian emperorthen on a trip to europevisited cabrals gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study which was carried out in 1882 in a second exhumation during 1896 an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed although his remains still lay in portugal the urn was eventually brought to the old cathedral of rio de janeiro in brazil on 30 december 1903 cabral has since become a national hero in brazil in portugal however he has been much overshadowed by his rival vasco da gama historian william greenlee argued that cabrals exploration is important not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period though he acknowledges that few voyages have been of greater importance to posterity he also says that few have been less appreciated in their time nevertheless historian james mcclymont affirmed that cabrals position in the history of portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men he concluded that cabral will always be remembered in history as the chief if not the first discoverer of brazil intentional discovery hypothesis a controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether cabrals discovery was by chance or intentional if the latter that would mean that the portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west the matter was first raised by emperor pedro ii in 1854 during a session of the brazilian historic and geographic institute when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional until the 1854 conference the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident early works on the subject supported this view including histria do descobrimento e conquista da ndia history of the discovery and conquest of india published in 1541 by ferno lopes de castanheda dcadas da sia decades of asia 1552 by joo de barros crnicas do felicssimo rei d manuel chronicles of the most fortunate d manuel 1558 by damio de gis lendas da ndia legends of india 1561 by gaspar correia histria do brasil history of brazil 1627 by friar vicente do salvador and histria da amrica portuguesa history of portuguese america 1730 by sebastio da rocha pita the first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by joaquim noberto de sousa e silva after pedro ii had opened the debate since then several scholars have subscribed to that view including francisco adolfo de varnhagen capistrano de abreu pedro calmon fbio ramos and mrio barata historian hlio vianna affirmed that although there are signs of the intentionality in cabrals discovery based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the south atlantic there are no irrefutable proofs to support it this opinion is also shared by historian thomas skidmore the debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered irrelevant by historian charles r boxer historian anthony smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will probably never be resolved forerunners cabral was not the first european to stumble upon areas of present-day brazil not to mention other parts of south america roman coins have been found in todays venezuela northwest of brazil presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times norsemen reached north america and even established settlements though these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th century christopher columbus on his third voyage to the new world in 1498 traveled along part of what would later become venezuela in the case of brazil it was once considered probable that the portuguese navigator duarte pacheco pereira had made a voyage to the brazilian coast in 1498 this belief has since been dismissed however and it is now thought that he voyaged to north america instead there is more certain evidence that two spaniards vicente yez pinzn and diego de lepe traveled along the northern coast of brazil between january and march 1500 pinzn went from what is today fortaleza capital of the brazilian state of cear to the mouth of the amazon river there he encountered another spanish expedition led by lepe which would reach as far as the oyapock river in march the reason cabral is credited with having discovered brazil rather than the spanish explorers is because the visits by pinzn and lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact historians capistrano de abreu francisco adolfo de varnhagen mrio barata and hlio vianna concur that the spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americaswith a unique history culture and society which sets it apart from the hispanic-american societies which dominate the rest of the continent titles and honors nobility moo fidalgo on 30 june 1484 fidalgo in the kings council in 1497 knight in the kings council around 1518
