island te ika-a-mui and the south island te waipounamuand around 600 smaller islands new zealand is situated some 2000 kilometres 1200mi east of australia across the tasman sea and roughly 1000 kilometres 600mi south of the pacific island areas of new caledonia fiji and tonga because of its remoteness it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans during its long period of isolation new zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal fungal and plant life the countrys varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks such as the southern alps owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions new zealands capital city is wellington while its most populous city is auckland sometime between 1250 and 1300 polynesians settled in the islands that later were named new zealand and developed a distinctive mori culture in 1642 dutch explorer abel tasman became the first european to sight new zealand in 1840 representatives of the united kingdom and mori chiefs signed the treaty of waitangi which declared british sovereignty over the islands in 1841 new zealand became a colony within the british empire and in 1907 it became a dominion it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the british monarch remained the head of state today the majority of new zealands population of 49million is of european descent the indigenous mori are the largest minority followed by asians and pacific islanders reflecting this new zealands culture is mainly derived from mori and early british settlers with recent broadening arising from increased immigration the official languages are english mori and nz sign language with english being very dominant a developed country new zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance such as quality of life health education protection of civil liberties and economic freedom new zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy the service sector dominates the national economy followed by the industrial sector and agriculture international tourism is a significant source of revenue nationally legislative authority is vested in an elected unicameral parliament while executive political power is exercised by the cabinet led by the prime minister who is currently jacinda ardern queen elizabeth ii is the countrys head of state and is represented by a governor-general currently dame patsy reddy in addition new zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes the realm of new zealand also includes tokelau a dependent territory the cook islands and niue self-governing states in free association with new zealand and the ross dependency which is new zealands territorial claim in antarctica new zealand is a member of the united nations commonwealth of nations anzus organisation for economic co-operation and development asean plus six asia-pacific economic cooperation and the pacific islands forum etymology dutch explorer abel tasman sighted new zealand in 1642 and named it staten land in honour of the states general dutch parliament he wrote it is possible that this land joins to the staten land but it is uncertain referring to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america discovered by jacob le maire in 1616 in 1645 dutch cartographers renamed the land nova zeelandia after the dutch province of zeeland british explorer james cook subsequently anglicised the name to new zealand aotearoa pronounced atro often translated as land of the long white cloud is the current mori name for new zealand it is unknown whether mori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of europeans with aotearoa originally referring to just the north island mori had several traditional names for the two main islands including te ika-a-mui the fish of mui for the north island and te waipounamu the waters of greenstone or te waka o aoraki the canoe of aoraki for the south island early european maps labelled the islands north north island middle south island and south stewart island rakiura in 1830 maps began to use north and south to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm the new zealand geographic board discovered in 2009 that the names of the north island and south island had never been formalised and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 this set the names as north island or te ika-a-mui and south island or te waipounamu for each island either its english or mori name can be used or both can be used together history new zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans radiocarbon dating evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial dna variability within mori populations suggest new zealand was first settled by eastern polynesians between 1250 and 1300 concluding a long series of voyages through the southern pacific islands over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as mori the population was divided into iwi tribes and hap subtribes who would sometimes cooperate sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other at some point a group of mori migrated to rkohu now known as the chatham islands where they developed their distinct moriori culture the moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 largely because of taranaki mori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s although european diseases also contributed in 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded moriori died in 1933 the first europeans known to have reached new zealand were dutch explorer abel tasman and his crew in 1642 in a hostile encounter four crew members were killed and at least one mori was hit by canister shot europeans did not revisit new zealand until 1769 when british explorer james cook mapped almost the entire coastline following cook new zealand was visited by numerous european and north american whaling sealing and trading ships they traded european food metal tools weapons and other goods for timber mori food artefacts and water the introduction of the potato and the musket transformed mori agriculture and warfare potatoes provided a reliable food surplus which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns the resulting intertribal musket wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 killing 3000040000 mori from the early 19th century christian missionaries began to settle new zealand eventually converting most of the mori population the mori population declined to around 40 of its pre-contact level during the 19th century introduced diseases were the major factor in 1788 captain arthur phillip assumed the position of governor of the new british colony of new south wales which according to his commission included new zealand the british government appointed james busby as british resident to new zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern mori in 1835 following an announcement of impending french settlement by charles de thierry the nebulous united tribes of new zealand sent a declaration of independence to king william iv of the united kingdom asking for protection ongoing unrest the proposed settlement of new zealand by the new zealand company which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from mori and the dubious legal standing of the declaration of independence prompted the colonial office to send captain william hobson to claim sovereignty for the united kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the mori the treaty of waitangi was first signed in the bay of islands on 6 february 1840 in response to the new zealand companys attempts to establish an independent settlement in wellington and french settlers purchasing land in akaroa hobson declared british sovereignty over all of new zealand on 21 may 1840 even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for mori to sign with the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants particularly from the united kingdom began to increase new zealand still part of the colony of new south wales became a separate colony of new zealand on 1 july 1841 the colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first parliament met in 1854 in 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s following concerns that the south island might form a separate colony premier alfred domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from auckland to a locality near cook strait wellington was chosen for its central location with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865 as immigrant numbers increased conflicts over land led to the new zealand wars of the 1860s and 1870s resulting in the loss and confiscation of much mori land in 1891 the liberal party came to power as the first organised political party the liberal government led by richard seddon for most of its period in office passed many important social and economic measures in 1893 new zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions in 1907 at the request of the new zealand parliament king edward vii proclaimed new zealand a dominion within the british empire reflecting its self-governing status in 1947 the country adopted the statute of westminster confirming that the british parliament could no longer legislate for new zealand without the consent of new zealand early in the 20th century new zealand was involved in world affairs fighting in the first and second world wars and suffering through the great depression the depression led to the election of the first labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy new zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the second world war and mori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work a mori protest movement developed which criticised eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of mori culture and of the treaty of waitangi in 1975 a waitangi tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the treaty and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985 the government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi although mori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s government and politics new zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy although its constitution is not codified elizabeth ii is the queen of new zealand and thus the head of state the queen is represented by the governor-general whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister the governor-general can exercise the crowns prerogative powers such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers ambassadors and other key public officials and in rare situations the reserve powers eg the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law the powers of the queen and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers the new zealand parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the house of representatives it also included an upper house the legislative council until this was abolished in 1950 the supremacy of parliament over the crown and other government institutions was established in england by the bill of rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in new zealand the house of representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats if no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured the governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition cabinet formed by ministers and led by the prime minister is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions members of cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions a parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election almost all general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system since the 1996 election a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional mmp has been used under the mmp system each person has two votes one is for a candidate standing in the voters electorate and the other is for a party since the 2014 election there have been 71 electorates which include seven mori electorates in which only mori can optionally vote and the remaining 49 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5 of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties national and labour between march 2005 and august 2006 new zealand became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in the landhead of state governor-general prime minister speaker and chief justicewere occupied simultaneously by women the current prime minister is jacinda ardern who has been in office since 26 october 2017 she is the countrys third female prime minister new zealands judiciary headed by the chief justice includes the supreme court court of appeal the high court and subordinate courts judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence this theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by parliament without other influences on their decisions new zealand is identified as one of the worlds most stable and well-governed states as at 2017 the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions and first in government transparency and lack of corruption a 2017 human rights report by the us department of state noted that the government generally respected the rights of individuals but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the mori population new zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process with 77 voter turnout during recent elections compared to an oecd average of 69 foreign relations and military early colonial new zealand allowed the british government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy the 1923 and 1926 imperial conferences decided that new zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with japan on 3 september 1939 new zealand allied itself with britain and declared war on germany with prime minister michael joseph savage proclaiming where she goes we go where she stands we stand in 1951 the united kingdom became increasingly focused on its european interests while new zealand joined australia and the united states in the anzus security treaty the influence of the united states on new zealand weakened following protests over the vietnam war the refusal of the united states to admonish france after the sinking of the rainbow warrior disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and new zealands nuclear-free policy despite the united states suspension of anzus obligations the treaty remained in effect between new zealand and australia whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend close political contact is maintained between the two countries with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit live and work in both countries without restrictions in 2013 there were about 650000 new zealand citizens living in australia which is equivalent to 15 of the resident population of new zealand new zealand has a strong presence among the pacific island countries a large proportion of new zealands aid goes to these countries and many pacific people migrate to new zealand for employment permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 samoan quota scheme and the 2002 pacific access category which allow up to 1100 samoan nationals and up to 750 other pacific islanders respectively to become permanent new zealand residents each year a seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8000 pacific islanders were employed under it new zealand is involved in the pacific islands forum asia-pacific economic cooperation and the association of southeast asian nations regional forum including the east asia summit new zealand is a member of the united nations the commonwealth of nations and the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd and participates in the five power defence arrangements new zealands armed forcesthe defence forcecomprise the new zealand army the royal new zealand air force and the royal new zealand navy new zealands national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely however its military has had a global presence the country fought in both world wars with notable campaigns in gallipoli crete el alamein and cassino the gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering new zealands national identity and strengthened the anzac tradition it shares with australia in addition to vietnam and the two world wars new zealand fought in the second boer war the korean war the malayan emergency the gulf war and the afghanistan war it has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions such as those in cyprus somalia bosnia and herzegovina the sinai angola cambodia the iraniraq border bougainville east timor and the solomon islands local government and external territories the early european settlers divided new zealand into provinces which had a degree of autonomy because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways education land sales and other policies government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 the provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries since 1876 various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government in 1989 the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities the 249 municipalities that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils the regional councils role is to regulate the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage water local roads building consents and other local matters five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils the territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils 53 district councils and the chatham islands council while officially the chatham islands council is not a unitary authority it undertakes many functions of a regional council the realm of new zealand one of 16 commonwealth realms is the entire area over which the queen of new zealand is sovereign and comprises new zealand tokelau the ross dependency the cook islands and niue the cook islands and niue are self-governing states in free association with new zealand the new zealand parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence tokelau is classified as a non-self-governing territory but is administered by a council of three elders one from each tokelauan atoll the ross dependency is new zealands territorial claim in antarctica where it operates the scott base research facility new zealand nationality law treats all parts of the realm equally so most people born in new zealand the cook islands niue tokelau and the ross dependency are new zealand citizens environment geography new zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands the two main islands the north island or te ika-a-mui and the south island or te waipounamu are separated by cook strait 22 kilometres 14mi wide at its narrowest point besides the north and south islands the five largest inhabited islands are stewart island across the foveaux strait chatham island great barrier island in the hauraki gulf durville island in the marlborough sounds and waiheke island about 22km 14mi from central auckland new zealand is long and narrow over 1600 kilometres 990mi along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres 250mi with about 15000km 9300mi of coastline and a total land area of 268000 square kilometres 103500sqmi because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline the country has extensive marine resources its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world covering more than 15 times its land area the south island is the largest landmass of new zealand and is the 12th largest island in the world it is divided along its length by the southern alps there are 18 peaks over 3000 metres 9800ft the highest of which is aoraki mount cook at 3754 metres 12316ft fiordlands steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the south island the north island is the 14th largest island in the world and is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism the highly active taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau punctuated by the north islands highest mountain mount ruapehu 2797 metres 9177ft the plateau also hosts the countrys largest lake lake taupo nestled in the caldera of one of the worlds most active supervolcanoes the country owes its varied topography and perhaps even its emergence above the waves to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the pacific and indo-australian plates new zealand is part of zealandia a microcontinent nearly half the size of australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the gondwanan supercontinent about 25 million years ago a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region this is now most evident in the southern alps formed by compression of the crust beside the alpine fault elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other producing the puysegur trench to the south the hikurangi trench east of the north island and the kermadec and tonga trenches further north new zealand is part of australasia and also forms the southwestern extremity of polynesia the term oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the australian continent new zealand and various islands in the pacific ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model landscapes of new zealand rural scene near queenstown rural scene near

subtropical in northland of the seven largest cities christchurch is the driest receiving on average only 640 millimetres 25in of rain per year and wellington the wettest receiving almost twice that amount auckland wellington and christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2000 hours of sunshine the southern and southwestern parts of the south island have a cooler and cloudier climate with around 14001600 hours the northern and northeastern parts of the south island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 24002500 hours the general snow season is early june until

island cities are warmest in january biodiversity new zealands geographic isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the countrys species of animals fungi and plants physical isolation has caused biological isolation resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species about 82 of new zealands indigenous vascular plants are endemic covering 1944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family the number of fungi recorded from new zealand including lichen-forming species is not known nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic but one estimate suggests there are about 2300 species of lichen-forming fungi in new zealand and 40 of these are endemic the two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps or by southern beech in cooler climates the remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands the majority of which are tussock before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 of the land was covered in forest with only high alpine wet infertile and volcanic areas without trees massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived with around half the forest cover lost to fire after polynesian settlement much of the remaining forest fell after european settlement being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming leaving forest occupying only 23 of the land the forests were dominated by birds and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi kakapo weka and takah evolving flightlessness the arrival of humans associated changes to habitat and the introduction of rats ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species including large birds like the moa and haasts eagle other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles tuatara skinks and geckos frogs spiders insects weta and snails some such as the tuatara are so unique that they have been called living fossils three species of bats one since extinct were the only sign of native land mammals in new zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old marine mammals however are abundant with almost half the worlds cetaceans whales dolphins and porpoises and large numbers of fur seals reported in new zealand waters many seabirds breed in new zealand a third of them unique to the country more penguin species are found in new zealand than in any other country since human arrival almost half of the countrys vertebrate species have become extinct including at least fifty-one birds three frogs three lizards one freshwater fish and one bat others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced however new zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover including island sanctuaries pest control wildlife translocation fostering and ecological restoration of islands and other selected areas economy new zealand has an advanced market economy ranked 16th in the 2018 human development index and third in the 2018 index of economic freedom it is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic product gdp per capita of us36254 the currency is the new zealand dollar informally known as the kiwi dollar it also circulates in the cook islands see cook islands dollar niue tokelau and the pitcairn islands historically extractive industries have contributed strongly to new zealands economy focussing at different times on sealing whaling flax gold kauri gum and native timber the first shipment of refrigerated meat on the dunedin in 1882 led to the establishment of meat and dairy exports to britain a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in new zealand high demand for agricultural products from the united kingdom and the united states helped new zealanders achieve higher living standards than both australia and western europe in the 1950s and 1960s in 1973 new zealands export market was reduced when the united kingdom joined the european economic community and other compounding factors such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crises led to a severe economic depression living standards in new zealand fell behind those of australia and western europe and by 1982 new zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the world bank in the mid-1980s new zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period since 1984 successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring known first as rogernomics and then ruthanasia rapidly transforming new zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free-trade economy unemployment peaked above 10 in 1991 and 1992 following the 1987 share market crash but eventually fell to a record low since 1986 of 37 in 2007 ranking third from twenty-seven comparable oecd nations however the global financial crisis that followed had a major impact on new zealand with the gdp shrinking for five consecutive quarters the longest recession in over thirty years and unemployment rising back to 7 in late 2009 unemployment rates for different age groups follow similar trends but are consistently higher among youth in the december 2014 quarter the general unemployment rate was around 58 while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 156 new zealand has experienced a series of brain drains since the 1970s that still continue today nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas mostly in australia and britain which is the largest proportion from any developed nation in recent decades however a brain gain has brought in educated professionals from europe and less developed countries today new zealands economy benefits from a high level of innovation trade new zealand is heavily dependent on international trade particularly in agricultural products exports account for 24 of its output making new zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns food products made up 55 of the value of all the countrys exports in 2014 wood was the second largest earner 7 new zealands main trading partners as at june 2018 are china nz278b australia 262b the european union 229b the united states 176b and japan 84b on 7 april 2008 new zealand and china signed the new zealandchina free trade agreement the first such agreement china has signed with a developed country the service sector is the largest sector in the economy followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction tourism plays a significant role in the economy contributing 129 billion or 56 to new zealands total gdp and supporting 75 of the total workforce in 2016 international visitor arrivals are expected to increase at a rate of 54 annually up to 2022 wool was new zealands major agricultural export during the late 19th century even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers in contrast dairy farming increased with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007 to become new zealands largest export earner in the year to june 2018 dairy products accounted for 177 141 billion of total exports and the countrys largest company fonterra controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade other exports in 2017-18 were meat 88 wood and wood products 62 fruit 36 machinery 22 and wine 21 new zealands wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy the number of vineyards doubling over the same period overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007 infrastructure in 2015 renewable energy primarily geothermal and hydroelectric power generated 401 of new zealands gross energy supply geothermal power alone accounted for 22 of new zealands energy in 2015 the provision of water supply and sanitation is generally of good quality regional authorities provide water abstraction treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed areas new zealands transport network comprises 94000 kilometres 58410mi of roads including 199 kilometres 124mi of motorways and 4128 kilometres 2565mi of railway lines most major cities and towns are linked by bus services although the private car is the predominant mode of transport the railways were privatised in 1993 but were re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008 the state-owned enterprise kiwirail now operates the railways with the exception of commuter services in auckland and wellington which are operated by transdev and metlink respectively railways run the length of the country although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers most international visitors arrive via air and new zealand has six international airports but currently only the auckland and christchurch airports connect directly with countries other than australia or fiji the new zealand post office had a monopoly over telecommunications until 1987 when telecom new zealand was formed initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990 chorus which was split from telecom now spark in 2011 still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure but competition from other providers has increased a large-scale rollout of gigabit-capable fibre to the premises branded as ultra-fast broadband began in 2009 with a target of being available to 87 of the population by 2022 as of 2017 the united nations international telecommunication union ranks new zealand 13th in the development of information and communications infrastructure demography the 2013 new zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4242048 an increase of 53 over the 2006 figure as of february 2019 the total population has risen to an estimated 4942200 new zealand is a predominantly urban country with 730 of the population living in the seventeen main urban areas ie population 30000 or greater and 551 living in the four largest cities of auckland christchurch wellington and hamilton new zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures for instance in 2016 auckland was ranked the worlds third most liveable city and wellington the twelfth by the mercer quality of living survey life expectancy for new zealanders in 2012 was 84 years for females and 802 years for males life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline new zealands fertility rate of 21 is relatively high for a developed country and natural births account for a significant proportion of population growth consequently the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations with 20 of new zealanders being 14 years old or younger by 2050 the median age is projected to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 to 29 in 2008 the leading cause of premature death was cancer at 298 followed by ischaemic heart disease 197 and then cerebrovascular disease 92 as of 2016 total expenditure on health care including private sector spending is 92 of gdp ethnicity and immigration in the 2013 census 740 of new zealand residents identified ethnically as european and 149 as mori other major ethnic groups include asian 118 and pacific peoples 74 two-thirds of whom live in the auckland region the population has become more diverse in recent decades in 1961 the census reported that the population of new zealand was 92 european and 7 mori with asian and pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 while the demonym for a new zealand citizen is new zealander the informal kiwi is commonly used both internationally and by locals the mori loanword pkeh has been used to refer to new zealanders of european descent although others reject this appellation the word pkeh today is increasingly used to refer to all non-polynesian new zealanders the mori were the first people to reach new zealand followed by the early european settlers following colonisation immigrants were predominantly from britain ireland and australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white australia policy there was also significant dutch dalmatian german and italian immigration together with indirect european immigration through australia north america south america and south africa net migration increased after the second world war in the 1970s and 1980s policies were relaxed and immigration from asia was promoted in 200910 an annual target of 4500050000 permanent residence approvals was set by the new zealand immigration servicemore than one new migrant for every 100 new zealand residents just over 25 of new zealands population was born overseas with the majority 52

with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment eventually developing their own distinctive culture social organisation was largely communal with families whnau subtribes hap and tribes iwi ruled by a chief rangatira whose position was subject to the communitys approval the british and irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to new zealand and also influenced mori culture particularly with the introduction of christianity however mori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity and mori kinship roles resemble those of other polynesian peoples more recently american australian asian and other european cultures have exerted influence on new zealand non-mori polynesian cultures are also apparent with pasifika the worlds largest polynesian festival now an annual event in auckland the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged industrious problem solvers modesty was expected and enforced through the tall poppy syndrome where high achievers received harsh criticism at the time new zealand was not known as an intellectual country from the early 20th century until the late 1960s mori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of mori into british new zealanders in the 1960s as tertiary education became more available and cities expanded urban culture began to dominate however rural imagery and themes are common in new zealands art literature and media new zealands national symbols are influenced by natural historical and mori sources the silver fern is an emblem appearing on army insignia and sporting team uniforms certain items of popular culture thought to be unique to new zealand are called kiwiana art as part of the resurgence of mori culture the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and mori artists are increasing in number and influence most mori carvings feature human figures generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking detailed head or a grotesque head surface patterns consisting of spirals ridges notches and fish scales decorate most carvings the pre-eminent mori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses wharenui decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations these buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt changing and adapting to different whims or needs mori decorated the white wood of buildings canoes and cenotaphs using red a mixture of red ochre and shark fat and black made from soot paint and painted pictures of birds reptiles and other designs on cave walls mori tattoos moko consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel since european arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of new zealand portraits of mori were also common with early painters often portraying them as noble savages exotic beauties or friendly natives the countrys isolation delayed the influence of european artistic trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive style of regionalism during the 1960s and 1970s many artists combined traditional mori and western techniques creating unique art forms new zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience with exhibitions in the venice biennale in 2001 and the paradise now exhibition in new york in 2004 mori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black red and white triangles diamonds and other geometric shapes greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side europeans brought english fashion etiquette to new zealand and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions standards have since relaxed and new zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual practical and lacklustre however the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000 doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels with some labels gaining international recognition literature mori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form most early english literature was obtained from britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that new zealand literature started to become widely known although still largely influenced by global trends modernism and events the great depression writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in new zealand during this period

expansion of universities local literature flourished dunedin is a unesco city of literature media and entertainment new zealand music has been influenced by blues jazz country rock and roll and hip hop with many of these genres given a unique new zealand interpretation mori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient southeast asian origins and after centuries of isolation created

brass bands and choral music being popular and musicians began touring new zealand in the 1860s pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century the new zealand recording industry began to
