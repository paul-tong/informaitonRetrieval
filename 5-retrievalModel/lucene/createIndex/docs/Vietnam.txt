the paleolithic age homo erectus fossils dating to around 500000 bc have been found in caves in lng sn and ngh an provinces in northern vietnam the oldest homo sapiens fossils from mainland southeast asia are of middle pleistocene provenance and include isolated tooth fragments from tham om and hang hum teeth attributed to homo sapiens from the late pleistocene have also been found at dong can and from the early holocene at mai da dieu lang gao and lang cuom by about 1000 bc the development of wet-rice cultivation and bronze casting in the ma river and red river floodplains led to the flourishing of the ng sn culture notable for its elaborate bronze ng sn drums at this time the early vietnamese kingdoms of vn lang and u lc appeared and the cultures influence spread to other parts of southeast asia including maritime southeast asia throughout the first millennium bc dynastic vietnam the hng bng dynasty of the hng kings is considered the first vietnamese state known in

zhao tuo defeated an dng vng and consolidated u lc into nanyue however nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the chinese han dynasty in 111 bc after the hannanyue war for the next thousand years what is now northern vietnam remained mostly under chinese rule early independence movements such as those of the trng sisters and lady triu were only temporarily successful though the region gained a longer period of independence as vn xun under the anterior l dynasty between ad 544 and 602 by the early 10th century vietnam had gained autonomy but not sovereignty under the khc family in ad 938 the vietnamese lord ng quyn defeated the forces of the chinese southern han state at bch ng river and achieved full independence for vietnam after a millennium of chinese domination renamed as i vit great viet the nation enjoyed a golden era under the l and trn dynasties during the rule of the trn dynasty i vit repelled three mongol invasions meanwhile buddhism of mahyna tradition flourished and became the state religion following the 14067 mingh war which overthrew the h dynasty vietnamese independence was briefly interrupted by the chinese ming dynasty but was restored by l li the founder of the l dynasty the vietnamese dynasties reached their zenith in the l dynasty of the 15th century especially during the reign of emperor l thnh tng 14601497 between the 11th and 18th centuries vietnam expanded southward in a process known as nam tin southward expansion eventually conquering the kingdom of champa and part of the khmer empire from the 16th century onward civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of vietnam first the chinese-supported mc dynasty challenged the l dynastys power after the mc dynasty was defeated the l dynasty was nominally reinstalled but actual power was divided between the northern trnh lords and the southern nguyn lords who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s during this time the nguyn expanded southern vietnam into the mekong delta annexing the central highlands and the khmer lands in the mekong delta the division of the country ended a century later when the ty sn brothers established a new dynasty however their rule did not last long and they were defeated by the remnants of the nguyn lords led by nguyn nh and aided by the french nguyn nh unified vietnam and established the nguyn dynasty ruling under the name gia long french indochina since the 1500s the portuguese have become acquainted with vietnamese coast where they reportedly erected a stele in chm islands to mark their presence by 1533 the portuguese began to land into the vietnamese delta but were forced to leave due to local turmoil and fighting they also had less interest in the territory than in both kingdoms in china and japan after having successfully settled macau and nagasaki to began the profitable macau-japan trade the portuguese began to be involved in trade with hi an where many portuguese traders and their catholic missionaries set their foot into the vietnamese kingdom the dutch also tried to establish contact with vietnam through the central part of quinam in 1601 but failed to mantain long presence there after several violent encounter with the locals the dutch east india company voc only managed to establish official relations with tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving dejima in japan to establishing trade for silk meanwhile the english first attempt through the east india company eic to establishing contact with hi an in 1613 are failed following a violent incident involving their merchant but the english return to establishing relations with tonkin by 1672 where they were allowed to reside in ph hin from between 16151753 french traders also have engaged in trade in the area around ng trong and actively spreading missionaries following the detention of several missionaries as the vietnamese kingdom feel threatened with the continuous christianisation activities the french navy received approval from their government to intervene in vietnam in 1834 with the aim to free imprisoned catholic missionaries from a kingdom that was perceived as xenophobic against foreign influence vietnams kingdom independence was then gradually eroded by france which was aided by the spanish and large catholic militias in a series of military conquests between 1859 and 1885 in 1862 the southern third of the country became the french colony of cochinchina by 1884 the entire country had come under french rule with the central and northern parts of vietnam separated in the two protectorates of annam and tonkin the three vietnamese entities were formally integrated into the union of french indochina in 1887 the french administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on vietnamese society a western-style system of modern education was developed and catholicism was propagated widely most french settlers in indochina were concentrated in cochinchina particularly in the region of saigon and in hanoi the capital of the colony guerrillas of the royalist cn vng movement massacred around a third of vietnams christian population during the colonial period as part of their rebellion against french rule but were defeated in the 1890s after a decade of resistance by the catholics as a reprisal of their earlier massacres another large-scale rebellion the thi nguyn uprising was also suppressed heavily the french developed a plantation economy to promote the export of tobacco indigo tea and coffee however they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government a nationalist political movement soon emerged with leaders such as phan bi chu phan chu trinh phan nh phng emperor hm nghi and h ch minh fighting or calling for independence this resulted in the 1930 yn bi mutiny by the vietnamese nationalist party vnqd which was suppressed heavily by the french the mutiny caused an irreparable split that resulted in many leading members of the organisation becoming communist converts the french maintained full control over their colonies until world war ii when the war in the pacific led to the japanese invasion of french indochina in 1940 afterwards the japanese empire was allowed to station its troops in vietnam while permitting the pro-vichy french colonial administration to continue japan exploited vietnams natural resources to support its military campaigns culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in march 1945 and the vietnamese famine of 1945 which caused up to two million deaths first indochina war in 1941 the vit minh which is a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology emerged under the vietnamese revolutionary leader h ch minh who sought independence for vietnam from france and the end of the japanese occupation following the military defeat of japan and the fall of its puppet empire of vietnam in august 1945 anarchy rioting and murder were widespread since saigons administrative services collapsed the vit minh occupied hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government which asserted national independence on 2 september earlier in july the allies decide to divide indochina into half at the 16th parallel to allow chiang kai-shek of the republic of china receive japanese surrender in the north while lord louis mountbatten of the british receive the surrender in the south with the allies agreeing that indochina belonged to france however as the french were weakened as a result of german occupation the british-indian forces together with the remaining japanese southern expeditionary army group were used to maintain order and to help france re-establish control through the 19451946 war in vietnam h ch minh at the time chose a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with france by which he asked the french to withdraw their colonial administrators and asked for aid from french professors and engineers to help build a modern independent vietnam these requests including the idea for independence however could not be accepted by the provisional government of the french republic which dispatched the french far east expeditionary corps instead to restore colonial rule causing the vit minh to launch a guerrilla campaign against the french in late 1946 matters also turned worse when the republic of china gradually fell to the communists in the chinese communist revolution the resulting first indochina war lasted until july 1954 the defeat of french and vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of in bin ph allowed h ch minh to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent geneva conference the colonial administration was ended and french indochina was dissolved under the geneva accords of 1954 into three countries vietnam and the kingdoms of cambodia and laos vietnam was further divided into north and south administrative regions at the demilitarised zone approximately along the 17th parallel north pending elections scheduled for july 1956 a 300-day period of free movement was permitted during which almost a million northerners mainly catholics moved south fearing persecution by the communists the partition of vietnam was not intended to be permanent by the geneva accords which stipulated that vietnam would be reunited after elections in 1956 however in 1955 the state of vietnams prime minister ng nh dim toppled bo i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother ng nh nhu and proclaimed himself president of the republic of vietnam at that point the internationally recognised state of vietnam effectively ceased to exist and was replaced by the republic of vietnam in the south and h ch minhs democratic republic of vietnam in the north vietnam war between 1953 and 1956 the north vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms including rent reduction and land reform which resulted in significant political oppression during the land reform testimony from north vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100000 executions because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the red river delta area a lower estimate of 50000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time however declassified documents from the vietnamese and hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time although likely greater than 13500 in the south dim countered north vietnamese subversion including the assassination of over 450 south vietnamese officials in 1956 by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in political re-education centres this was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country if only for a time the north vietnamese government claimed that 2148 individuals were killed in the process by november 1957 the pro-hanoi vit cng began a guerrilla campaign in the late 1950s to overthrow dims government from 1960 the soviet union and north vietnam signed treaties providing for further soviet military support in 1963 buddhist discontent with dims regime erupted into mass demonstrations leading to a violent government crackdown this led to the collapse of dims relationship with the united states and ultimately to the 1963 coup in which dim and nhu were assassinated the dim era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments before the pairing of air marshal nguyn cao k and general nguyn vn thiu took control in mid-1965 thiu gradually outmaneuvered k and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971 under this political instability the communists began to gain ground to support south vietnams struggle against the communist insurgency the united states began increasing its contribution of military advisers using the 1964 gulf of tonkin incident as a pretext for such intervention us forces became involved in ground combat operations in 1965 and at their peak they numbered more than 500000 the us also engaged in a sustained aerial bombing campaign meanwhile china and the soviet union provided north vietnam with significant material aid and 15000 combat advisers communist forces supplying the vit cng carried supplies along the h ch minh trail which passed through the kingdom of laos the communists attacked south vietnamese targets during the 1968 tt offensive although the campaign failed militarily it shocked the american establishment and turned us public opinion against the war during the offensive communist troops massacred over 3000 civilians at hu facing an increasing casualty count rising domestic opposition to the war and growing international condemnation the us began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s this process also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise south vietnam following the paris peace accords of 27 january 1973 all american combat troops were withdrawn by 29 march 1973 in december 1974 north vietnam captured the province of phc long and started a full-scale offensive culminating in the fall of saigon on 30 april 1975 south vietnam was briefly ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under military occupation by north vietnam reunification and reforms on 2 july 1976 north and south vietnam were merged to form the socialist republic of vietnam the war left vietnam devastated with the total death toll standing at between 966000 and 38 million in the aftermath of the war under l duns administration there were no mass executions of south vietnamese who had collaborated with the us and the defunct south vietnamese government confounding western fears however up to 300000 south vietnamese were sent to re-education camps where many endured torture starvation and disease while being forced to perform hard labour the government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories in 1978 as a response towards the khmer rouge who had been invading and massacring vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of an giang and kin giang the vietnamese military invaded cambodia and removed them from power after overtaking phnom penh the intervention was a success resulting in the establishment of a new pro-vietnam socialist government the peoples republic of kampuchea which ruled until 1989 this action however worsened relations with china who had been supporting the khmer rouge where they later launched a brief incursion into northern vietnam in 1979 and causing vietnam to rely even more heavily on soviet economic and military aid with the mistrust towards the chinese government began to escalate at the sixth national congress of the communist party of vietnam cpv in december 1986 reformist politicians replaced the old guard government with new leadership the reformers were led by 71-year-old nguyn vn linh who became the partys new general secretary linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as i mi renovation which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a socialist-oriented market economy though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under i mi the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories economic deregulation and foreign investment while maintaining control over strategic industries the vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production construction exports and foreign investment despite through these reforms also have caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities geography vietnam is located on the eastern indochinese peninsula between the latitudes 8 and 24n and the longitudes 102 and 110e it covers a total area of approximately 331212km 127882sqmi the combined length of the countrys land boundaries is 4639km 2883mi and its coastline is 3444km 2140mi long at its narrowest point in the central qung

covering no more than 20 mountains account for 40 of the countrys land area and tropical forests cover around 42 the red river delta in the north a flat roughly triangular region covering 15000km 5792sqmi is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the mekong river delta in the south once an inlet of the gulf of tonkin it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits the delta covering about 40000km 15444sqmi is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres 98ft above sea level at any point it is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres 1969 to 2625ft into the sea every year southern vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands the mountains of the annamite range and extensive forests comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil the highlands account for 16 of the countrys arable land and 22 of its total forested land the soil in much of southern part of vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation several minor earthquakes have been recorded in the past with most occurred near the northern vietnamese border in the provinces of in bin lo cai and sn la while some are recorded in the offshore of the central part of the country the northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the red river delta fansipan also called as phan xi png which is located in lo cai province is the highest mountain in vietnam standing 3143m 10312ft high from north to south vietnam the country also has numerous islands with ph quc being the largest the hang sn ong cave is considered as the current largest cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009 while both the ba b lake and mekong river being the largest lake and longest river in the country respectively climate due to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief the climate tends to vary considerably for each region during the winter or dry season extending roughly from november to april the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the chinese coast and across the gulf of tonkin picking up considerable moisture the average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains especially in southern vietnam compared to the north temperatures vary less in the southern plains around ho chi minh city and the mekong delta ranging from between 21 and 35c 698 and 950f over the course of the year in hanoi and the surrounding areas of red river delta the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33c 590 and 914f while seasonal variations in the mountains and plateaus and in the northernmost are much more dramatic with temperatures varying from 3c 374f in december and january to 37c 986f in july and august as vietnam received high rain precipitation with an average amount of rainfall from 1500 millimitres to 2000 millimetres during the monsoon seasons this often causes flooding especially in the cities with poor drainage systems the country is also affected by tropical depressions tropical storms and typhoons biodiversity as the country is located inside the indomalayan realm vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity as also been stated in the country national environmental condition report in 2005

tin national park however the last individual of the species in vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010 in agricultural genetic diversity vietnam is one of the worlds twelve original cultivar centres the vietnam national cultivar gene bank preserves 12300 cultivars of 115 species the vietnamese government spent us4907 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas including 30 national parks environment in vietnam poaching had become a main issue for their wildlife since 2000 a non-governmental organisation ngo called education for nature - vietnam have been founded to instill the importance of wildlife conservation in the country following this the seeds of the conservation movement starting to bloom with the foundation of another ngo called greenviet by vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection through collaboration between the ngo and local authorities many local poaching syndicates managed to be crippled with the arrestment of their leaders as vietnam have also become the main destination for rhinoceros horn illegal export from south africa a study in 2018 found the demands are due to medical and health-related reasons the main environmental concern that persists in vietnam until present is the chemical herbicide legacy of agent orange that causing birth defects and many health problems towards vietnamese residents especially in the southern and central areas that was affected most by the chemicals with nearly 48 million vietnamese have been exposed in 2012 approximately 50 years after the war the united states began to start a us43 million joint clean up project in the former chemical storage areas in vietnam that was heavily affected with each clearance will be done through several phases following the completion of the first phase in nng in late 2017 the united states announced its further commitment to clean other sites especially in another heavily impact site of bin ha which is four times larger than the previous site with an additional estimate cost of 390 million the vietnamese government spends over vn10 trillion each year 4311 million for monthly allowance and physical rehabilitation of the vietnamese victims caused by the chemicals in 2018 japanese engineering group shimizu corporation also working with vietnamese military to built a plant in vietnam for the treatment of agent orange polluted soils with the plant construction costs to be funded by the company itself one of the long-term plan to restore the southern vietnam damaged ecosystems is through reforestation efforts which the vietnamese government having done since the end of the war starting with the replantation of mangrove forests in the mekong delta regions and in cn gi outside of the main city where mangroves are important to prevent more serious flooding during the monsoon seasons apart from herbicide problems arsenic exposure to ground water in the mekong delta and red river delta also become a major concern along with unexploded ordnance uxo that poses dangers towards human and habitat life as another bitter legacy from the long wars as part of the continuous campaign for deminingremoval of uxo various international bomb removal agency including those from the united kingdom denmark south korea as well the united states itself has providing help in the process with the vietnam government spends over vn1 trillion 44 million annually on demining operations and another hundreds billions of ng for treatment assistance rehabilitation vocational training and resettlement for the victims of uxos apart from the explosive removal from the legacy of civil war the neighbouring chinese government also has removed 53000 land mines and explosives from the

farms factories and capital goods was carried out as components in establishing central planning with millions of people working in state enterprises despite strict state control vietnams economy continued to be plagued with inefficiency and corruption in state-owned enterprises poor quality and underproduction with the decrease of soviet economic aid as the main trading partners for vietnam following the erosion of the eastern bloc in the late 1980s and subsequent soviet union collapse in addition to the negative impacts from the post-war trade embargo imposed by the united states vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embark on a policy of economic development in 1986 the sixth national congress of the cpv introduced

attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality these policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the i mi program investment in poorer remote areas and subsidising of education and healthcare since the early 2000s vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets manufacturing information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy though vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry it is currently the third-largest oil producer in southeast asia with a total 2011 output of 318000 barrels per day 50600md in 2010 vietnam was ranked as the 8th largest crude petroleum producers in the asia and pacific region the united states was the country that purchased the highest amount of vietnams exports while goods from china were the most popular

exporter of agricultural products it is now the worlds largest producer of cashew nuts with a one-third global share the largest producer of black pepper accounting for one-third of the worlds market and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after thailand since the 1990s subsequently vietnam is also the worlds second largest exporter of coffee the country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other nations in the greater mekong subregion other primary exports include tea rubber and fishery products although agricultures share of vietnams gdp has fallen in recent decades declining from 42 in 1989 to 20 in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen science and technology in 2010 vietnams total state spending on science and technology equalled around 045 of its gdp since the dynastic era vietnamese scholars has developed many academic fields especially in social sciences and humanities vietnam has a millennium-deep

in 2011 between 2005 and 2014 the number of scientific publications recorded in thomson reuters web of science increased at a rate well above the average for southeast asia albeit from a modest starting point publications focus mainly on life sciences 22 physics 13 and engineering 13 which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding almost 77 of all papers published between 2008 and 2014 had at least one international co-author the autonomy which vietnamese research centres have enjoyed since the mid-1990s has enabled many of them to operate as quasi-private organisations providing services such as consulting and technology development some have spun off from the larger institutions to form their own semi-private enterprises fostering the transfer of public sector science and technology personnel to these semi-private establishments one comparatively new university the tn c thng university which built in 1997 has already set up 13 centres for technology transfer and services that together produce 15 of university revenue many of these research centres serve as valuable intermediaries bridging public research institutions universities and firms tourism tourism is an important element of economic activity in the country contributing 75 of the gross domestic product vietnam welcomed over 129 million visitors

private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population road accidents remain the major safety issue in vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people lost their lives daily while traffic congestion is a growing problem in both major cities of hanoi and ho chi minh city especially with the growing of individual car ownership vietnams primary cross-country rail service is the reunification express from ho chi minh city to hanoi with a distance of nearly 1726 kilometres 1072mi from hanoi railway lines branch out to the northeast north and west the eastbound line runs from hanoi to h long bay the northbound line from hanoi to thi nguyn and the northeast line from hanoi to lo cai in 2009 vietnam and japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway by using the technology of japanese shinkansen numerous vietnamese engineers were later sent to japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains the planned railway will be a 1545 kilometres 960mi long express route serving a total of 23 stations including in hanoi and ho chi minh city with 70 of its route will running on bridges and through underground tunnels while the trains will travelling at a maximum speed of 350 kilometres 220mi per hour the plan for the country first high-speed rail however are being postponed with the vietnamese government made a decision to putting the main priority on the development of both hanoi metro and ho chi minh city metro as well the expansion of road networks instead vietnam operates 20 major civil airports including three international gateways noi bai in hanoi da nang international airport in nng and tan son nhat in ho chi minh city tan son nhat is the nations largest airport by which it handling the majority of international passenger traffic according to a state-approved plan vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2015 these include vinh international airport phu bai international airport

country vietnam has many major sea ports including cam ranh nng hi phng ho chi minh city h long qui nhn vng tu ca l and nha trang further inland the countrys extensive network of rivers play a key role in rural transportation with over 47130 kilometres 29290mi of navigable waterways carrying ferries barges and water taxis energy vietnams energy sector is largely dominated by electricity of vietnam evn nationwide as of 2017 evn contributed about 614 of the country power generation system with a total power capacity of 25884 mw other energy source are distributed by petrovietnam 4435 mw vinacomin 1785 mw and by buildoperatetransfer bot with other investors 10031 mw most of the powers are generated from either hydropower fossil fuel power such as coal oil and gas while the remaining are from diesel small hydropower and renewable energy the vietnamese government also previously planning to develop their first nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source of electric energy from nuclear power but the plan was abandoned in late 2016 with a majority oppose vote through the country national assembly due to large concerns from vietnamese society over radioactive contamination the household gas sector in vietnam is dominated by petrovietnam which controls nearly 70 of the country domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas lpg since 2011 the company also operating five renewable energy power plants including the nhn trch 2 thermal power plant 750 mw ph qu wind power plant 6 mw ha na hydro-power plant 180 mw dakdrinh hydro-power plant 125 mw and vng ng

of the country in 2015 were approximately 44 billion barrels and ranked first place in southeast asia while the proven gas reserves were about 06 trillion cubic metres tcm and ranked the third place in southeast asia after indonesia and malaysia water supply and sanitation vietnam has 2360 rivers with average annual discharge of 310 billion m by which raining season accounts for 70 of the whole year discharge most urban water supply systems in the country have been developed without proper management since the past 10 years based on a 2008 survey by vietnam water supply and sewerage association vwsa the existing water production capacity even exceeded the demand but the service coverage is still very low since most of clean water supply infrastructures are not much developed where it only been delivered to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply there is also concern on the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems since domestic and industrial factories releasing their wastewater directly into the water sources without treatment where the government does not take more urgent measures to address the problem with the majority of domestic wastewater is discharged back to the environment and polluting the surface water in recent years there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to developing access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration system with the growing concern from local population about the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well the high levels of arsenic in their groundwater sources the government of netherlands also have been providing aid by focusing its entirety investments in the country mainly on water-related sectors including in water treatment projects regarding sanitation 78 of the population in vietnam had access to improved sanitation or 94 of the urban population and 70 of the rural population despite there are still about 21 million people in the country lacked accessed to improved sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015 in 2018 the construction ministry said that the country water supply and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology it but facing problems such as limited funding climate change and pollution the health ministry also have announced that water inspection units will be established in the country nationwide from june 2019 with inspections to be conducted without notice since there have been many cases involving health caused by poor and polluted water supply as well hygiene conditions are reported every year health by 2015 97 of the population had access to improved water sources in 2016 vietnams national life expectancy stood at 809 years for women and 715 for men and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1000 live births despite these improvements malnutrition is still common in the rural provinces since the partition north vietnam has established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level after the national reunification in 1975 a nationwide health service was established in the late 1980s the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses midwives and hospital beds in 2000 vietnam had only 247 hospital beds per 10000 people before declining to 237 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of vietnamese health ministry the controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the us military during the war has left tangible long-term impacts upon the vietnamese people that still persists in the country until present for instance it led to 3 million vietnamese people suffering health problems one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24 of the area of vietnam being defoliated since the early 2000s vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria with the malaria mortality rate falling to about 5 of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment tuberculosis tb cases however are on the rise which become the second most infectious diseases in the country after respiratory-related illness with an intensified vaccination program better hygiene and foreign assistance vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of tb cases and annual new tb infections in 2004 government subsidies covering about 15 of health care expenses along the same year the united states announced that vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of its global aids relief plan by the following year vietnam had diagnosed 101291 human immunodeficiency virus hiv cases of which 16528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids with 9554 have died the actual number of hiv-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher as on average as between 4050 new infections are reported daily in the country in 2007 04 of the population is estimated to be infected with hiv and the figure has remained stable since 2005 more global aid are being delivered through the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria to fight the spread of the diseases in the country in september 2018 the hanoi peoples committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause other diseases like rabies and leptospirosis as more than 1000 stores in the capital city of hanoi are found to be selling both meats the decision received positive comments among vietnamese society on social media despite many still disagreed as it has been a habit that couldnt be resisted education vietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools colleges and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions general education in vietnam is divided into five categories kindergarten elementary schools middle schools high schools and universities a large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate which stood at 90 in 2008 most universities are located in major cities of hanoi and ho chi minh city with the country education system continuously undergoing a series of reform by the government basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fee for their children without some form of public or private assistance regardless school enrolment is among the highest in the world and the number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005 in higher education the government provide subsidised loans for students through national bank although there are deep concerns about its access as well the burdens among students in repaying since 1995 enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 22 million with 84000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education a number of foreign universities operate private campuses in vietnam including harvard university usa and the royal melbourne institute of technology australia the governments strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics in 2018 a decree on university autonomy to operate independently without a ministry control above their heads are in its final stages of approval with the government will continue to investing in education especially for the poor to have access on basic education demographics as of 2016 the population of vietnam standing at approximately 946 million people the population had grown significantly from the 1979 census which showed the total population of reunified vietnam to be 527 million in 2012 the countrys population was estimated at approximately 903 million based on the 2009 census 704 of the vietnamese population are living in rural areas while only 296 living in urban areas although the average growth rate of the urban population have recently increasing which mainly attributed to migration and rapid urbanisation the dominant viet or kinh ethnic group constituted nearly 736 million people or 858 of the population with most of their population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial deltas and coastal plains of the country as a majority ethnic group the kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country despite this vietnam is also home to other 54 ethnic minority groups including the hmong dao ty thai and nng many ethnic minorities such as the muong who are closely related to the kinh dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of vietnams territory other uplanders in the north migrated from southern china between 1300s and 1800s since the partition of vietnam the population of the central highlands was almost exclusively degar including over 40 tribal groups however the south vietnamese government at the time enacted a program of resettling kinh in indigenous areas the hoa ethnic chinese and khmer krom people are mainly lowlanders throughout vietnam history many chinese people mainly from south china migrated to the country as administrators merchants and even refugees since the reunification in 1976 with the increase of communist policies nationwide that resulting the nationalisation of property and subsequently causing many rich people property in the city especially among the hoa in the south are being confiscated by the government this has led many of them to leave vietnam furthermore with the deteriorating sino-vietnamese relations as a result of border invasion by chinese government in 1979 which added by doubtful among vietnamese society on the chinese government intention had indirectly causing more hoa people in the north to leave the country urbanisation the number of people live in urbanised area in 2017 is estimated to be around 32753 million of people with urbanisation rate at 357 since 1986 vietnams urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the vietnamese government implemented the i mi economic program changing the system into socialist and liberalising property rights as a result hanoi and ho chi minh city the two major cities in the red river delta and southeast regions respectively increased their share of the total urban population from 85 and 249 to 159 and 31 respectively the vietnamese government through its construction ministry forecasts that the country will have a 45 urbanisation rates by 2020 with urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth as any country with higher urbanisation rates would have a higher growth rate of gdp furthermore the urbanisation movements in vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country southeast region ho chi minh city has received a large population of in-migrants mainly due to better weather and economic opportunities a study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standards of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas which also leads to changing in economic structures in 1985 agriculture took up 372 of vietnams gdp nevertheless in 2008 that number went down to 185 a decreasing of 187 in 1985 industry took only a small fraction of vietnam gdp around 262 but in 2008 that number has increased up to 432 urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase peoples standards of living access to electricity has increased tremendously from 14 of total householdshaving electricity in 1993 to above 96 in 2009 in terms of accessing to fresh water data from 65 utility companies show that only 12 of households in the area covered by the companies had access to the water network in 2002 by 2007 more than 70 of the population in the area was connected though urbanisation has many benefits it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic air and water pollution since vietnam has a big consumption of mopeds in their transportation due to the relatively cheap and easy to commute large numbers of mopeds have been known for causing traffic and air pollution in vietnam in the capital city alone the consumption of mopeds has increased from 05 million in 2001 to 47 million in 2013 with the rapid development factories have sprung up rapidly which indirectly polluting air and water as been exampled from the 2016 vietnam marine life disaster caused by the formosa ha tinh steel company which killing many fish and marine habitats in vietnamese waters and directly causing major losses to the country economy there are some governments interventions and solutions trying to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation and having more regulations for factories to handle their wastes although the authorities also have a time schedules for collecting different types of waste waste disposal have become another problem of urbanisation since the amount of solid waste generated in urban areas has increased unimaginably by more than 200 from 2003 to 2008 industrial solid waste alone took up 181 of that 200 one of the governments efforts is trying to promote campaigns to encourage the locals to sort household waste since waste sorting are still not been practised entirely by most vietnamese society religion religion in vietnam 2014 under article 70 of the 1992 constitution of vietnam all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion which means that they can follow any religion or be irreligious and that all religions are equal before the law and that each place of worship is protected under vietnamese state law but religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies according to a survey in 2007 81 of the vietnamese people do not believe in a god based on new government findings in 2009 the number of religious people has increased by 932000 through the latest official statistics presented by the vietnamese government to the united nations special rapporteur in 2014 the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24 million from the total population of almost 90 million formally recognised religious communities include 11 million buddhists 62 million catholics 14 million protestants 44 million caodaisms followers 13 million hoahaoism buddhists as well as 75000 muslims 7000 bahas and 1500 hindus mahyna is the dominant branch of buddhism among the kinh majority who follows religion while theravda are practised in almost entirely by the khmer minority about 7 of the population are christians totalling around six million roman catholics and one million protestants catholicism have been introduced to vietnam by nearby portuguese missionaries jesuits from portuguese macau and malacca towards annam and from remnants of the persecuted japanese catholic between the 16th and 17th centuries before being massively propagated by french missionaries aided by spanish missionaries dominicans from neighbouring spanish east indies towards tonkin in the 19th and 20th centuries a significant number of vietnamese people are also adherents of caodaism an indigenous folk religion which has structured itself on the model of the catholic church together with another buddhist section of hoahaoism protestantism was only recently spread by american and canadian missionaries throughout the modern civil war where it was largely accepted among the highland montagnards of south vietnam the largest protestant churches are the southern evangelical church of vietnam secv and the evangelical church of vietnam north ecvn with around 770000 of the country protestants come from members of ethnic minorities although it is one of the country minority religion and has a shorter history than catholicism protestantism are found to be the countrys fastest-growing religion expanding at a rate of 600 in recent decades several other minority faiths exist in vietnam these includes bani sunni and non-denominational section of islam which is primarily practised among the ethnic cham minority though there were also a few kinh adherents of islam along with other minority adherents of bahais as well hindus among the chams languages the official national language of the country is vietnamese ting vit a tonal austroasiatic languages monkhmer which is spoken by the majority of the population in its early history vietnamese writing used chinese characters before a different meaning set of chinese characters known as ch nm developed between the 7th13th century the folk epic truyn kiu the tale of kieu originally known as on trng tn thanh by nguyn du was written in ch nm quc ng as the romanised vietnamese alphabet used for spoken vietnamese was developed in the 17th century by the jesuit alexandre de rhodes and several other catholic missionaries by using the alphabets of romance languages particularly the portuguese alphabet which later became widely used through vietnamese institutions during the french colonial period vietnams minority groups speak a variety of languages including ty mng cham khmer chinese nng and hmong the montagnard peoples of the central highlands also speak a number of distinct languages as their language is derived from both the austroasiatic and malayo-polynesian language groups in recent years a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities the french language a legacy of colonial rule is spoken by many educated vietnamese as a second language especially among the older generation and those educated in the former south vietnam where it was a principal language in administration education and commerce vietnam remains a full member of the international organisation of the francophonie la francophonie and education has revived some interest in the language russian and to a much lesser extent german czech and polish are known among some northern vietnamese whose families had ties with the eastern bloc during the cold war with improved relations with western countries and recent reforms in vietnamese administration english has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of english is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of french the popularity of japanese and korean have also grown as the countrys ties with other east asian nations have strengthened culture vietnams culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient ng sn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base some elements of the national culture have chinese origins drawing on elements of confucianism mahyna buddhism and taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy vietnamese society is structured around lng ancestral villages all vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month the influence of chinese culture such as the cantonese hakka hokkien and hainanese cultures are more evidenced in the north with the national religion of buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture despite this there is also a chinatown in the south such as in ch ln where many of the chinese have intermarried with kinh and are presently indistinguishable among them in the central and southern part traces of champa and khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient sa hunh culture in recent centuries the influence of western cultures have become popular among newer vietnamese generations the traditional focuses of vietnamese culture are based on humanity nhn ngha and harmony ha in which family and community values are highly regarded vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols such as the vietnamese dragon which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery vietnams national father lc long qun is depicted as a holy dragon the lc is a holy bird representing vietnamese national mother of u c is another prominent symbol while turtle buffalo and horse images are also revered many vietnamese also believes in supernatural and spiritualism where illness could be brought on by a curse or sorcery or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic where it needs to be treated through traditional medical practitioners amulets and other forms of spiritual protection where religious practices may be employed to treating the ill person in the modern era the cultural life of vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs for many decades foreign cultural influences especially those of western origin were shunned but since the recent reformation vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring southeast asian east asian as well to western culture and media the main vietnamese formal dress the o di is worn for special occasions such as in weddings and

bolero music has gained its position in the country since 1930s albeit with a different style from a combination between traditional vietnamese music with western elements however the modern
