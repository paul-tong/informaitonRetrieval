marcus aurelius rilis or riljs latin marcus aurelius antoninus augustus 26 april 121 17 march 180 called the philosopher was roman emperor from 161 to 180 he ruled the roman empire with his adoptive brother lucius verus who took verus as a regnal name until lucius death in 169 he was the last of the rulers traditionally known as the five good emperors he is also seen as the last emperor of the pax romana an age of relative peace and stability for the empire his personal philosophical writings now commonly known as meditations are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient stoic philosophy they have been praised by fellow writers philosophers and monarchs as well as by poets and politicians centuries after his death marcus was born into a roman patrician family his father was a praetor after whose death in 124 marcus was raised by his paternal grandfather and his mother was a wealthy heiress he was educated at home as children from roman aristocratic families often were and later credited his maternal grandmothers step-father lucius catilius severus who helped marcus grandfather to raise him for his education his tutors included the artist diognetus who may have sparked his interest in philosophy and tuticius proclus marcus was betrothed to the daughter of lucius aelius his relative emperor hadrians first adopted son and heir aelius died in 138 and hadrian chose as his new heir antoninus pius the husband of marcus aunt on the condition that antoninus adopt marcus and the son of aelius lucius commodus antoninus became emperor later that year and marcus and lucius became joint heirs to the throne while imperial heir marcus studied greek and latin his tutors included herodes atticus and marcus cornelius fronto he kept in close correspondence with fronto for many years afterwards marcus was introduced to stoicism by quintus junius rusticus and perhaps by other philosophers such as apollonius of chalcedon he was made a quaestor and the symbolic head of the roman equites also known as the knight class he was appointed consul with antoninus in 140 and 145 the year he married antoninus daughter faustina the younger and with his adoptive brother lucius in 161 on 7 march 161 antoninus died and the two succeeded to the imperial throne marcus reign was marked by military conflict in the east the roman empire fought successfully with a revitalized parthian empire and the rebel kingdom of armenia marcus defeated the marcomanni quadi and sarmatians in the marcomannic wars however these and other germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the empire marcus modified the silver purity of the roman currency the denarius persecution of christians is believed to have increased during his reign the antonine plague that broke out in 166 devastated the population of the roman empire it caused the deaths of five million people a quarter of those it affected marcus never adopted an heir unlike some of his predecessors he and faustina had at least thirteen children including lucilla who married lucius verus and commodus whom marcus named as his co-ruler in 177 marcus became the first emperor to die with a living adult son since titus succeeded his father vespasian a century earlier but commodus is considered a disappointment as emperor and his succession has long been the subject of debate among both contemporary and modern historians the column and equestrian statue of marcus aurelius still stand in rome where they were erected in celebration of marcus military victories sources the major sources depicting the life and rule of marcus are patchy and frequently unreliable the most important group of sources the biographies contained in the historia augusta claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century ad but were in fact written by a single author referred to here as the biographer from about 395 ad the later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are unreliable but the earlier biographies derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources marius maximus or ignotus are much more accurate for marcus life and rule the biographies of hadrian antoninus marcus and lucius are largely reliable but those of aelius verus and avidius cassius are not a body of correspondence between marcus tutor fronto and various antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts covering the period from c 138 to 166 marcus own meditations offer a window on his inner life but are largely undateable and make few specific references to worldly affairs the main narrative source for the period is cassius dio a greek senator from bithynian nicaea who wrote a history of rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books dio is vital for the military history of the period but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective some other literary sources provide specific details the writings of the physician galen on the habits of the antonine elite the orations of aelius aristides on the temper of the times and the constitutions preserved in the digest and codex justinianus on marcus legal work inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources early life and career name marcus was born in rome on 26 april 121 his name at birth was supposedly marcus annius verus but some sources assign this name to him upon his fathers death and unofficial adoption by his grandfather upon his coming of age or at the time of his marriage he may have been known as marcus annius catilius severus at birth or at some point in his youth or marcus catilius severus annius verus upon his adoption by antoninus as heir to the throne he was known as marcus aelius aurelius verus caesar and upon his ascension he was marcus aurelius antoninus augustus until his death epiphanius of salamis in his chronology of the roman emperors on weights and measures calls him marcus aurelius verus family origins marcus family originated in ucubi a small town southeast of crdoba in iberian baetica the family rose to prominence in the late 1st century ad marcus great-grandfather marcus annius verus i was a senator and according to the historia augusta ex-praetor his grandfather marcus annius verus ii was made a patrician in 7374 through his grandmother rupilia marcus was a member of the nerva-antonine dynasty salonia matidia the emperor trajans niece through his sister was the mother of rupilia and her half-sister hadrians wife sabina verus and rupilias elder son marcus father marcus annius verus iii married domitia lucilla she was the daughter of the patrician p calvisius tullus ruso and domitia lucilla who had inherited a great fortune described at length in one of plinys letters from her maternal grandfather and her paternal grandfather by adoption the younger lucilla would acquire much of her mothers wealth including a large brickworks on the outskirts of rome a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom childhood marcus sister annia cornificia faustina was probably born in 122 or 123 his father probably died in 124 during his praetorship when marcus was three years old though he can hardly have known his father marcus wrote in his meditations that he had learned modesty and manliness from his memories of his father and from the mans posthumous reputation his mother lucilla did not remarry and following prevailing aristocratic customs probably did not spend much time with her son instead marcus was in the care of nurses even so he credits his mother with teaching him religious piety simplicity in diet and how to avoid the ways of the rich in his letters he makes frequent and affectionate reference to her he was grateful that although she was fated to die young yet she spent her last years with me after his fathers death marcus was raised by his grandfather marcus annius verus ii who had always retained the legal authority of patria potestas over his son and grandson technically this was not an adoption the creation of a new and different patria potestas lucius catilius severus described as marcus maternal great-grandfather also participated in his upbringing he was probably the elder domitia lucillas stepfather marcus was raised in his parents home on the caelian hill which he would affectionately refer to as my caelian it was an upscale area with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas marcus grandfather owned a palace beside the lateran where he would spend much of his childhood marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him good character and avoidance of bad temper he was less fond of the mistress his grandfather took and lived with after the death of his wife rupilia marcus was grateful that he did not have to live with her longer than he did marcus was educated at home in line with contemporary aristocratic trends he thanks catilius severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools one of his teachers diognetus a painting master proved particularly influential he seems to have introduced marcus aurelius to the philosophic way of life in april 132 at the behest of diognetus marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher he studied while wearing a rough greek cloak and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed a new set of tutors alexander of cotiaeum trosius aper and tuticius proculus took over marcus education in about 132 or 133 little is known of the latter two both teachers of latin but alexander was a major littrateur the leading homeric scholar of his day marcus thanks alexander for his training in literary styling alexanders influence an emphasis on matter over style and careful wording with the occasional homeric quotation has been detected in marcus aurelius meditations succession to hadrian in late 136 hadrian almost died from a hemorrhage convalescent in his villa at tivoli he selected lucius ceionius commodus marcus intended father-in-law as his successor and adopted son invitis omnibus against the wishes of everyone while his motives are not certain it would appear that his goal was to eventually place the then-too-young marcus on the throne as part of his adoption commodus took the name lucius aelius caesar his health was so poor that during a ceremony to mark his becoming heir to the throne he was too weak to lift a large shield on his own after a brief stationing on the danube frontier aelius returned to rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138 the night before the speech however he grew ill and died of a hemorrhage later in the day on 24 january 138 hadrian selected aurelius antoninus the husband of marcus aunt faustina the elder as his new successor as part of hadrians terms antoninus in turn adopted marcus and lucius commodus the son of lucius aelius marcus became m aelius aurelius verus and lucius became l aelius aurelius commodus at hadrians request antoninus daughter faustina was betrothed to lucius marcus reportedly greeted the news that hadrian had become his adoptive grandfather with sadness instead of joy only with reluctance did he move from his mothers house on the caelian to hadrians private home at some time in 138 hadrian requested in the senate that marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming quaestor before his twenty-fourth birthday the senate complied and marcus served under antoninus the consul for 139 marcus adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class if not for his adoption he probably would have become triumvir monetalis a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint after that he could have served as tribune with a legion becoming the legions nominal second-in-command marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead as it was marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens nonetheless his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected he still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household after a series of suicide attempts all thwarted by antoninus hadrian left for baiae a seaside resort on the campanian coast his condition did not improve and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors indulging himself in food and drink he sent for antoninus who was at his side when he died on 10 july 138 his remains were buried quietly at puteoli the succession to antoninus was peaceful and stable antoninus kept hadrians nominees in office and appeased the senate respecting its privileges and commuting the death sentences of men charged in hadrians last days for his dutiful behaviour antoninus was asked to accept the name pius heir to antoninus pius 138145 immediately after hadrians death antoninus approached marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended marcus betrothal to ceionia fabia would be annulled and he would be betrothed to faustina antoninus daughter instead faustinas betrothal to ceionias brother lucius commodus would also have to be annulled marcus consented to antoninus proposal antoninus bolstered marcus dignity marcus was made consul for 140 with antoninus as his colleague and was appointed as a seviri one of the knights six commanders at the orders annual parade on 15 july 139 as the heir apparent marcus became princeps iuventutis head of the equestrian order he now took the name caesar marcus aelius aurelius verus caesar marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously see that you do not turn into a caesar do not be dipped into the purple dyefor that can happen at the senates request marcus joined all the priestly colleges pontifices augures quindecimviri sacris faciundis septemviri epulonum etc direct evidence for membership however is available only for the arval brethren antoninus demanded that marcus take up residence in the house of tiberius the imperial palace on the palatine antoninus also made him take up the habits of his new station the aulicum fastigium or pomp of the court against marcus objections marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings he told himself it was an attainable goalwhere life is possible then it is possible to live the right life life is possible in a palace so it is possible to live the right life in a palacebut he found it difficult nonetheless he would criticize himself in the meditations for abusing court life in front of company as quaestor marcus would have had little real administrative work to do he would read imperial letters to the senate when antoninus was absent and would do secretarial work for the senators his duties as consul were more significant one of two senior representatives of the senate he would preside over meetings and take a major role in the bodys administrative functions he felt drowned in paperwork and complained to his tutor marcus cornelius fronto i am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters he was being fitted for ruling the state in the words of his biographer he was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well making oratorical training essential for the job on 1 january 145 marcus was made consul a second time he might have been unwell at this time a letter from fronto that might have been sent at this time urges marcus to have plenty of sleep so that you may come into the senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter as far as my strength is concerned i am beginning to get it back and there is no trace of the pain in my chest but that ulcer i am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it marcus was never particularly healthy or strong cassius dio writing of his later years praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses in april 145 marcus married faustina as had been planned since 138 since marcus was by adoption antoninus son under roman law he was marrying his sister antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority his patria potestas for the ceremony to take place little is specifically known of the ceremony but it is said to have been noteworthy coins were issued with the heads of the couple and antoninus as pontifex maximus would have officiated marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters and only sparing references to faustina fronto and further education after taking the toga virilis in 136 marcus probably began his training in oratory he had three tutors in greek aninus macer caninius celer and herodes atticus and one in latin fronto the latter two were the most esteemed orators of the day but probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by antoninus in 138 the preponderance of greek tutors indicates the importance of the greek language to the aristocracy of rome this was the age of the second sophistic a renaissance in greek letters although educated in rome in his meditations marcus would write his inmost thoughts in greek atticus was controversial an enormously rich athenian probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire he was quick to anger and resented by his fellow athenians for his patronizing manner atticus was an inveterate opponent of stoicism and philosophic pretensions he thought the stoics desire for a lack of feeling foolish they would live a sluggish enervated life he said marcus would become a stoic he would not mention herodes at all in his meditations in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades fronto was highly esteemed in the self-consciously antiquarian world of latin letters he was thought of as second only to cicero perhaps even an alternative to him he did not care much for atticus though marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms fronto exercised a complete mastery of latin capable of tracing expressions through the literature producing obscure synonyms and challenging minor improprieties in word choice a significant amount of the correspondence between fronto and marcus has survived the pair were very close farewell my fronto wherever you are my most sweet love and delight how is it between you and me i love you and you are not here marcus spent time with frontos wife and daughter both named cratia and they enjoyed light conversation he wrote fronto a letter on his birthday claiming to love him as he loved himself and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature he would learn from the lips of fronto his prayers for frontos health were more than conventional because fronto was frequently ill at times he seems to be an almost constant invalid always suffering about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the mans sicknesses marcus asks that frontos pain be inflicted on himself of my own accord with every kind of discomfort fronto never became marcus full-time teacher and continued his career as an advocate one notorious case brought him into conflict with atticus marcus pleaded with fronto first with advice then as a favour not to attack atticus he had already asked atticus to refrain from making the first blows fronto replied that he was surprised to discover marcus counted atticus as a friend perhaps atticus was not yet marcus tutor and allowed that marcus might be correct but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing i will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile if i happen to call him an uneducated little greek it will not mean war to the death the outcome of the trial is unknown by the age of twenty-five between april 146 and april 147 marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in jurisprudence and showed some signs of general malaise his master he writes to fronto was an unpleasant blowhard and had made a hit at him it is easy to sit yawning next to a judge he says but to be a judge is noble work marcus had grown tired of his exercises of taking positions in imaginary debates when he criticized the insincerity of conventional language fronto took to defend it in any case marcus formal education was now over he had kept his teachers on good terms following them devotedly it affected his health adversely his biographer writes to have devoted so much effort to his studies it was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in marcus entire boyhood fronto had warned marcus against the study of philosophy early on it is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophythan to have tasted it superficially with the edge of the lips as the saying is he disdained philosophy and philosophers and looked down on marcus sessions with apollonius of chalcedon and others in this circle fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of marcus conversion to philosophy in the fashion of the young tired of boring work marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training marcus kept in close touch with fronto but would ignore frontos scruples apollonius may have introduced marcus to stoic philosophy but quintus junius rusticus would have the strongest influence on the boy he was the man fronto recognized as having wooed marcus away from oratory he was older than fronto and twenty years older than marcus as the grandson of arulenus rusticus one of the martyrs to the tyranny of domitian r 8196 he was heir to the tradition of stoic opposition to the bad emperors of the 1st century the true successor of seneca as opposed to fronto the false one marcus thanks rusticus for teaching him not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric for writing on speculative themes for discoursing on moralizing texts to avoid oratory poetry and fine writing births and deaths on november 30 147 faustina gave birth to a girl named domitia faustina she was the first of at least thirteen children including two sets of twins that faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years the next day 1 december antoninus gave marcus the tribunician power and the imperium authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor as tribune he had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four antoninus could introduce his tribunican powers would be renewed with antoninus on 10 december 147 the first mention of domitia in marcus letters reveals her as a sickly infant caesar to fronto if the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery the diarrhea has stopped the little attacks of fever have been driven away but the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing he and faustina marcus wrote had been pretty occupied with the girls care domitia would die in 151 in 149 faustina gave birth again to twin sons contemporary coinage commemorates the event with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys and the legend temporum felicitas the happiness of the times they did not survive long before the end of the year another family coin was issued it shows only a tiny girl domitia faustina and one boy baby then another the girl alone the infants were buried in the mausoleum of hadrian where their epitaphs survive they were called titus aurelius antoninus and tiberius aelius aurelius marcus steadied himself one man prays how i may not lose my little child but you must pray how i may not be afraid to lose him he quoted from the iliad what he called the briefest and most familiar sayingenough to dispel sorrow and fear leaves the wind scatters some on the face of the ground like unto them are the children of men another daughter was born on 7 march 150 annia aurelia galeria lucilla at some time between 155 and 161 probably soon after 155 marcus mother domitia lucilla died faustina probably had another daughter in 151 but the child annia galeria aurelia faustina might not have been born until 153 another son tiberius aelius antoninus was born in 152 a coin issue celebrates fecunditati augustae the augustas fertility depicting two girls and an infant the boy did not survive long on coins from 156 only the two girls were depicted he might have died in 152 the same year as marcus sister cornificia by 28 march 158 when marcus replied another of his children was dead marcus thanked the temple synod even though this turned out otherwise the childs name is unknown in 159 and 160 faustina gave birth to daughters fadilla and cornificia named respectively after faustinas and marcus dead sisters antoninus pius last years lucius started his political career as a quaestor in 153 he was consul in 154 and was consul again with marcus in 161 lucius had no other titles except that of son of augustus lucius had a markedly different personality from marcus he enjoyed sports of all kinds but especially hunting and wrestling he took obvious pleasure in the circus games and gladiatorial fights he did not marry until 164 in 156 antoninus turned 70 he found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays he started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions as antoninus aged marcus would take on more administrative duties more still when he became the praetorian prefect an office that was as much secretarial as military as gavius maximus died in 156 or 157 in 160 marcus and lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year antoninus may have already been ill two days before his death the biographer reports antoninus was at his ancestral estate at lorium in etruria about 19 kilometres 12mi from rome he ate alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily in the night he vomited he had a fever the next day the day after that 7 march 161 he summoned the imperial council and passed the state and his daughter to marcus the emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the passwordaequanimitas equanimity he then turned over as if going to sleep and died his death closed out the longest reign since augustus surpassing tiberius by a couple of months emperor accession of marcus aurelius and lucius verus 161 after antoninus died in 161 marcus was effectively sole ruler of the empire the formalities of the position would follow the senate would soon grant him the name augustus and the title imperator and he would soon be formally elected as pontifex maximus chief priest of the official cults marcus made some show of resistance the biographer writes that he was compelled to take imperial power this may have been a genuine horror imperii fear of imperial power marcus with his preference for the philosophic life found the imperial office unappealing his training as a stoic however had made the choice clear that it was his duty although marcus showed no personal affection for hadrian significantly he does not thank him in the first book of his meditations he presumably believed it his duty to enact the mans succession plans thus although the senate planned to confirm marcus alone he refused to take office unless lucius received equal powers the senate accepted granting lucius the imperium the tribunician power and the name augustus marcus became in official titulature imperator caesar marcus aurelius antoninus augustus lucius forgoing his name commodus and taking marcus family name verus became imperator caesar lucius aurelius verus augustus it was the first time that rome was ruled by two emperors in spite of their nominal equality marcus held more auctoritas or authority than lucius he had been consul once more than lucius he had shared in antoninus rule and he alone was pontifex maximus it would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior as the biographer wrote verus obeyed marcusas a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor immediately after their senate confirmation the emperors proceeded to the castra praetoria the camp of the praetorian guard lucius addressed the assembled troops which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores then like every new emperor since claudius lucius promised the troops a special donative this donative however was twice the size of those past 20000 sesterces 5000 denarii per capita with more to officers in return for this bounty equivalent to several years pay the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors the ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary given that marcus accession had been peaceful and unopposed but it was good insurance against later military troubles upon his accession he also devalued the roman currency he decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 835 to 79 the silver weight dropping from 268 grams to 257 grams antoninus funeral ceremonies were in the words of the biographer elaborate if his funeral followed those of his predecessors his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the campus martius and his spirit would have been seen as ascending to the gods home in the heavens marcus and lucius nominated their father for deification in contrast to their behaviour during antoninus campaign to deify hadrian the senate did not oppose the emperors wishes a flamen or cultic priest was appointed to minister the cult of the deified divus antoninus antoninus remains were laid to rest in hadrians mausoleum beside the remains of marcus children and of hadrian himself the temple he had dedicated to his wife diva faustina became the temple of antoninus and faustina it survives as the church of san lorenzo in miranda in accordance with his will antoninus fortune passed on to faustina marcus had little need of his wifes fortune indeed at his accession marcus transferred part of his mothers estate to his nephew ummius quadratus faustina was three months pregnant at her husbands accession during the pregnancy she dreamed of giving birth to two serpents one fiercer than the other on 31 august she gave birth at lanuvium to twins t aurelius fulvus antoninus and lucius aurelius commodus aside from the fact that the twins shared caligulas birthday the omens were favorable and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children the births were celebrated on the imperial coinage early rule soon after the emperors accession marcus eleven-year-old daughter annia lucilla was betrothed to lucius in spite of the fact that he was formally her uncle at the ceremonies commemorating the event new provisions were made for the support of poor children along the lines of earlier imperial foundations marcus and lucius proved popular with the people of rome who strongly approved of their civiliter lacking pomp behaviour the emperors permitted free speech evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution as the biographer wrote no one missed the lenient ways of pius marcus replaced a number of the empires major officials the ab epistulis sextus caecilius crescens volusianus in charge of the imperial correspondence was replaced with titus varius clemens clemens was from the frontier province of pannonia and had served in the war in mauretania recently he had served as procurator of five provinces he was a man suited for a time of military crisis lucius volusius maecianus marcus former tutor had been prefectural governor of egypt at marcus accession maecianus was recalled made senator and appointed prefect of the treasury aerarium saturni he was made consul soon after frontos son-in-law gaius aufidius victorinus was appointed governor of germania superior fronto returned to his roman townhouse at dawn on 28 march having left his home in cirta as soon as news of his pupils accession reached him he sent a note to the imperial freedman charilas asking if he could call on the emperors fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly the tutor was immensely proud of his students reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143 when he had praised the young marcus fronto was ebullient there was then an outstanding natural ability in you there is now perfected excellence there was then a crop of growing corn there is now a ripe gathered harvest what i was hoping for then i have now the hope has become a reality fronto called on marcus alone neither thought to invite lucius lucius was less esteemed by fronto than his brother as his interests were on a lower level lucius asked fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors marcus told fronto of his reading coelius and a little cicero and his family his daughters were in rome with their great-great-aunt matidia marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them he asked fronto for some particularly eloquent reading matter something of your own or cato or cicero or sallust or gracchusor some poet for i need distraction especially in this kind of way by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties marcus early reign proceeded smoothly he was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection soon however he would find he had many anxieties it would mean the end of the felicitas temporum happy times that the coinage of 161 had proclaimed in either autumn 161 or spring 162 the tiber overflowed its banks flooding much of rome it drowned many animals leaving the city in famine marcus and lucius gave the crisis their personal attention in other times of famine the emperors are said to have provided for the italian communities out of the roman granaries frontos letters continued through marcus early reign fronto felt that because of marcus prominence and public duties lessons were more important now than they had ever been before he believed marcus was beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions suppose caesar that you can attain to the wisdom of cleanthes and zeno yet against your will not the philosophers woolen cape the early days of marcus reign were the happiest of frontos life marcus was beloved by the people of rome an excellent emperor a fond pupil and perhaps most importantly as eloquent as could be wished marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at cyzicus it had conveyed the drama of the disaster and the senate had been awed not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech fronto was hugely pleased war with parthia 161166 on his deathbed antoninus spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him one of those kings vologases iv of parthia made his move in late summer or early autumn 161 vologases entered the kingdom of armenia then a roman client state expelled its king and installed his own pacorus an arsacid like himself the governor of cappadocia the frontline in all armenian conflicts was marcus sedatius severianus a gaul with much experience in military matters convinced by the prophet alexander of abonutichus that he could defeat the parthians easily and win glory for himself severianus led a legion perhaps the ix hispana into armenia but was trapped by the great parthian general chosrhoes at elegia a town just beyond the cappadocian frontiers high up past the headwaters of the euphrates after severianus made some unsuccessful efforts to engage chosrhoes he committed suicide and his legion was massacred the campaign had lasted only three days there was threat of war on other frontiers as well in britain and in raetia and upper germany where the chatti of the taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes marcus was unprepared antoninus seems to have given him no military experience the biographer writes that marcus spent the whole of antoninus twenty-three-year reign at his emperors side and not in the provinces where most previous emperors had spent their early careers more bad news arrived the syrian governors army had been defeated by the parthians and retreated in disarray reinforcements were dispatched for the parthian frontier p julius geminius marcianus an african senator commanding x gemina at vindobona vienna left for cappadocia with detachments from the danubian legions three full legions were also sent east i minervia from bonn in upper germany ii adiutrix from aquincum and v macedonica from troesmis the northern frontiers were strategically weakened frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible m annius libo marcus first cousin was sent to replace the syrian governor his first consulship was in 161 so he was probably in his early thirties and as a patrician he lacked military experience marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one marcus took a four-day public holiday at alsium a resort town on the coast of etruria he was too anxious to relax writing to fronto he declared that he would not speak about his holiday fronto replied what do i not know that you went to alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games joking and complete leisure for four whole days he encouraged marcus to rest calling on the example of his predecessors antoninus had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra fishing and comedy going so far as to write up a fable about the gods division of the day between morning and evening marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure marcus could not take frontos advice i have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off he wrote back marcus aurelius put on frontos voice to chastise himself much good has my advice done you you will say he had rested and would rest often but this devotion to duty who knows better than you how demanding it is fronto sent marcus a selection of reading material and to settle his unease over the course of the parthian war a long and considered letter full of historical references in modern editions of frontos works it is labeled de bello parthico on the parthian war there had been reverses in romes past fronto writes but in the end romans had always prevailed over their enemies always and everywhere mars has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs over the winter of 161162 news that a rebellion was brewing in syria arrived and it was decided that lucius should direct the parthian war in person he was stronger and healthier than marcus the argument went and thus more suited to military activity lucius biographer suggests ulterior motives to restrain lucius debaucheries to make him thrifty to reform his morals by the terror of war and to realize that he was an emperor whatever the case the senate gave its assent and in the summer of 162 lucius left marcus would remain in rome as the city demanded the presence of an emperor lucius spent most of the campaign in antioch though he wintered at laodicea and summered at daphne a resort just outside antioch critics declaimed lucius luxurious lifestyle saying that he had taken to gambling would dice the whole night through and enjoyed the company of actors libo died early in the war perhaps lucius had murdered him in the middle of the war perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164 lucius made a trip to ephesus to be married to marcus daughter lucilla marcus moved up the date perhaps he had already heard of lucius mistress panthea lucillas thirteenth birthday was in march 163 whatever the date of her marriage she was not yet fifteen lucilla was accompanied by her mother faustina and lucius uncle his fathers half-brother m vettulenus civica barbarus who was made comes augusti companion of the emperors marcus may have wanted civica to watch over lucius the job libo had failed at marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to smyrna the biographer says he told the senate he would but this did not happen he only accompanied the group as far as brundisium where they boarded a ship for the east he returned to rome immediately thereafter and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception the armenian capital artaxata was captured in 163 at the end of the year lucius took the title armeniacus despite having never seen combat marcus declined to accept the title until the following year when lucius was hailed as imperator again however marcus did not hesitate to take the imperator ii with him occupied armenia was reconstructed on roman terms in 164 a new capital kaine polis new city replaced artaxata a new king was installed a roman senator of consular rank and arsacid descent gaius julius sohaemus he may not even have been crowned in armenia the ceremony may have taken place in antioch or even ephesus sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend rex armeniis datus lucius sat on a throne with his staff while sohaemus stood before him saluting the emperor in 163 the parthians intervened in osroene a roman client in upper mesopotamia centred on edessa and installed their own king on its throne in response roman forces were moved downstream to cross the euphrates at a more southerly point before the end of 163 however roman forces had moved north to occupy dausara and nicephorium on the northern parthian bank soon after the conquest of the north bank of the euphrates other roman forces moved on osroene from armenia taking anthemusia a town southwest of edessa in 165 roman forces moved on mesopotamia edessa was re-occupied and mannus the king deposed by the parthians was re-installed the parthians retreated to nisibis but this too was besieged and captured the parthian army dispersed in the tigris a second force under avidius cassius and the iii gallica moved down the euphrates and fought a major battle at dura by the end of the year cassius army had reached the twin metropolises of mesopotamia seleucia on the right bank of the tigris and ctesiphon on the left ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame the citizens of seleucia still largely greek the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the seleucid empire one of alexander the greats successor kingdoms opened its gates to the invaders the city was sacked nonetheless leaving a black mark on lucius reputation excuses were sought or invented the official version had it that the seleucids broke faith first cassius army although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in seleucia made it back to roman territory safely lucius took the title parthicus maximus and he and marcus were hailed as imperatores again earning the title imp iii cassius army returned to the field in 166 crossing over the tigris into media lucius took the title medicus and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores becoming imp iv in imperial titulature marcus took the parthicus maximus now after another tactful delay on 12 october of that year marcus proclaimed two of his sons annius and commodus as his heirs war with germanic tribes 166180 during the early 160s frontos son-in-law victorinus was stationed as a legate in germany he was there with his wife and children another child had stayed with fronto and his wife in rome the condition on the northern frontier looked grave a frontier post had been destroyed and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern europe were in turmoil there was corruption among the officers victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family lucius dasumius tullius tuscus a distant relative of hadrian was in upper pannonia succeeding the experienced marcus nonius macrinus lower pannonia was under the obscure tiberius haterius saturnius marcus servilius fabianus maximus was shuffled from lower moesia to upper moesia when marcus iallius bassus had joined lucius in antioch lower moesia was filled by pontius laelianus son the dacias were still divided in three governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators the peace could not hold long lower pannonia did not even have a legion starting in the 160s germanic tribes and other nomadic people launched raids along the northern border particularly into gaul and across the danube this new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east a first invasion of the chatti in the province of germania superior was repulsed in 162 far more dangerous was the invasion of 166 when the marcomanni of bohemia clients of the roman empire since 19 ad crossed the danube together with the lombards and other germanic tribes soon thereafter the iranian sarmatians attacked between the danube and the theiss rivers the costoboci coming from the carpathian area invaded moesia macedonia and greece after a long struggle marcus managed to push back the invaders numerous members of germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like dacia pannonia germany and italy itself this was not a new thing but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the danube sarmatia and marcomannia including todays czech republic slovakia and hungary some germanic tribes who settled in ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city for this reason marcus decided not only against bringing more barbarians into italy but even banished those who had previously been brought there legal and administrative work like many emperors marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes but unlike many of his predecessors he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power he took great care in the theory and practice of legislation professional jurists called him an emperor most skilled in the law and a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor he showed marked interest in three areas of the law the manumission of slaves the guardianship of orphans and minors and the choice of city councillors decuriones marcus showed a great deal of respect to the roman senate and routinely asked them for permission to spend money even though he did not need to do so as the absolute ruler of the empire in one speech marcus himself reminded the senate that the imperial palace where he lived was not truly his possession but theirs in 168 he revalued the denarius increasing the silver purity from 79 to 82the actual silver weight increasing from 257 grams to 267 grams however two years later he reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire a possible contact with han china occurred in 166 when a roman traveller visited the han court claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain andun chinese ruler of daqin who can be identified either with marcus or his predecessor antoninus in addition to republican-era roman glasswares found at guangzhou along the south china sea roman golden medallions made during the reign of antoninus and perhaps even marcus have been found at c eo vietnam then part of the kingdom of funan near the chinese province of jiaozhi in northern vietnam this may have been the port city of kattigara described by ptolemy c 150 as being visited by a greek sailor named alexander and laying beyond the golden chersonese ie malay peninsula roman coins from the reigns of tiberius to aurelian have been found in xian china site of the han capital changan although the far greater amount of roman coins in india suggests the roman maritime trade for purchasing chinese silk was centred there not in china or even the overland silk road running through persia plague when lucius army returned from the war with parthia in 166 it brought with it plague cases of plague occurred throughout the empire for years it caused the deaths of a quarter of those it infected in total five million people galen mentions that fever diarrhoea and inflammation of the pharynx along with dry or pustular eruptions of the skin after nine days were among the symptoms and scholars have concluded the pandemic to have been smallpox 19th century medical author heinrich hser believes that it may have been either smallpox or measles however historian j f gilliam concluded in his summary of the written sources with inconclusive greek and latin inscriptions two groups of papyri and coinage there is not enough evidence satisfactorily to identify the disease or diseases the plague struck again between 251 and 266 it may have killed up to 5000 people per day death and succession 180 marcus died on 17 march 180 due to natural causes in the city of vindobona modern vienna he was immediately deified and his ashes were returned to rome where they rested in hadrians mausoleum modern castel santangelo until the visigoth sack of the city in 410 his campaigns against germans and sarmatians were also commemorated by a column and a temple built in rome some scholars consider his death to be the end of the pax romana marcus was succeeded by his son commodus whom he had named caesar in 166 and with whom he had jointly ruled since 177 biological sons of the emperor if there were any were considered heirs however it was only the second time that a non-adoptive son had succeeded his father the only other having been a century earlier when vespasian was succeeded by his son titus historians have criticized the succession to commodus citing commodus erratic behaviour and lack of political and military acumen at the end of his history of marcus reign cassius dio wrote an encomium to the emperor and described the transition to commodus in his own lifetime with sorrow marcus did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign but for my part i admire him all the more for this very reason that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire just one thing prevented him from being completely happy namely that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him this matter must be our next topic for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust as affairs did for the romans of that day dio adds that from marcus first days as counsellor to antoninius to his final days as emperor of rome he remained the same person and did not change in the least michael grant in the climax of rome writes of commodus the youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable but whether or not marcus ought to have known this to be so the rejections of his sons claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions legacy and reputation marcus acquired the reputation of a philosopher king within his lifetime and the title would remain his after death both dio and the biographer call him the philosopher christians such as justin martyr athenagoras and melito also gave him the title the last named went so far as to call him more philanthropic and philosophic than antoninus and hadrian and set him against the persecuting emperors domitian and nero to make the contrast bolder alone of the emperors wrote the historian herodian he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life iain king concludes that marcus legacy is tragic because the emperors stoic philosophywhich is about self-restraint duty and respect for otherswas so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death attitude towards christians in the first two centuries of the christian era it was local roman officials who were largely responsible for the persecution of christians in the second century the emperors treated christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates the number and severity of persecutions of christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of marcus the extent to which marcus himself directed encouraged or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians marriage and children marcus and his cousin-wife faustina had at least 13 children during their 30-year marriage including two sets of twins one son and four daughters outlived their father their children included domitia faustina 147 151 titus aelius antoninus

writings while on campaign between 170 and 180 marcus wrote his meditations in greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement the original title of this work if it had one is unknown meditations as well as other titles including to himself were adopted later he had a logical mind and his notes were representative of stoic philosophy and spirituality meditations is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty according to hays the book was a favourite of christina of sweden frederick the great john stuart mill matthew arnold and goethe and is admired by modern figures such as wen jiabao and bill clinton it has been considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy it is not known how widely marcus writings were circulated after his death there are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts and julian the apostate was well aware of his reputation as a philosopher though he does not specifically mention meditations it survived in the scholarly traditions of the eastern church and the first surviving quotes of the book as well as the first known reference of it by name marcus writings to himself are from arethas of caesarea in the 10th century and in the byzantine suda perhaps inserted by arethas himself it was first published in 1558 in zurich by wilhelm xylander ne holzmann from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards the oldest surviving complete manuscript copy is in the vatican library and dates to the 14th century equestrian statue of marcus aurelius the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius in rome is the only roman equestrian statue which has survived into the modern period this is perhaps due to it being wrongly identified during the middle ages as a depiction of the christian emperor constantine the great and hence spared destruction unlike some other statues associated with paganism crafted of bronze in circa 175 ad it stands 116ft 35m and is now located in the capitoline museums of rome the emperors hand is outstretched in an act of clemency offered to a bested enemy while his weary facial expression due to the stress of leading rome into nearly constant battles perhaps represents a break with the classical tradition of sculpture a close up view of the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius in the capitoline museums a
