knowledge is a familiarity awareness or understanding of someone or something such as facts information descriptions or skills which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving discovering or learning knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject it can be implicit as with practical skill or expertise or explicit as with the theoretical understanding of a subject it can be more or less formal or systematic in philosophy the study of knowledge is called epistemology the philosopher plato famously defined knowledge as justified true belief though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers to be problematic because of the gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition however several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes perception communication and reasoning while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of acknowledgement in human beings theories of knowledge the eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophys core was theory of knowledge a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their foundation without this idea of a theory of knowledge it is hard to imagine what philosophy could have been in the age of modern science the definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology the classical definition described but not ultimately endorsed by plato specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge it must be justified true and believed some claim that these conditions are not sufficient as gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate there are a number of alternatives proposed including robert nozicks arguments for a requirement that knowledge tracks the truth and simon blackburns additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions through a defect flaw or failure have knowledge richard kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth in contrast to this approach ludwig wittgenstein observed following moores paradox that one can say he believes it but it isnt so but not he knows it but it isnt so he goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction what is different here is not the mental state of the speaker but the activity in which they are engaged for example on this account to know that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way knowledge is used in natural languages he saw knowledge as a case of a family resemblance following this idea knowledge has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition communicating knowledge symbolic representations can be used to indicate meaning and can be thought of as a dynamic process hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one ascription process whereby knowledge can be transferred other forms of communication include observation and imitation verbal exchange and audio and video recordings philosophers of language and semioticians construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication while many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading of many kinds argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies in his collection of essays technopoly neil postman demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from platos work phaedrus postman neil 1992 technopoly vintage new york p73 in this excerpt the scholar socrates recounts the story of thamus the egyptian king and theuth the inventor of the written word in this story theuth presents his new invention writing to king thamus telling thamus that his new invention will improve both the wisdom and memory of the egyptians postman neil 1992 technopoly vintage new york p74 king thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge he argues that the written word will infect the egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves postman neil 1992 technopoly vintage new york p74 classical early modern theories of knowledge especially those advancing the influential empiricism of the philosopher john locke were based implicitly or explicitly on a model of the mind which likened ideas to words this analogy between language and thought laid the foundation for a graphic conception of knowledge in which the mind was treated as a table a container of content that had to be stocked with facts reduced to letters numbers or symbols this created a situation in which the spatial alignment of words on the page carried great cognitive weight so much so that educators paid very close attention to the visual structure of information on the page and in notebooks major libraries today can have millions of books of knowledge in addition to works of fiction it is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those who would have contact with the transmitter or someone who could interpret written work writing is still the most available and most universal of all forms of recording and transmitting knowledge it stands unchallenged as mankinds primary technology of knowledge transfer down through the ages and to all cultures and languages of the world haraway on situated knowledge situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation it was used by donna haraway as an extension of the feminist approaches of successor science suggested by sandra harding one which offers a more adequate richer better account of a world in order to live in it well and in critical reflexive relation to our own as well as others practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions this situation partially transforms science into a narrative which arturo escobar explains as neither fictions nor supposed facts this narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction and as escobar explains further even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency it is to treat this narrative in the most serious way without succumbing to its mystification as the truth or to the ironic skepticism common to many critiques haraways argument stems from the limitations of the human perception as well as the overemphasis of the sense of vision in science according to haraway vision in science has been used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere this is the gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen to represent while escaping representation this causes a limitation of views in the position of science itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge resulting in a position of modest witness this is what haraway terms a god trick or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation in order to avoid this haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the subject in terms of both ethical and political accountability some methods of generating knowledge such as trial and error or learning from experience tend to create highly situational knowledge situational knowledge is often embedded in language culture or traditions this integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment of views from somewhere even though haraways arguments are largely based on feminist studies this idea of different worlds as well as the skeptic stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of post-structuralism fundamentally both argue the contingency of knowledge on the presence of history power and geography as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures and the idea of power as an inherited trait of objectification partial knowledge one discipline of epistemology focuses on partial knowledge in most cases it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively our knowledge is always incomplete or partial most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them this idea is also present in the concept of bounded rationality which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly intuition is the ability to acquire partial knowledge without inference or the use of reason an individual may know about a situation and be unable to explain the process that led to their knowledge scientific knowledge the development of the scientific method has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired to be termed scientific a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning and experimentation the scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation and the formulation and testing of hypotheses science and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of philosophy as science itself has developed scientific knowledge now includes a broader usage in the soft sciences such as biology and the social sciences discussed elsewhere as meta-epistemology or genetic epistemology and to some extent related to theory of cognitive development note that epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired science is the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments sir francis bacon was critical in the historical development of the scientific method his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry his famous aphorism knowledge is power is found in the meditations sacrae 1597 until recent times at least in the western tradition it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans and probably adult humans at that sometimes the notion might stretch to society-as-such as in eg the knowledge possessed by the coptic culture as opposed to its individual members but that was not assured either nor was it usual to consider unconscious knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by freud other biological domains where knowledge might be said to reside include iii the immune system and iv in the dna of the genetic code see the list of four epistemological domains popper 1975 and traill 2008 tables p31 also references by both to niels jerne such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of knowledge to cover the biological systems for biologists knowledge must be usefully available to the system though that system need not be conscious thus the criteria seem to be the system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing unlike a mere book on its own the knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of the outside world or ways of dealing with it directly or indirectly some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful scientific knowledge may not involve a claim to certainty maintaining skepticism means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not it is thus an irony of proper scientific method that one must doubt even when correct in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the truth in general religious meaning of knowledge in many expressions of christianity such as catholicism and anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the holy spirit the old testaments tree of the knowledge of good and evil contained the knowledge that separated man from god and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil
