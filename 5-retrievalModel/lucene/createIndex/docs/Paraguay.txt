only two landlocked countries in south america the other is bolivia it is bordered by argentina to the south and southwest brazil to the east and northeast and bolivia to the northwest paraguay lies on both banks of the paraguay river which runs through the center of the country from north to south due to its central location in south america it is sometimes referred to as corazn de sudamrica heart of south america spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the ro de la plata to the paran river and finally up the paraguay river in 1537 they established the city of asuncin which was the first capital of the governorate of paraguay and ro de la plata paraguay was the epicenter of the jesuit missions where the guaran people were educated and introduced to christianity and european culture under the direction of the society of jesus in jesuit reductions mainly during the 17th century however after the expulsion of the jesuits from spanish territories in 1767 paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony with few urban centers and settlers following independence from spain at the beginning of the 19th century paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist isolationist and protectionist policies this period ended with the disastrous paraguayan war during which paraguay lost at least 50 of its prewar population and around 2533 of its territory to the triple alliance of argentina brazil and uruguay in the 20th century paraguay faced another major international conflict the chaco war against bolivia from which the paraguayans emerged victorious afterwards the country entered a period of military dictatorships ending with the 35 year regime of alfredo stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup this marked the beginning of the democratic era of paraguay with around 7 million inhabitants paraguay is a founding member of mercosur an original member of the united nations the organization of american states the non-aligned movement and the lima group also the city of luque in asuncions metropolitan area is the seat of the conmebol the guarani culture is very influential and more than 90 of the people speak different forms of the guarani language paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country topped the worlds happiest place charts because of the positive experiences lived and expressed by the population history pre-columbian era the indigenous guaran had been living in eastern paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the spanish western paraguay the gran chaco was inhabited by nomads of whom the guaycuru peoples were the most prominent the paraguay river was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the gran chaco the guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century these indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families which were the bases of their major divisions differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories they were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families today 17 separate ethnolinguistic groups remain colonization the first europeans in the area were spanish explorers in 1516 the spanish explorer juan de salazar de espinosa founded the settlement of asuncin on 15 august 1537 the city eventually became the center of a spanish colonial province of paraguay an attempt to create an autonomous christian indian nation was undertaken by jesuit missions and settlements in this part of south america in the eighteenth century which included portions of uruguay argentina and brazil they developed jesuit reductions to bring guarani populations together at spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by spanish settlers and portuguese slave raiders the bandeirantes in addition to seeking their conversion to christianity catholicism in paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples the syncretic religion has absorbed native elements the reducciones flourished in eastern paraguay for about 150 years until the expulsion of the jesuits by the spanish crown in 1767 the ruins of two 18th-century jesuit missions of la santsima trinidad de paran and jess de tavarangue have been designated as world heritage sites by unesco in western paraguay spanish settlement and christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic guaycuru and other nomads from the 16th century onward most of these peoples were absorbed into the mestizo population in the 18th and 19th centuries independence and rule of francia paraguay overthrew the local spanish administration on 14 may 1811 paraguays first dictator was jos gaspar rodrguez de francia who ruled paraguay from 1814 until his death in 1840 with very little outside contact or influence he intended to create a utopian society based on the french theorist jean-jacques rousseaus social contract rodrguez de francia established new laws that greatly reduced the powers of the catholic church catholicism was then an established state religion and the cabinet forbade colonial citizens from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks mulattoes or natives in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a mixed-race or mestizo society he cut off relations between paraguay and the rest of south america because of francias restrictions of freedom fulgencio yegros and several other independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a coup dtat against francia who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life rule of the lpez family after francias death in 1840 paraguay was ruled by various military officers under a new junta until carlos antonio lpez allegedly rodrguez de francias nephew came to power in 1841 lpez modernized paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce he signed a non-aggression pact with argentina and officially declared independence of paraguay in 1842 after lpezs death in 1862 power was transferred to his eldest son francisco solano lpez the regime of the lpez family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution there was no distinction between the public and the private spheres and the lpez family ruled the country as it would a large estate the government exerted control on all exports the export of yerba mate and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between paraguay and the outside world the paraguayan government was extremely protectionist never accepted loans from abroad and levied high tariffs against imported foreign products this protectionism made the society self-sufficient and it also avoided the debt suffered by argentina and brazil slavery existed in paraguay although not in great numbers until 1844 when it was legally abolished in the new constitution francisco solano lpez the son of carlos antonio lpez replaced his father as the president-dictator in 1862 and generally continued the political policies of his father both wanted to give an international image of paraguay as democratic and republican but in fact the ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country including church and colleges militarily carlos antonio lpez modernized and expanded industry and the paraguayan army and greatly strengthened the strategic defences of paraguay by developing the fortress of humait the government hired more than 200 foreign technicians who installed telegraph lines and railroads to aid the expanding steel textile paper and ink naval construction weapons and gunpowder industries the ybycu foundry completed in 1850 manufactured cannons mortars and bullets of all calibers river warships were built in the shipyards of asuncin fortifications were built especially along the apa river and in gran chaco the work was continued by his son francisco solano and in terms of socio-economic development the country was dubbed as the most advanced republic in south america notably by the british judge and politician sir robert phillimore according to george thompson ce lieutenant colonel of engineers in the paraguayan army prior to and during the war lpezs government was comparatively a good one for paraguay probably in no other country in the world has life and property been so secure as all over paraguay during his antonio lopezs reign crime was almost unknown and when committed immediately detected and punished the mass of the people was perhaps the happiest in existence they had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood each family had its house or hut in its own ground they planted in a few days enough tobacco maize and mandioca for their own consumption having at every hut a grove of oranges and also a few cows they were almost throughout the year under little necessity the higher classes of course lived more in the european way paraguayan war 18641870 on 12 october 1864 despite paraguayan ultimatums the brazilian empire sided with the argentine government under gen bartolom mitre and the rebellious uruguayan colorados led by gen venancio flores invaded the republic of uruguay in order to overthrow the government of that time which was under the rule of the blanco party an ally of lpez thus starting the paraguayan war the paraguayans led by the marshal of the republic francisco solano lpez retalliated by attacking the matto grosso on 15 december 1864 and later declared war against argentina on 23 march 1865 the blanco government was toppled and replaced by a colorado government under gen venancio flores on 22 february 1865 and afterwards the argentine republic the empire of brazil and the republic of uruguay signed the infamous secret treaty of the triple alliance against the paraguayan government on 1 may 1865 the paraguayans held a ferocious resistance but were ultimately defeated in 1870 after the battle of cerro cor where marshal solano lpez was killed in action refusing to surrender the real causes of this war which remains the bloodiest international conflict in the history of the americas are still highly debated paraguay lost around 25 - 33 of its territory to argentina and brazil was forced to pay an enormous war debt and to sell large amounts of national properties in order to restore its internal budget but the worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population at least 50 of the paraguayans died during the conflict and took long decades for the country to recover about the disaster suffered by the paraguayans at the outcome of the war william d rubinstein wrote the normal estimate is that of a paraguayan population of somewhere between 450000 and 900000 only 220000 survived the war of whom only 28000 were adult males during the pillaging of asuncin in 1869 the imperial brazilian army packed up and transported the paraguayan national archives to rio de janeiro brazils records from the war have remained classified this has made paraguayan history in the colonial and early national periods difficult to research and study 20th century in 1904 the liberal revolution against the rule of colorados broke out the liberal rule started a period of great political instability between 1904 and 1954 paraguay had thirty-one presidents most of whom were removed from office by force conflicts between the factions of the ruling liberal party led to the paraguayan civil war of 1922 the unresolved border conflict with bolivia over the chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the chaco war after great losses paraguay defeated bolivia and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed chaco region after the war military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves on 17 february 1936 the february revolution brought colonel rafael franco to power between 1940 and 1948 the country was ruled by general higinio mornigo dissatisfaction with his rule resulted in the paraguayan civil war of 1947 in its aftermath alfredo stroessner began involvement in a string of plots which resulted in his military coup dtat of 4 may 1954 stroessner era 19541989 a series of unstable governments ensued until the establishment in 1954 of the regime of dictator alfredo stroessner who remained in office for more than three decades until 1989 paraguay was modernized to some extent under stroessners regime although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses stroessner and the colorado party ruled the country from 1954 to 1989 the dictator oversaw an era of economic expansion but also had a poor human rights and environmental record see political history paraguay actively participated in operation condor torture and death for political opponents was routine after his overthrow the colorado continued to dominate national politics until 2008 the splits in the colorado party in the 1980s and the prevailing conditions stroessners advanced age the character of the regime the economic downturn and international isolation were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections plra leader domingo lano served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s the governments effort to isolate laino by exiling him in 1982 had backfired on his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986 laino returned with three television crews from the us a former united states ambassador to paraguay and a group of uruguayan and argentine congressmen despite the international contingent the police violently barred lainos return the stroessner regime relented in april 1987 and permitted laino to return to asuncin laino took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party the opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections with some parties advocating abstention and others calling for blank voting the parties held numerous lightning demonstrations mtines relmpagos especially in rural areas such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police in response to the upsurge in opposition activities stroessner condemned the accord for advocating sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law he used national police and civilian vigilantes of the colorado party to break up demonstrations a number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed hermes rafael saguier another key leader of the plra was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition in early february 1988 police arrested 200 people attending a national coordinating committee meeting in coronel oviedo laino and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election 14 february and held for twelve hours the government declared stroessners re-election with 89 of the vote the opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual colorado monopoly on the mass media they noted that 53 of those polled indicated that there was an uneasiness in paraguayan society 74 believed that the political situation needed changes including 45 who wanted a substantial or total change finally 31 stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the february elections stroessners overthrow post-1989 on 3 february 1989 stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by general andrs rodrguez as president rodrguez instituted political legal and economic reforms and initiated a rapprochement with the international community reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to stroessner and his associates by mid-1990 19000 families occupied 340000 acres 138000ha at the time 206 million people lived in rural areas more than half of the 41 million total population and most were landless the june 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights in may 1993 colorado party candidate juan carlos wasmosy was elected as paraguays first civilian president in almost 40 years in what international observers deemed fair and free elections with support from the united states the organization of american states and other countries in the region the paraguayan people rejected an april 1996 attempt by then army chief general lino oviedo to oust president wasmosy oviedo was nominated as the colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election however when the supreme court upheld in april his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail his former running mate ral cubas became the colorado partys candidate and was elected in may in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair one of cubas first acts after taking office in august was to commute oviedos sentence and release him in december 1998 paraguays supreme court declared these actions unconstitutional in this tense atmosphere the murder of vice president and long-time oviedo rival luis mara argaa on 23 march 1999 led the chamber of deputies to impeach cubas the next day on 26 march eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered widely believed to have been carried out by oviedo supporters this increased opposition to cubas who resigned on 28 march senate president luis gonzlez macchi a cubas opponent was peacefully sworn in as president the same day in 2003 nicanor duarte frutos was elected as president election of fernando lugo for the 2008 general elections the colorado party was favored in polls their candidate was minister of education blanca ovelar the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in paraguayan history after sixty years of colorado rule voters chose fernando lugo a former roman catholic bishop and not a professional politician in civil government and a member of the authentic radical liberal party paraguays largest opposition party lugo was an adherent of liberation theology lugo achieved a historic victory in paraguays presidential election defeating the ruling party candidate and ending 61 years of conservative rule lugo won with nearly 41 of the vote compared to almost 31 for blanca ovelar of the colorado party outgoing president nicanor duarte frutos hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion lugo was sworn in on 15 august 2008 the lugo administration set its two major priorities as the reduction of corruption and economic inequality political instability following lugos election and disputes within his cabinet encouraged some renewal of popular support for the colorado party reports suggested that the businessman horacio cartes became the new political figure amid disputes despite the us drug enforcement administrations strong accusations against cartes related to drug trafficking he continued to amass followers in the political arena on 14 january 2011 the colorado party convention nominated horacio cartes as the presidential candidate for the party however the partys constitution didnt allow it on 21 june 2012 impeachment proceedings against president lugo began in the countrys lower house which was controlled by his opponents lugo was given less than twenty-four hours to prepare for the proceedings and only two hours in which to mount a defense impeachment was quickly approved and the resulting trial in paraguays senate also controlled by the opposition ended with the removal of lugo from office and vice president federico franco assuming the duties of president lugos rivals blamed him for the deaths of 17 people eight police officers and nine farmers in armed clashes after police were ambushed by armed peasants when enforcing an eviction order against rural trespassers lugos supporters gathered outside congress to protest the decision as a politically motivated coup dtat lugos removal from office on 22 june 2012 is considered by unasur and other neighboring countries especially those currently governed by leftist leaders as a coup dtat however the organization of american states which sent a mission to paraguay to gather information concluded that the impeachment process was not a coup dtat as it had been carried out in accordance with the constitution of paraguay present day from august 2013 to 15 august 2018 the president of paraguay was horacio cartes since 15 august 2018 the current president of paraguay is mario abdo bentez geography and climate geography paraguay is divided by the ro paraguay into two well differentiated geographic regions the eastern region regin oriental and the western region officially called western paraguay regin occidental and also known as the chaco which is part of the gran chaco the country lies between latitudes 19 and 28s and longitudes 54 and 63w the terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region to the west are mostly low marshy plains climate the overall climate is tropical to subtropical like most lands in the region paraguay has only wet and dry periods winds play a major role in influencing paraguays weather between october and march warm winds blow from the amazon basin in the north while the period between may and august brings cold winds from the andes the absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as 161kmh 100mph this also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time between april and september temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing january is the hottest summer month with an average daily temperature of 289 degrees celsius 84 degrees f rainfall varies dramatically across the country with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions and semi-arid conditions in the far west the far eastern forest belt receives an average of 170 centimeters 67 inches of rain annually while the western chaco region typically averages no more than 50cm 20in a year the rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly contributing to the aridity of the area government and politics paraguay is a representative democratic republic with a multi-party system and separation of powers in three branches executive power is exercised solely by the president who is head of state and head of government legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the national congress the judiciary is vested on tribunals and courts of civil law and a nine-member supreme court of justice all of them independent of the executive and the legislature military the military of paraguay consist of the paraguayan army navy including naval aviation and marine corps and air force the constitution of paraguay article 238 establishes the president of paraguay as the commander-in-chief paraguay has compulsory military service and all 18-year-old males and 17-year-olds in the year of their 18th birthday are liable for one year of active duty although the 1992 constitution allows for conscientious objection no enabling legislation has yet been approved in july 2005 military aid in the form of us special forces began arriving at paraguays mariscal estigarribia air base a sprawling complex built in 1982 administrative subdivisions paraguay consists of seventeen departments and one capital district distrito capital it is also divided into 2 regions the occidental region or chaco boquern alto paraguay and presidente hayes and the oriental region the other departments and the capital district these are the departments with their capitals population area and the number of districts the departments are further divided into districts distritos economy between 1970 and 2013 the country had the highest economic growth of south america with an average rate of 72 per year in 2010 and 2013 paraguay experienced the greatest economic expansion of south america with a gdp growth rate of 145 and 136 respectively 999 of paraguays electricity is produced using hydroelectricity making it one of the cleanest in the world paraguay has an installed electrical production capacity of 8110 mw producing 63 billion kwhyear in 2016 with domestic consumption of just 15 billion kwh the excess production is sold to brazil argentina and uruguay making paraguay the worlds largest exporter of electric power this production is from two large hydroelectric power projects along its borders including the itaipu dam the worlds second largest generating station paraguay is the sixth-largest soybean producer in the world second-largest producer of stevia second-largest producer of tung oil sixth-largest exporter of corn tenth-largest exporter of wheat and 8th largest exporter of beef the market economy is distinguished by a large informal sector featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries as well as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors nonetheless over the last 10 years the paraguayan economy diversified dramatically with the energy auto parts and clothing industries leading the way the country also boasts the third most important free commercial zone in the world ciudad del este trailing behind miami and hong kong a large percentage of the population especially in rural areas derives its living from agricultural activity often on a subsistence basis because of the importance of the informal sector accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain the economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2013 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support paraguays commodity-based export expansion in 2012 paraguays government introduced the mercosurfocem system in order to stimulate the economy and job growth through a partnership with both brazil and argentina industry and manufacturing the mineral industry of paraguay produces about 25 of the countrys gross domestic product gdp and employs about 31 of the labor force production of cement iron ore and steel occurs commonly throughout paraguays industrial sector the growth of the industry was further fueled by the maquila industry with large industrial complexes located in the eastern part of the country paraguay put in place many incentives aimed to attract industries to the country one of them is the so-called maquila law by which companies can relocate to paraguay enjoying minimal tax rates in the pharmaceutical industry paraguayan companies now meet 70 of domestic consumption and have begun to export drugs paraguay is quickly supplanting foreign suppliers in meeting the countrys drug needs strong growth also is evident in the production of edible oils garments organic sugar meat processing and steel in 2003 manufacturing made up 136 of the gdp and the sector employed about 11 of the working population in 2000 paraguays primary manufacturing focus is on food and beverages wood products paper products hides and furs and non-metallic mineral products also contribute to manufacturing totals steady growth in the manufacturing gdp during the 1990s 12 annually laid the foundation for 2002 and 2003 when the annual growth rate rose to 25 social issues various poverty estimates suggest that 3050 of the population is poor in rural areas 4120 of the people lack a monthly income to cover basic necessities whereas in urban centers this figure is 276 the top 10 of the population holds 438 of the national income while the lowest 10 has 05 the economic recession has worsened income inequality notably in the rural areas where the gini coefficient has risen from 056 in 1995 to 066 in 1999 more recent data 2009 show that 35 of the paraguayan population is poor 19 of which live in extreme poverty moreover 71 of the latter live in rural areas of the country similarly land concentration in the paraguayan countryside is one of the highest in the globe 10 of the population controls 66 of the land while 30 of the rural people are landless in the immediate aftermath of the 1989 overthrow of stroessner some 19000 rural families occupied hundreds of thousands of acres of unused lands formerly held by the dictator and his associates by mid-1990 but many rural poor remained landless this inequality has caused a great deal of tensions between the landless and land owners social issues of the indigenous literacy rates are extremely low among paraguays indigenous population who have an illiteracy rate of 51 compared to the 71 rate of the general population only 25 of paraguays indigenous population has access to clean drinking water and only 95 have electricity demographics paraguays population is distributed unevenly through the country with the vast majority of people living in the eastern region near the capital and largest city asuncin which accounts for 10 of the countrys population the gran chaco region which includes the alto paraguay boquern and presidente hayes department and accounts for about 60 of the territory is home to less than 2 of the population about 56 of paraguayans live in urban areas making paraguay one of the least urbanized nations in south america for most of its history paraguay has been a recipient of immigrants owing to its low population density especially after the demographic collapse that resulted from the paraguayan war small groups of ethnic italians germans russians japanese koreans chinese arabs ukrainians poles jews brazilians and argentines have also settled in paraguay around 40 of the total paraguayan population has some italian descent paraguay has also been a haven for communities persecuted for the religious faith like the bruderhof who were forced to leave england in 1941 because of their pacifist beliefs many of these communities have retained their languages and culture particularly the brazilians who represent the largest and most prominent immigrant group at around 400000 many brazilian paraguayans are of german italian and polish descent there are an estimated 63000 afro-paraguayans comprising 1 of the population there is no official data on the ethnic composition of the paraguayan population as the department of statistics surveys and censuses of paraguay does not ask about race and ethnicity in census surveys although it does inquire about the indigenous population according to the census of 2002 the indigenous people made up 17 of paraguays total population traditionally the majority of the paraguayan population is considered mixed mestizo in spanish hla-drb1 polymorphism studies have shown the genetic distances between paraguayans and spanish populations were closer than between paraguayans and guaranis altogether these results suggest the predominance of the spanish genetic in the paraguayan population according to the 2017 revision of the world population prospects paraguay has a population of 6725308 95 of which are mestizo or white and 5 are labelled as other which includes members of indigenous tribal groups they are divided into 17 distinct ethnolinguistic groupings many of which are poorly documented paraguay has one of the most prominent german communities in south america with some 25000 german-speaking mennonites living in the paraguayan chaco german settlers founded several towns as hohenau filadelfia neuland obligado and nueva germania several websites that promote german immigration to paraguay claim that 57 of the population is of german ancestry including 150000 people of german-brazilian descent religion christianity particularly roman catholicism is the dominant religion in paraguay according to the 2002 census 899 of the population is catholic 62 is evangelical protestant 11 identify with other christian sects and 06 practice indigenous religions a us state department report on religious freedom names roman catholicism evangelical protestantism mainline protestantism judaism orthodox conservative and reform mormonism and the bah faith as prominent religious groups it also mentions a large muslim community in alto paran as a result of middle-eastern immigration especially from lebanon and a prominent mennonite community in boquern languages paraguay is a bilingual nation both spanish and guaran are official languages the guarani language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous guaran culture that has endured in paraguay which is generally understood by 95 of the population guaran claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of south american indigenous national languages in 2015 spanish was spoken by about 87 of the population while guaran is spoken by more than 90 or slightly more than 58 million speakers 52 of rural paraguayans are bilingual in guaran while guaran is still widely spoken spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government business media and education as one of south americas lingua francas largest cities culture paraguays cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive intermarriage between the original male spanish settlers and indigenous guaran women their culture is highly influenced by various european countries including spain therefore paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions one european the other southern guaran more than 93 of paraguayans are mestizos making paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in latin america a characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day more than 80 of paraguayans speak both spanish and the indigenous language guaran jopara a mixture of guaran and spanish is also widely spoken this cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery ao po and lace making andut the music of paraguay which consists of lilting polkas bouncy galopas and languid guaranias is played on the native harp paraguays culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion several popular dishes contain manioc a local staple crop similar to the yuca also known as cassava root found in the southwestern united states and mexico as well as other indigenous ingredients a popular dish is sopa paraguaya similar to a thick corn bread another notable food is chipa a bagel-like bread made from cornmeal manioc and cheese many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses onions bell peppers cottage cheese cornmeal milk seasonings butter eggs and fresh corn kernels the 1950s and 1960s were the time of the flowering of a new generation of paraguayan novelists and poets such as jos ricardo maz roque vallejos and nobel prize nominee augusto roa bastos several paraguayan films have been made inside the family conservative values predominate in lower classes godparents have a special relationship to the family since usually they are chosen because of their favorable social position in order to provide extra security for the children particular respect is owed them in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage sports sport in paraguay is an important part the countrys national culture football is the most popular sport and basketball is also very popular other sports such as volleyball futsal swimming and tennis are also popular additional paraguayan sports and pastimes include rugby union chess motorsport golf and rowing education literacy was about 936 and 877 of paraguayans finish the 5th grade according to unescos last
