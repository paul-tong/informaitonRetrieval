the term apsis greek plural apsides psdiz greek orbit refers to an extreme point in the orbit of an object it denotes either the points on the orbit or the respective distance of the bodies the word comes via latin from greek there denoting a whole orbit and is cognate with apse except for the theoretical possibility of one common circular orbit for two bodies of equal mass at diametral positions symmetric binary star there are two apsides for any elliptic orbit named with the prefixes peri- from peri meaning near and ap-apo- from ap meaning away from added to a reference to the body being orbited all periodic orbits are according to newtons laws of motion ellipses either the two individual ellipses of both bodies see the two graphs in the second figure with the center of mass or barycenter of this two-body system at the one common focus of the ellipses or the orbital ellipses with one body taken as fixed at one focus and the other body orbiting this focus see top figure all these ellipses share a straight line the line of apsides that contains their major axes the greatest diameter the foci and the vertices and thus also the periapsis and the apoapsis see both figures the major axis of the orbital ellipse top figure is the distance of the apsides when taken as points on the orbit or their sum when taken as distances the major axes of the individual ellipses around the barycenter respectively the contributions to the major axis of the orbital ellipses are inverse proportional to the masses of the bodies ie a bigger mass implies a smaller axiscontribution only when one mass is sufficiently larger than the other the individual ellipse of the smaller body around the barycenter comprises the individual ellipse of the larger body as shown in the second figure for remarkable asymmetry the barycenter of the two bodies may lie well within the bigger body eg the earthmoon barycenter is about 75 of the way from earths center to its surface if the smaller mass is negligible compared to the larger then the orbital parameters are independent of the smaller mass eg for satellites for general orbits the terms periapsis and apoapsis or apapsis are used pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives referring explicitly to the respective points on the orbits whereas periapsis and apoapsis may also refer to the smallest and largest distances of the orbiter and its host for a body orbiting the sun the point of least distance is the perihelion prhilin and the point of greatest distance is the aphelion philin the terms become periastron and apastron when discussing orbits around other stars for any satellite of earth including the moon the point of least distance is the perigee prdi and greatest distance the apogee from ancient greek g land or earth for objects in lunar orbit the point of least distance is sometimes called the pericynthion prsnin and the greatest distance the apocynthion psnin perilune and apolune are also used in orbital mechanics the apsides technically refer to the distance measured between the barycenters of the central body and orbiting body however in the case of a spacecraft the terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft above the surface of the central body assuming a constant standard reference radius mathematical formulae these formulae characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbit while in accordance with keplers laws of planetary motion based on the conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy these two quantities are constant for a given orbit where a is the semi-major axis a r per r ap 2 displaystyle afrac rtextperrtextap2 is the standard gravitational parameter e is the eccentricity defined as e r ap r per r ap r per 1 2 r ap r per 1 displaystyle efrac rtextap-rtextperrtextaprtextper1-frac 2frac rtextaprtextper1 note that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and conversely the arithmetic mean of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis a the geometric mean of the two distances is the length of the semi-minor axis b the geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is which is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is a displaystyle a terminology the words pericenter and apocenter are often seen although periapsisapoapsis are preferred in technical usage various related terms are used for other celestial objects the -gee -helion -astron and -galacticon forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix -jove is occasionally used for jupiter while -saturnium has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the -gee form is commonly used as a generic closest approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the moon regarding black holes the term periapomelasma from a greek root was used by physicist and science-fiction author geoffrey a landis in a 1998 story before periaponigricon from latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002 as well as periapobothron from greek bothros meaning hole or pit terminology summary the following suffixes are added to peri- and apo- to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objects for the solar system objects only the suffixes for the earth and sun are commonly used the other suffixes are rarely used instead the generic suffix of -apsis is used perihelion and aphelion etymology the words perihelion and aphelion were coined by johannes kepler to describe the orbital motion of the planets the words are formed from the prefixes peri- greek near and apo- greek away from affixed to the greek word for the sun earth currently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earths center is about 6999983290000000000098329 astronomical units au or 147098070km 91402500mi from the suns center in contrast the earth reaches aphelion currently in early july approximately 14 days after the june solstice the aphelion distance between the earths and suns centers is currently about 7011152097651119397101671au or 152097700km 94509100mi dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles in the short term the dates of perihelion and aphelion can vary up to 2 days from one year to another this significant variation is due to the presence of the moon while the earthmoon barycenter is moving on a stable orbit around the sun the position of the earths center which is on average about 4700 kilometres 2900mi from the barycenter could be shifted in any direction from it and this affects the timing of the actual closest approach between the suns and the earths centers which in turn defines the timing of perihelion in a given year because of the increased distance at aphelion only 9355 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given area of land as does at perihelion however this fluctuation does not account for the seasons as it is summer in the northern hemisphere when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa instead seasons result from the tilt of earths axis which is 234 degrees away from perpendicular to the plane of earths orbit around the sun winter falls on the hemisphere where sunlight strikes least directly and summer falls where sunlight strikes most directly regardless of the earths distance from the sun in the northern hemisphere summer occurs at the same time as aphelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 23c 4f warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions astronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so-called longitude of the periapsis also called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 it was about 282895 by the year 2010 this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283067 for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earths eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycles on a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22000 to 26000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession this is closely related to the precession of the axis the dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following table other planets the following table shows the distances of the planets and dwarf planets from the sun at their perihelion and aphelion the following chart shows the range of distances of the planets dwarf
