the russian empire also known as imperial russia or simply russia was an empire that existed across eurasia and north america from 1721 following the end of the great northern war until the republic was proclaimed by the provisional government that took power after the february revolution of 1917 the third largest empire in world history at its greatest extent stretching over three continents europe asia and north america the russian empire was surpassed in landmass only by the british and mongol empires the rise of the russian empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers the swedish empire the polishlithuanian commonwealth persia and the ottoman empire it played a major role in 18121814 in defeating napoleons ambitions to control europe and expanded to the west and south the house of romanov ruled the russian empire from 1721 until 1762 and its matrilineal branch of patrilineal german descent the house of holstein-gottorp-romanov ruled from 1762 at the beginning of the 19th century the russian empire extended from the arctic ocean in the north to the black sea in the south from the baltic sea on the west to the pacific ocean into alaska and northern california in america on the east with 1256 million subjects registered by the 1897 census it had the third-largest population in the world at the time after qing china and india like all empires it included a large disparity in terms of economics ethnicity and religion there were numerous dissident elements who launched numerous rebellions and assassination attempts they were closely watched by the secret police with thousands exiled to siberia economically the empire had a predominantly agricultural base with low productivity on large estates worked by serfs russian peasants until they were freed in 1861 the economy slowly industrialized with the help of foreign investments in railways and factories the land was ruled by a nobility the boyars from the 10th through the 17th centuries and subsequently by an emperor tsar ivan iii 14621505 laid the groundwork for the empire that later emerged he tripled the territory of his state ended the dominance of the golden horde renovated the moscow kremlin and laid the foundations of the russian state emperor peter the great 16821725 fought numerous wars and expanded an already huge empire into a major european power he moved the capital from moscow to the new model city of st petersburg and led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political mores with a modern scientific europe-oriented and rationalist system empress catherine the great reigned 17621796 presided over a golden age she expanded the state by conquest colonization and diplomacy continuing peter the greats policy of modernization along western european lines emperor alexander ii 18551881 promoted numerous reforms most dramatically the emancipation of all 23 million serfs in 1861 his policy in eastern europe involved protecting the orthodox christians under the rule of the ottoman empire that connection by 1914 led to russias entry into the first world war on the side of france the united kingdom and serbia against the german austrian and ottoman empires the russian empire functioned as an absolute monarchy on principles of orthodoxy autocracy and nationality until the revolution of 1905 and then became a de jure constitutional monarchy the empire collapsed during the february revolution of 1917 largely as a result of massive failures in its participation in the first world war history though the empire was only officially proclaimed by tsar peter i following the treaty of nystad 1721 some historians would argue that it was truly born either when ivan iii of russia conquered veliky novgorod in 1478 or when ivan the terrible conquered the khanate of kazan in 1552 according to another point of view the term tsardom which was used after the coronation of ivan iv in 1547 was already a contemporary russian word for empire population much of russias expansion occurred in the 17th century culminating in the first russian colonization of the pacific in the mid-17th century the russo-polish war 165467 that incorporated left-bank ukraine and the russian conquest of siberia poland was divided in the 17901815 era with much of the land and population going to russia most of the 19th-century growth came from adding territory in asia south of siberia foreign relations eighteenth century peter the great 16721725 peter i the great 16721725 played a major role in introducing russia to the european state system while the vast land had a population of 14 million grain yields trailed behind those of agriculture in the west compelling nearly the entire population to farm only a small percentage lived in towns the class of kholops close in status to slavery remained a major institution in russia until 1723 when peter converted household kholops into house serfs thus including them in poll taxation russian agricultural kholops were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679 peters first military efforts were directed against the ottoman turks his attention then turned to the north peter still lacked a secure northern seaport except at archangel on the white sea where the harbor was frozen for nine months a year access to the baltic was blocked by sweden whose territory enclosed it on three sides peters ambitions for a window to the sea led him to make a secret alliance in 1699 with saxony the polishlithuanian commonwealth and denmark against sweden resulting in the great northern war the war ended in 1721 when an exhausted sweden asked for peace with russia peter acquired four provinces situated south and east of the gulf of finland the coveted access to the sea was now secured there he built russias new capital saint petersburg to replace moscow which had long been russias cultural center in 1722 he turned his aspirations as first russian monarch toward increasing russian influence in the caucasus and the caspian sea at the expense of the weakened safavid persians he made astrakhan the centre of military efforts against persia and waged the first full-scale war against them in 172223 peter reorganized his government based on the latest political models of the time moulding russia into an absolutist state he replaced the old boyar duma council of nobles with a nine-member senate in effect a supreme council of state the countryside was divided into new provinces and districts peter told the senate that its mission was to collect taxes and tax revenues tripled over the course of his reign as part of the government reform the orthodox church was partially incorporated into the countrys administrative structure in effect making it a tool of the state peter abolished the patriarchate and replaced it with a collective body the holy synod led by a government official meanwhile all vestiges of local self-government were removed peter continued and intensified his predecessors requirement of state service for all nobles peter died in 1725 leaving an unsettled succession after a short reign of his widow catherine i the crown passed to empress anna who slowed down the reforms and led a successful war against the ottoman empire which brought a significant weakening of the ottoman vassal crimean khanate a long-term russian adversary the discontent over the dominant positions of baltic germans in russian politics brought peter is daughter elizabeth on the russian throne elizabeth supported the arts architecture and the sciences for example with the foundation of the moscow university however she did not carry out significant structural reforms her reign which lasted nearly 20 years is also known for her involvement in the seven years war it was successful for russia militarily but fruitless politically catherine the great 17621796 catherine the great was a german princess who married peter iii the german heir to the russian crown after the death of empress elizabeth she came to power when her coup dtat against her unpopular husband succeeded she contributed to the resurgence of the russian nobility that began after the death of peter the great state service was abolished and catherine delighted the nobles further by turning over most state functions in the provinces to them catherine the great extended russian political control over the lands of the polishlithuanian commonwealth her actions included the support of the targowica confederation although the cost of her campaigns on top of the oppressive social system that required serfs to spend almost all of their time laboring on their owners land provoked a major peasant uprising in 1773 after catherine legalised the selling of serfs separate from land inspired by a cossack named pugachev with the emphatic cry of hang all the landlords the rebels threatened to take moscow before they were ruthlessly suppressed instead of the traditional punishment of being drawn and quartered catherine issued secret instructions that the executioner should carry the sentence out quickly and with a minimum of suffering as part of her effort to introduce compassion into the law she also ordered the public trial of darya nikolayevna saltykova a member of the highest nobility on charges of torture and murder these gestures of compassion garnered catherine much positive attention from europe experiencing the enlightenment age but the specter of revolution and disorder continued to haunt her and her successors in order to ensure continued support from the nobility which was essential to the survival of her government catherine was obliged to strengthen their authority and power at the expense of the serfs and other lower classes nevertheless catherine realized that serfdom must be ended going so far in her nakaz instruction to say that serfs were just as good as we are a comment the nobility received with disgust catherine successfully waged war against the ottoman empire and advanced russias southern boundary to the black sea then by plotting with the rulers of austria and prussia she incorporated territories of the polishlithuanian commonwealth during the partitions of poland pushing the russian frontier westward into central europe in accordance with the treaty russia had signed with the georgians to protect them against any new invasion of their persian suzerains and further political aspirations catherine waged a new war against persia in 1796 after they had again invaded georgia and established rule over it about a year prior and expelled the newly established russian garrisons in the caucasus by the time of her death in 1796 catherines expansionist policy had turned russia into a major european power this continued with alexander is wresting of finland from the weakened kingdom of sweden in 1809 and of bessarabia from the principality of moldavia ceded by the ottomans in 1812 state budget russia was in a continuous state of financial crisis while revenue rose from 9 million rubles in 1724 to 40 million in 1794 expenses grew more rapidly reaching 49 million in 1794 the budget allocated 46 percent to the military 20 percent to government economic activities 12 percent to administration and nine percent for the imperial court in st petersburg the deficit required borrowing primarily from amsterdam five percent of the budget was allocated to debt payments paper money was issued to pay for expensive wars thus causing inflation for its spending russia obtained a large and well-equipped army a very large and complex bureaucracy and a court that rivaled paris and london however the government was living far beyond its means and 18th-century russia remained a poor backward overwhelmingly agricultural and illiterate country first half of the nineteenth century emperor napoleon following a dispute with tsar alexander i launched an invasion of russia in 1812 the campaign was a catastrophe although napoleons grande arme made its way to moscow the russians scorched earth strategy prevented the invaders from living off the country in the bitter russian winter thousands of french troops were ambushed and killed by peasant guerrilla fighters as napoleons forces retreated the russian troops pursued them into central and western europe and to the gates of paris after russia and its allies defeated napoleon alexander became known as the saviour of europe and he presided over the redrawing of the map of europe at the congress of vienna 1815 that ultimately made alexander the monarch of congress poland although the russian empire would play a leading political role in the next century thanks to its defeat of napoleonic france its retention of serfdom precluded economic progress of any significant degree as western european economic growth accelerated during the industrial revolution russia began to lag ever farther behind creating new weaknesses for the empire seeking to play a role as a great power this status concealed the inefficiency of its government the isolation of its people and its economic backwardness following the defeat of napoleon alexander i had been ready to discuss constitutional reforms but though a few were introduced no major changes were attempted the liberal tsar was replaced by his younger brother nicholas i 18251855 who at the beginning of his reign was confronted with an uprising the background of this revolt lay in the napoleonic wars when a number of well-educated russian officers travelled in europe in the course of military campaigns where their exposure to the liberalism of western europe encouraged them to seek change on their return to autocratic russia the result was the decembrist revolt december 1825 the work of a small circle of liberal nobles and army officers who wanted to install nicholas brother as a constitutional monarch but the revolt was easily crushed leading nicholas to turn away from the modernization program begun by peter the great and champion the doctrine of orthodoxy autocracy and nationality the retaliation for the revolt made december fourteenth a day long remembered by later revolutionary movements in order to repress further revolts censorship was intensified including the constant surveillance of schools and universities textbooks were strictly regulated by the government police spies were planted everywhere would-be revolutionaries were sent off to siberia under nicholas i hundreds of thousands were sent to katorga there after the russian armies liberated allied since the 1783 treaty of georgievsk georgia from the qajar dynastys occupation in 1802 in the russo-persian war 180413 they clashed with persia over control and consolidation over georgia and also got involved in the caucasian war against the caucasian imamate the conclusion of the 18041813 war with persia made it irrevocably cede what is now dagestan georgia and most of azerbaijan to russia following the treaty of gulistan to the south west russia attempted to expand at the expense of the ottoman empire using recently acquired georgia at its base for the caucasus and anatolian front the late 1820s were successful military years despite losing almost all recently consolidated territories in the first year of the russo-persian war of 182628 russia managed to bring an end to the war with highly favourable terms with the treaty of turkmenchay including the official gains of what is now armenia azerbaijan and idr province in the 182829 russo-turkish war russia invaded northeastern anatolia and occupied the strategic ottoman towns of erzurum and gmhane and posing as protector and saviour of the greek orthodox population received extensive support from the regions pontic greeks following a brief occupation the russian imperial army withdrew back into georgia the question of russias direction had been gaining attention ever since peter the greats program of modernization some favored imitating western europe while others were against this and called for a return to the traditions of the past the latter path was advocated by slavophiles who held the decadent west in contempt the slavophiles were opponents of bureaucracy who preferred the collectivism of the medieval russian obshchina or mir over the individualism of the west more extreme social doctrines were elaborated by such russian radicals on the left as alexander herzen mikhail bakunin and peter kropotkin russian tsars crushed two uprisings in their newly acquired polish territories the november uprising in 1830 and the january uprising in 1863 the russian autocracy gave the polish artisans and gentry reason to rebel in 1863 by assailing national core values of language religion culture the result was the january uprising a massive polish revolt which was crushed by massive force france britain and austria tried to intervene in the crisis but were unable to do so the russian patriotic press used the polish uprising to unify the russian nation claiming it was russias god-given mission to save poland and the world poland was punished by losing its distinctive political and judicial rights with russianization imposed on its schools and courts second half of the nineteenth century in 185455 russia lost to britain france and turkey in the crimean war which was fought primarily in the crimean peninsula and to a lesser extent in the baltic since playing a major role in the defeat of napoleon russia had been regarded as militarily invincible but against a coalition of the great powers of europe the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed the decay and weakness of tsar nicholas regime when tsar alexander ii ascended the throne in 1855 desire for reform was widespread a growing humanitarian movement attacked serfdom as inefficient in 1859 there were more than 23 million serfs in usually poor living conditions alexander ii decided to abolish serfdom from above with ample provision for the landowners rather than wait for it to be abolished from below in a revolutionary way that would hurt the landowners the emancipation reform of 1861 that freed the serfs was the single most important event in 19th-century russian history and the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracys monopoly of power further reforms of 1860s included socio-economic reforms to clarify the position of the russian government in the field of property rights and their protection emancipation brought a supply of free labour to the cities stimulating industry and the middle class grew in number and influence however instead of receiving their lands as a gift the freed peasants had to pay a special tax for what amounted to their lifetime to the government which in turn paid the landlords a generous price for the land that they had lost in numerous cases the peasants ended up with the smallest amount of land all the property turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the mir the village community which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings although serfdom was abolished since its abolition was achieved on terms unfavourable to the peasants revolutionary tensions were not abated despite alexander iis intentions revolutionaries believed that the newly freed serfs were merely being sold into wage slavery in the onset of the industrial revolution and that the bourgeoisie had effectively replaced landowners alexander ii obtained outer manchuria from the qing china between 18581860 and sold the last territories of russian america alaska to the united states in 1867 in the late 1870s russia and the ottoman empire again clashed in the balkans from 1875 to 1877 the balkan crisis intensified with rebellions against ottoman rule by various slavic nationalities which the ottoman turks dominated since the 16th century this was seen as a political risk in russia which similarly suppressed its muslims in central asia and caucasia russian nationalist opinion became a major domestic factor in its support for liberating balkan christians from ottoman rule and making bulgaria and serbia independent in early 1877 russia intervened on behalf of serbian and russian volunteer forces in the russo-turkish war 187778 within one year russian troops were nearing istanbul and the ottomans surrendered russias nationalist diplomats and generals persuaded alexander ii to force the ottomans to sign the treaty of san stefano in march 1878 creating an enlarged independent bulgaria that stretched into the southwestern balkans when britain threatened to declare war over the terms of the treaty of san stefano an exhausted russia backed down at the congress of berlin in july 1878 russia agreed to the creation of a smaller bulgaria as an autonomous principality inside the ottoman empire as a result pan-slavists were left with a legacy of bitterness against austria-hungary and germany for failing to back russia disappointment at the results of the war stimulated revolutionary tensions and helped serbia romania and montenegro to gain independence from and strengthen themselves against the ottomans another significant result of the 187778 russo-turkish war in russias favour was the acquisition from the ottomans of the provinces of batum ardahan and kars in transcaucasia which were transformed into the militarily administered regions of batum oblast and kars oblast to replace muslim refugees who had fled across the new frontier into ottoman territory the russian authorities settled large numbers of christians from an ethnically diverse range of communities in kars oblast particularly the georgians caucasus greeks and armenians each of whom hoped to achieve protection and advance their own regional ambitions on the back of the russian empire alexander iii in 1881 alexander ii was assassinated by the narodnaya volya a nihilist terrorist organization the throne passed to alexander iii 18811894 a reactionary who revived the maxim of orthodoxy autocracy and nationality of nicholas i a committed slavophile alexander iii believed that russia could be saved from turmoil only by shutting itself off from the subversive influences of western europe during his reign russia declared the franco-russian alliance to contain the growing power of germany completed the conquest of central asia and demanded important territorial and commercial concessions from the qing the tsars most influential adviser was konstantin pobedonostsev tutor to alexander iii and his son nicholas and procurator of the holy synod from 1880 to 1895 he taught his royal pupils to fear freedom of speech and press as well as disliking democracy constitutions and the parliamentary system under pobedonostsev revolutionaries were persecuted and a policy of russification was carried out throughout the empire the movement south toward afghanistan and india alarmed the british who ignored russias quest for a warm-water port and worked to block its advance in what observers called the great game both nations avoided escalating the tensions into a war and they became allies in 1907 early twentieth century in 1894 alexander iii was succeeded by his son nicholas ii who was committed to retaining the autocracy that his father had left him nicholas ii proved ineffective as a ruler and in the end his dynasty was overthrown by revolution the industrial revolution began to show significant influence in russia but the country remained rural and poor the liberal elements among industrial capitalists and nobility believed in peaceful social reform and a constitutional monarchy forming the constitutional democratic party or kadets on the left the socialist revolutionary party srs incorporated the narodnik tradition and advocated the distribution of land among those who actually worked it the peasants another radical group was the russian social democratic labour party exponents of marxism in russia the social democrats differed from the srs in that they believed a revolution must rely on urban workers not the peasantry in 1903 at the 2nd congress of the russian social democratic labour party in london the party split into two wings the gradualist mensheviks and the more radical bolsheviks the mensheviks believed that the russian working class was insufficiently developed and that socialism could be achieved only after a period of bourgeois democratic rule they thus tended to ally themselves with the forces of bourgeois liberalism the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin supported the idea of forming a small elite of professional revolutionists subject to strong party discipline to act as the vanguard of the proletariat in order to seize power by force defeat in the russo-japanese war 19041905 was a major blow to the tsarist regime and further increased the potential for unrest in january 1905 an incident known as bloody sunday occurred when father georgy gapon led an enormous crowd to the winter palace in saint petersburg to present a petition to the tsar when the procession reached the palace soldiers opened fire on the crowd killing hundreds the russian masses were so furious over the massacre that a general strike was declared demanding a democratic republic this marked the beginning of the revolution of 1905 soviets councils of workers appeared in most cities to direct revolutionary activity russia was paralyzed and the government was desperate in october 1905 nicholas reluctantly issued the october manifesto which conceded the creation of a national duma legislature to be called without delay the right to vote was extended and no law was to become final without confirmation by the duma the moderate groups were satisfied but the socialists rejected the concessions as insufficient and tried to organise new strikes by the end of 1905 there was disunity among the reformers and the tsars position was strengthened for the time being war revolution collapse tsar nicholas ii and his subjects entered world war i with enthusiasm and patriotism with the defense of russias fellow orthodox slavs the serbs as the main battle cry in august 1914 the russian army invaded germanys province of east prussia and occupied a significant portion of austrian-controlled galicia in support of the serbs and their allies the french and british in september 1914 in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austro-hungary in galicia in order to attack german-held silesia military reversals and shortages among the civilian population soon soured much of the population german control of the baltic sea and german-ottoman control of the black sea severed russia from most of its foreign supplies and potential markets by the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing food and fuel were in short supply casualties were increasing and inflation was mounting strikes rose among low-paid factory workers and there were reports that peasants who wanted reforms of land ownership were restless the tsar eventually decided to take personal command of the army and moved to the front leaving his wife the empress alexandra in charge in the capital the illness of her son alexei led her to trust the semi-literate siberian peasant grigori rasputin 18691916 who convinced the royal family that he possessed healing powers that would cure alexei he had gained enormous influence but did not shift any major decisions his assassination in late 1916 by a clique of nobles restored their honor but could not restore the tsars lost prestige the tsarist system was overthrown in the february revolution in 1917 the bolsheviks declared no annexations no indemnities and called on workers to accept their policies and demanded the end of the war on 3 march 1917 a strike was organized on a factory in the capital petrograd within a week nearly all the workers in the city were idle and street fighting broke out rabinowitch argues that the february 1917 revolution grew out of prewar political and economic instability technological backwardness and fundamental social divisions coupled with gross mismanagement of the war effort continuing military defeats domestic economic dislocation and outrageous scandals surrounding the monarchy swain says the first government to be formed after the february revolution of 1917 had with one exception been composed of liberals with his authority destroyed nicholas abdicated on 2 march 1917 the execution of the romanov family at the hands of bolsheviks followed in 1918 territory boundaries the administrative boundaries of european russia apart from finland and its portion of poland coincided approximately with the natural limits of the east-european plains in the north it met the arctic ocean novaya zemlya and the kolguyev and vaygach islands also belonged to it but the kara sea was referred to siberia to the east it had the asiatic territories of the empire siberia and the kyrgyz steppes from both of which it was separated by the ural mountains the ural river and the caspian sea the administrative boundary however partly extending into asia on the siberian slope of the urals to the south it had the black sea and caucasus being separated from the latter by the manych river depression which in post-pliocene times connected the sea of azov with the caspian the western boundary was purely conventional it crossed the kola peninsula from the varangerfjord to the gulf of bothnia thence it ran to the curonian lagoon in the southern baltic sea and thence to the mouth of the danube taking a great circular sweep to the west to embrace poland and separating russia from prussia austrian galicia and romania it is a special feature of russia that it has few free outlets to the open sea other than on the ice-bound shores of the arctic ocean the deep indentations of the gulfs of bothnia and finland were surrounded by what is ethnically finnish territory and it is only at the very head of the latter gulf that the russians had taken firm foothold by erecting their capital at the mouth of the neva river the gulf of riga and the baltic belong also to territory which was not inhabited by slavs but by baltic and finnic peoples and by germans the east coast of the black sea belonged to transcaucasia a great chain of mountains separating it from russia but even this sheet of water is an inland sea the only outlet of which the bosphorus was in foreign hands while the caspian an immense shallow lake mostly bordered by deserts possessed more importance as a link between russia and its asiatic settlements than as a channel for intercourse with other countries geography by the end of the 19th century the size of the empire was about 22400000 square kilometers 8600000sqmi or almost 16 of the earths landmass its only rival in size at the time was the british empire however at this time the majority of the population lived in european russia more than 100 different ethnic groups lived in the russian empire with ethnic russians composing about 45 of the population territorial development in addition to almost the entire territory of modern russia prior to 1917 the russian empire included most of dnieper ukraine belarus bessarabia the grand duchy of finland armenia azerbaijan georgia the central asian states of russian turkestan most of the baltic governorates as well as a significant portion of the kingdom of poland and ardahan artvin idr kars and northeastern part of erzurum provinces from the ottoman empire between 1742 and 1867 the russian-american company administered alaska as a colony the company also established settlements in hawaii including fort elizabeth 1817 and as far south in north america as fort ross colony established in 1812 in sonoma county california just north of san francisco both fort ross and the russian river in california got their names from russian settlers who had staked claims in a region claimed until 1821 by the spanish as part of new spain following the swedish defeat in the finnish war of 18081809 and the signing of the treaty of fredrikshamn on 17 september 1809 the eastern half of sweden the area that then became finland was incorporated into the russian empire as an autonomous grand duchy the tsar eventually ended up ruling finland as a semi-constitutional monarch through the governor-general of finland and a native-populated senate appointed by him the emperor never explicitly recognized finland as a constitutional state in its own right however although his finnish subjects came to consider the grand duchy as one in the aftermath of the russo-turkish war 180612 and the ensuing treaty of bucharest 1812 the eastern parts of the principality of moldavia an ottoman vassal state along with some areas formerly under direct ottoman rule came under the rule of the empire this area bessarabia was among the russian empires last territorial increments in europe at the congress of vienna 1815 russia gained sovereignty over congress poland which on paper was an autonomous kingdom in personal union with russia however this autonomy was eroded after an uprising in 1831 and was finally abolished in 1867 saint petersburg gradually extended and consolidated its control over the caucasus in the course of the 19th century at the expense of persia through the russo-persian wars of 180413 and 182628 and the respectively ensuing treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay as well as through the caucasian war 18171864 the russian empire expanded its influence and possessions in central asia especially in the later 19th century conquering much of russian turkestan in 1865 and continuing to add territory as late as 1885 newly discovered arctic islands became part of the russian empire as russian explorers found them the new siberian islands from the early 18th century severnaya zemlya emperor nicholas ii land first mapped and claimed as late as 1913 during world war i russia briefly occupied a small part of east prussia then part of germany a significant portion of austrian galicia and significant portions of ottoman armenia while the modern russian federation currently controls the kaliningrad oblast which comprised the northern part of east prussia this differs from the area captured by the empire in 1914 though there was some overlap gusev gumbinnen in german was the site of the initial russian victory imperial territories according to the 1st article of the organic law the russian empire was one indivisible state in addition the 26th article stated that with the imperial russian throne are indivisible the kingdom of poland and grand principality of finland relations with the grand principality of finland were also regulated by the 2nd article the grand principality of finland constituted an indivisible part of the russian state in its internal affairs governed by special regulations at the base of special laws and the law of 10 june 1910 between 1744 and 1867 the empire also controlled russian america with the exception of this territory modern-day alaska the russian empire was a contiguous mass of land spanning europe and asia in this it differed from contemporary colonial-style empires the result of this was that while the british and french colonial empires declined in the 20th century the russian empire kept a large portion of its territory first as the soviet union and later as part of present-day russia as well as the commonwealth of independent states furthermore the empire at times controlled concession territories notably the kwantung leased territory and the chinese eastern railway both conceded by qing china as well as a concession in tianjin see for these periods of extraterritorial control the empire of japanrussian empire relations in 1815 dr schffer a russian entrepreneur went to kauai and negotiated a treaty of protection with the islands governor kaumualii vassal of king kamehameha i of hawaii but the russian tsar refused to ratify the treaty see also orthodox church in hawaii and russian fort elizabeth in 1889 a russian adventurer nikolay ivanovitch achinov tried to establish a russian colony in africa sagallo situated on the gulf of tadjoura in present-day djibouti however this attempt angered the french who dispatched two gunboats against the colony after a brief resistance the colony surrendered and the russian settlers were deported to odessa government and administration from its initial creation until the 1905 revolution the russian empire was controlled by its tsaremperor as an absolute monarch under the system of tsarist autocracy after the revolution of 1905 russia developed a new type of government which became difficult to categorize in the almanach de gotha for 1910 russia was described as a constitutional monarchy under an autocratic tsar this contradiction in terms demonstrated the difficulty of precisely defining the system essentially transitional and meanwhile sui generis established in the russian empire after october 1905 before this date the fundamental laws of russia described the power of the emperor as autocratic and unlimited after october 1905 while the imperial style was still emperor and autocrat of all the russias the fundamental laws were remodeled by removing the word unlimited while the emperor retained many of his old prerogatives including an absolute veto over all legislation he equally agreed to the establishment of an elected parliament without whose consent no laws were to be enacted in russia not that the regime in russia had become in any true sense constitutional far less parliamentary but the unlimited autocracy had given place to a self-limited autocracy whether this autocracy was to be permanently limited by the new changes or only at the continuing discretion of the autocrat became a subject of heated controversy between conflicting parties in the state provisionally then the russian governmental system may perhaps be best defined as a limited monarchy under an autocratic emperor conservatism was the reigning ideology for most of the russian leadership albeit with some reformist activities from time to time the structure of conservative thought was based upon antirationalism of the intellectuals religiosity rooted in the russian orthodox church traditionalism rooted in the landed estates worked by serfs and militarism rooted in the army officer corps regarding irrationality russia avoided the full force of the european enlightenment which gave priority to rationalism preferring the romanticism of an idealized nation state that reflected the beliefs values and behavior of the distinctive people the distinctly liberal notion of progress was replaced by a conservative notion of modernization based on the incorporation of modern technology to serve the established system the promise of modernization in the service of autocracy frightened the socialist intellectual alexander herzen who warned of a russia governed by genghis khan with a telegraph tsaremperor peter the great changed his title from tsar in 1721 when he was declared emperor of all russia while later rulers did not discard this new title the ruler of russia was commonly known as tsar or tsaritsa until the imperial system was abolished during the february revolution of 1917 prior to the issuance of the october manifesto the tsar ruled as an absolute monarch subject to only two limitations on his authority both of which were intended to protect the existing system the emperor and his consort must both belong to the russian orthodox church and he must obey the laws of succession pauline laws established by paul i beyond this the power of the russian autocrat was virtually limitless on 17 october 1905 the situation changed the ruler voluntarily limited his legislative power by decreeing that no measure was to become law without the consent of the imperial duma a freely elected national assembly established by the organic law issued on 28 april 1906 however he retained the right to disband the newly established duma and he exercised this right more than once he also retained an absolute veto over all legislation and only he could initiate any changes to the organic law itself his ministers were responsible solely to him and not to the duma or any other authority which could question but not remove them thus while the tsars personal powers were limited in scope after 28 april 1906 it still remained formidable imperial council under russias revised fundamental law of 20 february 1906 the council of the empire was associated with the duma as a legislative upper house from this time the legislative power was exercised normally by the emperor only in concert with the two chambers the council of the empire or imperial council as reconstituted for this purpose consisted of 196 members of whom 98 were nominated by the emperor while 98 were elective the ministers also nominated were ex officio members of the elected members 3 were returned by the black clergy the monks 3 by the white clergy seculars 18 by the corporations of nobles 6 by the academy of sciences and the universities 6 by the chambers of commerce 6 by the industrial councils 34 by the governments having zemstvos 16 by those having no zemstvos and 6 by poland as a legislative body the powers of the council were coordinate with those of the duma in practice however it has seldom if ever initiated legislation state duma and the electoral system the duma of the empire or imperial duma gosudarstvennaya duma which formed the lower house of the russian parliament consisted since the ukaz of 2 june 1907 of 442 members elected by an exceedingly complicated process the membership was manipulated as to secure an overwhelming majority of the wealthy especially the landed classes and also for the representatives of the russian peoples at the expense of the subject nations each province of the empire except central asia returned a certain number of members added to these were those returned by several large cities the members of the duma were chosen by electoral colleges and these in their turn were elected in assemblies of the three classes landed proprietors citizens and peasants in these assemblies the wealthiest proprietors sat in person while the lesser proprietors were represented by delegates the urban population was divided into two categories according to taxable wealth and elected delegates directly to the college of the governorates the peasants were represented by delegates selected by the regional subdivisions called volosts workmen were treated in special manner with every industrial concern employing fifty hands or over electing one or more delegates to the electoral college in the college itself the voting for the duma was by secret ballot and a simple majority carried the day since the majority consisted of conservative elements the landowners and urban delegates the progressives had little chance of representation at all save for the curious provision that one member at least in each government was to be chosen from each of the five classes represented in the college that the duma had any radical elements was mainly due to the peculiar franchise enjoyed by the seven largest towns saint petersburg moscow kiev odessa riga and the polish cities of warsaw and d these elected their delegates to the duma directly and though their votes were divided on the basis of taxable property in such a way as to give the advantage to wealth each returned the same number of delegates council of ministers in 1905 a council of ministers sovyet ministrov was created under a minister president the first appearance of a prime minister in russia this council consists of all the ministers and of the heads of the principal administrations the ministries were as follows ministry of the imperial court ministry of foreign affairs ministry of war ministry of navy ministry of finance ministry of commerce and industry created in 1905 ministry of internal affairs including police health censorship and press posts and telegraphs foreign religions statistics ministry of agriculture and state assets ministry of ways of communications ministry of justice ministry of national enlightenment most holy synod the most holy synod established in 1721 was the supreme organ of government of the orthodox church in russia it was presided over by a lay procurator representing the emperor and consisted of the three metropolitans of moscow saint petersburg and kiev the archbishop of georgia and a number of bishops sitting in rotation senate the senate pravitelstvuyushchi senat ie directing or governing senate originally established during the government reform of peter i consisted of members nominated by the emperor its wide variety of functions were carried out by the different departments into which it was divided it was the supreme court of cassation an audit office a high court of justice for all political offences one of its departments fulfilled the functions of a heralds college it also had supreme jurisdiction in all disputes arising out of the administration of the empire notably differences between representatives of the central power and the elected organs of local self-government lastly it promulgated new laws a function which theoretically gave it a power akin to that of the supreme court of the united states of rejecting measures not in accordance with fundamental laws administrative divisions for administration russia was divided as of 1914 into 81 governorates guberniyas 20 oblasts and 1 okrug vassals and protectorates of the russian empire included the emirate of bukhara the khanate of khiva and after 1914 tuva uriankhai of these 11 governorates 17 oblasts and 1 okrug sakhalin belonged to asian russia of the rest 8 governorates were in finland 10 in poland european russia thus embraced 59 governorates and 1 oblast that of the don the don oblast was under the direct jurisdiction of the ministry of war the rest had each a governor and deputy-governor the latter presiding over the administrative council in addition there were governors-general generally placed over several governorates and armed with more extensive powers usually including the command of the troops within the limits of their jurisdiction in 1906 there were governors-general in finland warsaw vilna kiev moscow and riga the larger cities saint petersburg moscow odessa sevastopol kerch nikolayev rostov had an administrative system of their own independent of the governorates in these the chief of police acted as governor judicial system the judicial system of the russian empire existed from the mid-19th century was established by the tsar emancipator alexander ii by the statute of 20 november 1864 sudebny ustav this system based partly on english partly on french models was built up on certain broad principles the separation of judicial and administrative functions the independence of the judges and courts the publicity of trials and oral procedure and the equality of all classes before the law moreover a democratic element was introduced by the adoption of the jury system and so far as one order of tribunal was concerned the election of judges the establishment of a judicial system on these principles constituted a major change in the conception of the russian state which by placing the administration of justice outside the sphere of the executive power ceased to be a despotism this fact made the system especially obnoxious to the bureaucracy and during the latter years of alexander ii and the reign of alexander iii there was a piecemeal taking back of what had been given it was reserved for the third duma after the 1905 revolution to begin the reversal of this process the system established by the law of 1864 was significant in that it set up two wholly separate orders of tribunals each having their own courts of appeal and coming in contact only in the senate as the supreme court of cassation the first of these based on the english model are the courts of the elected justices of the peace with jurisdiction over petty causes whether civil or criminal the second based on the french model are the ordinary tribunals of nominated judges sitting with or without a jury to hear important cases local administration alongside the local organs of the central government in russia there are three classes of local elected bodies charged with administrative functions the peasant assemblies in the mir and the volost the zemstvos in the 34 governorates of russia the municipal dumas municipal dumas since 1870 the municipalities in european russia have had institutions like those of the zemstvos all owners of houses and tax-paying merchants artisans and workmen are enrolled on lists in a descending order according to their assessed wealth the total valuation is then divided into three equal parts representing three groups of electors very unequal in number each of which elects an equal number of delegates to the municipal duma the executive is in the hands of an elective mayor and an uprava which consists of several members elected by the duma under alexander iii however by laws promulgated in 1892 and 1894 the municipal dumas were subordinated to the governors in the same way as the zemstvos in 1894 municipal institutions with still more restricted powers were granted to several towns in siberia and in 1895 to some in caucasia baltic provinces the formerly swedish-controlled baltic provinces courland livonia and estonia were incorporated into the russian empire after the defeat of sweden in the great northern war under the treaty of nystad of 1721 the baltic german nobility retained considerable powers of self-government and numerous privileges in matters affecting education police and the administration of local justice after 167 years of german language administration and education laws were declared in 1888 and 1889 where the rights of the police and manorial justice were transferred from baltic german control to officials of the central government since about the same time a process of russification was being carried out in the same provinces in all departments of administration in the higher schools and in the imperial university of dorpat the name of which was altered to yuriev in 1893 district committees for the management of the peasants affairs similar to those in the purely russian governments were introduced into this part of the empire economy mining and heavy industry infrastructure railways the planning and building of the railway network after 1860 had far-reaching effects on the economy culture and ordinary life of russia the central authorities and the imperial elite made most of the key decisions but local elites set up a demand for rail linkages local nobles merchants and entrepreneurs imagined the future from locality mestnost to empire to promote their regional interests often they had to compete with other cities by envisioning their own role in a rail network they came to understand how important they were to the empires economy the russian army built two major railway lines in central asia during the 1880s the trans-caucasian railway connected the city of batum on the black sea and the oil center of baku on the caspian sea the trans-caspian railway began at krasnovodsk on the caspian sea and reached bukhara samarkand and tashkent both lines served the commercial and strategic needs of the empire and facilitated migration tzarskoselskaya railway 1830 tzarskoselskaya railway 1830 map of russian railroads in 1916 map of russian railroads in 1916 seaports religion the russian empires state religion was orthodox christianity the emperor was not allowed to profess any faith other than the orthodox article 62 of the 1906 fundamental laws and was deemed the supreme defender and guardian of the dogmas of the predominant faith and is the keeper of the purity of the faith and all good order within the holy church article 64 ex supra although he made and annulled all senior ecclesiastical appointments he did not determine the questions of dogma or church teaching the principal ecclesiastical authority of the russian church that extended its jurisdiction over the entire territory of the empire including the ex-kingdom of kartli-kakheti was the most holy synod the civilian over procurator of the holy synod being one of the council of ministers with wide de facto powers in ecclesiastical matters all religions were freely professed except that certain restrictions were laid upon the jews and some marginal sects according to returns published in 1905 based on the russian imperial census of 1897 adherents of the different religious communities in the whole of the russian empire numbered approximately as follows the ecclesiastical heads of the national russian orthodox church consisted of three metropolitans saint petersburg moscow kiev fourteen archbishops and fifty bishops all drawn from the ranks of the monastic celibate clergy the parochial clergy had to be married when appointed but if left widowers were not allowed to marry again this rule continues to apply today military the russian empires military consisted of the imperial russian army and the imperial russian navy the poor performance during the crimean war 185356 caused great soul-searching and proposals for reform however the russian forces fell further and further behind the technology training and organization of the german french and particularly the british military the army performed poorly in world war i and became a center of unrest the events of the revolution and the fierce political struggles inside army unites facilitated disintegration and made it irreversible society the russian empire was predominantly a rural society spread over vast spaces in 1913 80 of the people were peasants soviet historiography proclaimed that the russian empire of the 19th century was characterized by systemic crisis which impoverished the workers and peasants and culminated in the revolutions of the early 20th century recent research by russian scholars disputes this interpretation mironov assesses the effects of the reforms of latter 19th-century especially in terms of the 1861 emancipation of the serfs agricultural output trends various standard of living indicators and taxation of peasants he argues that they brought about measurable improvements in social welfare more generally he finds that the well-being of the russian people declined during most of the 18th century but increased slowly from the end of the 18th century to 1914 estates subjects of the russian empire were segregated into sosloviyes or social estates classes such as nobility dvoryanstvo clergy merchants cossacks and peasants native people of the caucasus non-ethnic russian areas such as tartarstan bashkirstan siberia and central asia were officially registered as a category called inorodtsy non-slavic literally people of another origin a majority of the people 816 belonged to the peasant order the others were nobility 06 clergy 01 the burghers and merchants 93 and military 61 more than 88 million of the russians were peasants a part of them were formerly serfs 10447149 males in 1858 the remainder being state peasants 9194891 males in 1858 exclusive of the archangel governorate and domain peasants 842740 males the same year serfdom the serfdom that had developed in russia in the 16th century and had become enshrined by law in 1649 was abolished in 1861 the household servants or dependents attached to the personal service were merely set free while the landed peasants received their houses and orchards and allotments of arable land these allotments were given over to the rural commune the mir which was made responsible for the payment of taxes for the allotments for these allotments the peasants had to pay a fixed rent which could be fulfilled by personal labour the allotments could be redeemed by peasants with the help of the crown and then they were freed from all obligations to the landlord the crown paid the landlord and the peasants had to repay the crown for forty-nine years at 6 interest the financial redemption to the landlord was not calculated on the value of the allotments but was considered as a compensation for the loss of the compulsory labour of the serfs many proprietors contrived to curtail the allotments which the peasants had occupied under serfdom and frequently deprived them of precisely the parts of which they were most in need pasture lands around their houses the result was to compel the peasants to rent land from their former masters peasants the former serfs became peasants joining the millions of farmers who were already in the peasant status after the emancipation reform one quarter of peasants received allotments of only 29 acres 12000m per male and one-half less than 85 to 114 acres the normal size of the allotment necessary for the subsistence of a family under the three-fields system is estimated at 28 to 42 acres 170000m land must thus of necessity be rented from the landlords the aggregate value of the redemption and land taxes often reached 185 to 275 of the normal rental value of the allotments not to speak of taxes for recruiting purposes the church roads local administration and so on chiefly levied from the peasants the areas increased every year one-fifth of the inhabitants left their houses cattle disappeared every year more than half the adult males in some districts three-quarters of the men and one-third of the women quit their homes and wandered throughout russia in search of labor in the governments of the black earth area the state of matters was hardly better many peasants took gratuitous allotments whose amount was about one-eighth of the normal allotments the average allotment in kherson was only 090-acre 3600m and for allotments from 29 to 58 acres 23000m the peasants pay 5 to 10 rubles of redemption tax the state peasants were better off but still they were emigrating in masses it was only in the steppe governments that the situation was more hopeful in ukraine where the allotments were personal the mir existing only among state peasants the state of affairs does not differ for the better on account of the high redemption taxes in the western provinces where the land was valued cheaper and the allotments somewhat increased after the polish insurrection the general situation was better finally in the baltic provinces nearly all the land belonged to the german landlords who either farmed the land themselves with hired laborers or let it in small farms only one quarter of the peasants were farmers the remainder were mere laborers landowners the situation of the former serf-proprietors was also unsatisfactory accustomed to the use of compulsory labor they failed to adapt to the new conditions the millions of rubles of redemption money received from the crown was spent without any real or lasting agricultural improvements having been effected the forests were sold and the only prosperous landlords were those who exacted rack-rents for the land without which the peasants could not live upon their allotments during the years 1861 to 1892 the land owned by the nobles decreased 30 or from 210000000 to 150000000 acres 610000km during the following four years an additional 2119500 acres 8577km were sold and since then the sales went on at an accelerated rate until in 1903 alone close to 2000000 acres 8000km passed out of their hands on the other hand since 1861 and more especially since 1882 when the peasant land bank was founded for making advances to peasants who were desirous of purchasing land the former serfs or rather their descendants had between 1883 and 1904 bought about 19500000 acres 78900km from their former masters there was an increase of wealth among the few but along with this a general impoverishment of the mass of the people and the peculiar institution of the mirframed on the principle of community of ownership and occupation of the land-- the effect was not conducive to the growth of individual effort in november 1906 however the emperor nicholas ii promulgated a provisional order permitting the peasants to become freeholders of allotments made at the time of emancipation all redemption dues being remitted this measure which was endorsed by the third duma in an act passed on 21 december 1908 is calculated to have far-reaching and profound effects on the rural economy of russia thirteen years previously the government had endeavored to secure greater fixity and permanence of tenure by providing that at least twelve years must elapse between every two redistributions of the land belonging to a mir amongst those entitled to share in it the order of november 1906 had provided that the various strips of land held by each peasant should be merged into a single holding the duma however on the advice of the government left this to the future as an ideal that could only gradually be realized media censorship was heavy-handed until the reign of alexander ii but it never went away newspapers were strictly limited in what they could publish as intellectuals favored literary magazines for their publishing outlets fyodor dostoyevsky for example ridiculed the st petersburg newspapers such as golos and peterburgskii listok which he accused of publishing trifles and distracting readers from the pressing social concerns of contemporary russia through their obsession with spectacle and european popular culture education educational standards were very low in the russian empire by 1800 the level of literacy among male peasants ranged from 1 to 12 percent and 20 to 25 percent for urban men literacy among women was very low the rates were highest for the 84 to 87 percent merchants over 75 percent then the workers and peasants serfs were the least literate in every group women were far less literate than men by contrast in western europe urban men had about a 50 percent literacy rate the orthodox hierarchy was suspicious of education they saw no religious need whatever for literacy peasants had no use for literacy and people who did such as artisans businessmen and professionals were few in numberas late as 1851 only 8 of russians lived in cities the accession in 1801 of alexander i 18011825 was widely welcomed as an opening to fresh liberal ideas from the european enlightenment many reforms were promised but few were actually carried out before 1820 when he turned his attention to foreign affairs and personal religion and ignored reform issues in sharp contrast to western europe the entire empire had a very small bureaucracy about 17000 public officials most of whom lived in moscow or st petersburg modernization of government required much larger numbers but that in turn required an educational system that could provide suitable training russia lacked that and for university education young men went to western europe the army and the church had its own training programs narrowly focused on their particular needs the most important successful reform under alexander i came in the setting up a national system of education the ministry of education was set up in 1802 and the country was divided into six educational regions the long-term plan was for a university in every region a secondary school in every major city upgraded primary schoolsand for the largest number of students a parish school for every two parishes by 1825 the national government operated six universities forty-eight secondary state schools and 337 improved primary schools highly qualified teachers arrived from exile in france where they fled the revolution exiled jesuits set up elite boarding schools until their order was expelled in 1815 at the highest level universities were set up on the german model in kazan kharkov st petersburg vilna and dorpat while the relatively young imperial moscow university was expanded the higher forms of education were reserved for a very small elite with only a few hundred students at the universities by 1825 and 5500 in the secondary schools there were no schools open to girls most rich families still depended on private tutors t tsar nicholas i was a reactionary who wanted to neutralize foreign ideas especially those he ridiculed as pseudo-knowledge nevertheless his minister of education sergey uvarov at the university level was able to promote more academic freedom for the faculty who were under suspicion by reactionary church officials he raised academic standards improved facilities and opened the admission doors a bit wider nicholas tolerated uvarovs achievements until 1848 then reversed his innovations for the rest of the century the national government continue to focus on universities and generally ignore elementary and secondary educational needs by 1900 there were 17000 university students and over 30000 were enrolled in specialized technical institutes the students were conspicuous in moscow and st petersburg as a political force typically at the forefront of demonstrations and disturbances see also history portal
