cosmic background radiation is electromagnetic radiation from the big bang the origin of this radiation depends on the region of the spectrum that is observed one component is the cosmic microwave background this component is redshifted photons that have freely streamed from an epoch when the universe became transparent for the first time to radiation its discovery and detailed observations of its properties are considered one of the major confirmations of the big bang the discovery by chance in 1965 of the cosmic background radiation suggests that the early universe was dominated by a radiation field a field of extremely high temperature and pressure the sunyaevzeldovich effect shows the phenomena of radiant cosmic background radiation interacting with electron clouds distorting the spectrum of the radiation there is also background radiation in the infrared x-rays etc with different causes and they can sometimes be resolved into an individual source see cosmic infrared background and x-ray background see also cosmic neutrino background and extragalactic background light timeline of significant events 1896 charles douard guillaume estimates the radiation of the stars to be 56k 1926 sir arthur eddington estimates the non-thermal radiation of starlight in the galaxy has an effective temperature of 32k 1 1930s erich regener calculates that the non-thermal spectrum of cosmic rays in the galaxy has an effective temperature of 28k 1931 the term microwave first appears in print when trials with wavelengths as low as 18cm were made known there was undisguised surprise that the problem of the micro-wave had been solved so soon telegraph telephone journal xvii 1791 1938 nobel prize winner 1920 walther nernst re-estimates the cosmic ray temperature as 075k 1946 the term microwave is first used in print in an astronomical context in an article microwave radiation from the sun and moon by robert dicke and robert beringer 1946 robert dicke predicts a microwave background radiation temperature of 20k ref helge kragh 1946 robert dicke predicts a microwave background radiation temperature of less that 20k but later revised to 45k ref stephen g brush 1946 george gamow estimates a temperature of 50k 1948 ralph alpher and robert herman re-estimate gamows estimate at 5k 1949 ralph alpher and robert herman re-re-estimate gamows estimate at 28k 1960s robert dicke re-estimates a mbr microwave background radiation temperature of 40k ref helge kragh 1965 arno penzias and robert woodrow wilson measure the temperature to be approximately 3k robert dicke p j e peebles p g roll and d t wilkinson interpret this radiation as a signature of the big bang see also physics portal cosmology portal space portal hot dark matter irradiation the diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray background deep fields
