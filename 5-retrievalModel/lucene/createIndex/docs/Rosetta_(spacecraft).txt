rosetta was a space probe built by the european space agency launched on 2 march 2004 along with philae its lander module rosetta performed a detailed study of comet 67pchuryumovgerasimenko 67p during its journey to the comet the spacecraft flew by mars and the asteroids 21 lutetia and 2867 teins it was launched as the third cornerstone mission of the esas horizon 2000 programme after soho cluster and xmm-newton on 6 august 2014 the spacecraft reached the comet and performed a series of manoeuvres to eventually orbit the comet at distances of 30 to 10 kilometres 19 to 6mi on 12 november its lander module philae performed the first successful landing on a comet though its battery power ran out two days later communications with philae were briefly restored in june and july 2015 but due to diminishing solar power rosettas communications module with the lander was turned off on 27 july 2016 on 30 september 2016 the rosetta spacecraft ended its mission by hard-landing on the comet in its maat region the probe was named after the rosetta stone a stele of egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts the lander was named after the philae obelisk which bears a bilingual greek and egyptian hieroglyphic inscription mission overview rosetta was launched on 2 march 2004 from the guiana space centre in french guiana on an ariane 5 rocket and reached comet churyumovgerasimenko on 7 may 2014 it performed a series of manoeuvres to enter orbit between then and 6 august 2014 when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets it was one of esas horizon 2000 cornerstone missions the spacecraft consisted of the rosetta orbiter which featured 12 instruments and the philae lander with nine additional instruments the rosetta mission orbited comet churyumovgerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted the spacecraft was controlled from the european space operations centre esoc in darmstadt germany the planning for the operation of the scientific payload together with the data retrieval calibration archiving and distribution was performed from the european space astronomy centre esac in villanueva de la caada near madrid spain it has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014 some 2000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity in 2007 rosetta made a mars gravity assist flyby on its way to comet churyumovgerasimenko the spacecraft also performed two asteroid flybys the craft completed its flyby of asteroid 2867 teins in september 2008 and of 21 lutetia in july 2010 later on 20 january 2014 rosetta was taken out of a 31-month hibernation mode as it approached comet churyumovgerasimenko rosettas philae lander successfully made the first soft landing on a comet nucleus when it touched down on comet churyumovgerasimenko on 12 november 2014 on 5 september 2016 esa announced that the lander was discovered by the narrow-angle camera aboard rosetta as the orbiter made a low 27km 17mi pass over the comet the lander sits on its side wedged into a dark crevice of the comet explaining the lack of electrical power to establish proper communication with the orbiter history background during the 1986 approach of halleys comet international space probes were sent to explore the comet most prominent among them being esas giotto after the probes returned valuable scientific information it became obvious that follow-ons were needed that would shed more light on cometary composition and answer new questions both esa and nasa started cooperatively developing new probes the nasa project was the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf mission the esa project was the follow-on comet nucleus sample return cnsr mission both missions were to share the mariner mark ii spacecraft design thus minimising costs in 1992 after nasa cancelled craf due to budgetary limitations esa decided to develop a craf-style project on its own by 1993 it was evident that the ambitious sample return mission was infeasible with the existing esa budget so the mission was redesigned and subsequently approved by the esa with the final flight plan resembling the cancelled craf mission an asteroid flyby followed by a comet rendezvous with in-situ examination including a lander after the spacecraft launch gerhard schwehm was named mission manager he retired in march 2014 the rosetta mission included generational team management this allowed mission continuity over the long period of the mission and for special knowledge to be maintained and passed on to future team members in particular several younger scientists were brought on as principal science investigators and regular training sessions were conducted naming the probe was named after the rosetta stone a stele of egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts the lander was named after the philae obelisk which bears a bilingual greek and egyptian hieroglyphic inscription a comparison of its hieroglyphs with those on the rosetta stone catalysed the deciphering of the egyptian writing system similarly it was hoped that these spacecraft would result in better understanding of comets and the early solar system in a more direct analogy to its namesake the rosetta spacecraft also carried a micro-etched pure nickel prototype of the rosetta disc donated by the long now foundation the disc was inscribed with 6500 pages of language translations mission firsts the rosetta mission achieved many historic firsts on its way to comet 67p rosetta passed through the main asteroid belt and made the first european close encounter with several of these primitive objects rosetta was the first spacecraft to fly close to jupiters orbit using solar cells as its main power source rosetta was the first spacecraft to orbit a comet nucleus and was the first spacecraft to fly alongside a comet as it headed towards the inner solar system it became the first spacecraft to examine at close proximity the activity of a frozen comet as it is warmed by the sun shortly after its arrival at 67p the rosetta orbiter dispatched the philae lander for the first controlled touchdown on a comet nucleus the robotic landers instruments obtained the first images from a comets surface and made the first in situ analysis of its composition design and construction the rosetta bus was a 282120m 926966ft central frame and aluminium honeycomb platform its total mass was approximately 3000kg 6600lb which included the 100kg 220lb philae lander and 165kg 364lb of science instruments the payload support module was mounted on top of the spacecraft and housed the scientific instruments while the bus support module was on the bottom and contained spacecraft support subsystems heaters placed around the spacecraft kept its systems warm while it was distant from the sun rosettas communications suite included a 22m 72ft steerable high-gain parabolic dish antenna a 08m 26ft fixed-position medium-gain antenna and two omnidirectional low-gain antennas electrical power for the spacecraft came from two solar arrays totalling 64 square metres 690sqft each solar array was subdivided into five solar panels with each panel being 2252736m 738898ft the individual solar cells were made of silicon 200 m thick and 61953775mm 244149in the solar arrays generated a maximum of approximately 1500 watts at perihelion a minimum of 400 watts in hibernation mode at 52 au and 850 watts when comet operations begin at 34 au spacecraft power was controlled by a redundant terma power module also used in the mars express spacecraft and was stored in four 10-ah nicd batteries supplying 28 volts to the bus main propulsion comprised 24 paired bipropellant 10n thrusters with four pairs of thrusters being used for delta-v burns the spacecraft carried 17191kg 3790lb of propellant at launch 6596kg 1454lb of monomethylhydrazine fuel and 10595kg 2336lb of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser contained in two 1108-litre 244impgal 293usgal grade 5 titanium alloy tanks and providing delta-v of at least 2300 metres per second 7500fts over the course of the mission propellant pressurisation was provided by two 68-litre 15impgal 18usgal high-pressure helium tanks rosetta was built in a clean room according to cospar rules but sterilisation was generally not crucial since comets are usually regarded as objects where you can find prebiotic molecules that is molecules that are precursors of life but not living microorganisms according to gerhard schwehm rosettas project scientist the total cost of the mission was about 13billion us18billion launch rosetta was set to be launched on 12 january 2003 to rendezvous with the comet 46pwirtanen in 2011 this plan was abandoned after the failure of an ariane 5 carrier rocket during hot bird 7s launch on 11 december 2002 grounding it until the cause of the failure could be determined in may 2003 a new plan was formed to target the comet 67pchuryumovgerasimenko with a revised launch date of 26 february 2004 and comet rendezvous in 2014 the larger mass and the resulting increased impact velocity made modification of the landing gear necessary after two scrubbed launch attempts rosetta was launched on 2 march 2004 at 0717utc from the guiana space centre in french guiana aside from the changes made to launch time and target the mission profile remained almost identical both co-discoverers of the comet klim churyumov and svetlana gerasimenko were present at the spaceport during the launch deep space manoeuvres to achieve the required velocity to rendezvous with 67p rosetta used gravity assist manoeuvres to accelerate throughout the inner solar system the comets orbit was known before rosettas launch from ground-based measurements to an accuracy of approximately 100km 62mi information gathered by the onboard cameras beginning at a distance of 24million kilometres 15000000mi were processed at esas operation centre to refine the position of the comet in its orbit to a few kilometres the first earth flyby was on 4 march 2005 on 25 february 2007 the craft was scheduled for a low-altitude flyby of mars to correct the trajectory this was not without risk as the estimated altitude of the flyby was a mere 250 kilometres 160mi during that encounter the solar panels could not be used since the craft was in the planets shadow where it would not receive any solar light for 15 minutes causing a dangerous shortage of power the craft was therefore put into standby mode with no possibility to communicate flying on batteries that were originally not designed for this task this mars manoeuvre was therefore nicknamed the billion euro gamble the flyby was successful with rosetta even returning detailed images of the surface and atmosphere of the planet and the mission continued as planned the second earth flyby was on 13 november 2007 at a distance of 5700km 3500mi in observations made on 7 and 8 november rosetta was briefly mistaken for a near-earth asteroid about 20m 66ft in diameter by an astronomer of the catalina sky survey and was given the provisional designation 2007 vn84 calculations showed that it would pass very close to earth which led to speculation that it could impact earth however astronomer denis denisenko recognised that the trajectory matched that of rosetta which the minor planet center confirmed in an editorial release on 9 november the spacecraft performed a close flyby of asteroid 2867 teins on 5 september 2008 its onboard cameras were used to fine-tune the trajectory achieving a minimum separation of less than 800km 500mi onboard instruments measured the asteroid from 4 august to 10 september maximum relative speed between the two objects during the flyby was 86kms 19000mph 31000kmh rosettas third and final flyby of earth happened on 12 november 2009 on 10 july 2010 rosetta flew by 21 lutetia a large main-belt asteroid at a minimum distance of 7003316800000000000316875km 7003196900000000000196947mi at a velocity of 15 kilometres per second 93mis the flyby provided images of up to 60 metres 200ft per pixel resolution and covered about 50 of the surface mostly in the northern hemisphere the 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and broad-band filters extending from 024 to 1m lutetia was also observed by the visiblenear-infrared imaging spectrometer virtis and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well after leaving its hibernation mode in january 2014 and getting closer to the comet rosetta began a series of eight burns in may 2014 these reduced the relative velocity between the spacecraft and 67p from 775ms 2540fts to 79ms 26fts reaction control system problems in 2006 rosetta suffered a leak in its reaction control system rcs the system which consists of 24 bipropellant 10-newton thrusters was responsible for fine tuning the trajectory of rosetta throughout its journey the rcs operated at a lower pressure than designed due to the leak while this may have caused the propellants to mix incompletely and burn dirtier and less efficiently esa engineers were confident that the spacecraft would have sufficient fuel reserves to allow for the successful completion of the mission prior to rosettas deep space hibernation period two of the spacecrafts four reaction wheels began exhibiting increased levels of bearing friction noise increased friction levels in reaction wheel assembly rwab were noted after its september 2008 encounter with asteroid teins two attempts were made to relubricate the rwa using an on-board oil reservoir but in each case noise levels were only temporarily lowered and the rwa was turned off in mid-2010 after the flyby of asteroid lutetia to avoid possible failure shortly after this rwac also began showing evidence of elevated friction relubrication was also performed on this rwa but methods were found to temporarily increase its operating temperature to better improve the transfer of oil from its reservoir in addition the reaction wheels speed range was decreased to limit lifetime accumulated rotations these changes resulted in rwacs performance stabilising during the spacecrafts deep space hibernation flight phase engineers performed ground testing on a flight spare rwa at the european space operations centre after rosetta exited hibernation in january 2014 lessons learned from the ground testing were applied to all four rwas such as increasing their operating temperatures and limiting their wheel speeds to below 1000rpm after these fixes the rwas showed nearly identical performance data three rwas were kept operational while one of the malfunctioning rwas was held in reserve additionally new on-board software was developed to allow rosetta to operate with only two active rwas if necessary these changes allowed the four rwas to operate throughout rosettas mission at 67pchuryumovgerasimenko despite occasional anomalies in their friction plots and a heavy workload imposed by numerous orbital changes orbit around 67p in august 2014 rosetta rendezvoused with the comet 67pchuryumovgerasimenko 67p and commenced a series of manoeuvres that took it on two successive triangular paths averaging 100 and 50 kilometres 62 and 31mi from the nucleus whose segments are hyperbolic escape trajectories alternating with thruster burns after closing to within about 30km 19mi from the comet on 10 september the spacecraft entered actual orbit about it the surface layout of 67p was unknown before rosettas arrival the orbiter mapped the comet in anticipation of detaching its lander by 25 august 2014 five potential landing sites had been determined on 15 september 2014 esa announced sitej named agilkia in honour of agilkia island by an esa public contest and located on the head of the comet as the landers destination philae lander philae detached from rosetta on 12 november 2014 at 0835 utc and approached 67p at a relative speed of about 1ms 36kmh 22mph it initially landed on 67p at 1533 utc but bounced twice coming to rest at 1733 utc confirmation of contact with 67p reached earth at 1603 utc on contact with the surface two harpoons were to be fired into the comet to prevent the lander from bouncing off as the comets escape velocity is only around 1ms 36kmh 22mph analysis of telemetry indicated that the surface at the initial touchdown site is relatively soft covered with a layer of granular material about 082 feet 025 meters deep and that the harpoons had not fired upon landing after landing on the comet philae had been scheduled to commence its science mission which included characterisation of the nucleus determination of the chemical compounds present including amino acid enantiomers study of comet activities and developments over time after bouncing philae settled in the shadow of a cliff canted at an angle of around 30 degrees this made it unable to adequately collect solar power and it lost contact with rosetta when its batteries ran out after two days well before much of the planned science objectives could be attempted contact was briefly and intermittently reestablished several months later at various times between 13 june and 9 july before contact was lost once again there was no communication afterwards and the transmitter to communicate with philae was switched off in july 2016 to reduce power consumption of the probe the precise location of the lander was discovered in september 2016 when rosetta came closer to the comet and took high-resolution pictures of its surface knowing its exact location provides information needed to put philaes two days of science into proper context notable results researchers expect the study of data gathered will continue for decades to come one of the first discoveries was that the magnetic field of 67p oscillated at 4050 millihertz a german composer and sound designer created an artistic rendition from the measured data to make it audible although it is a natural phenomenon it has been described as a song and has been compared to continuum for harpsichord by gyrgy ligeti however results from philaes landing show that the comets nucleus has no magnetic field and that the field originally detected by rosetta is likely caused by the solar wind the isotopic signature of water vapour from comet 67p as determined by the rosetta spacecraft is substantially different from that found on earth that is the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water from the comet was determined to be three times that found for terrestrial water this makes it very unlikely that water found on earth came from comets such as comet 67p according to the scientists on 22 january 2015 nasa reported that between june and august 2014 the rate at which water vapour was released by the comet increased up to tenfold on 2 june 2015 nasa reported that the alice spectrograph on rosetta determined that electrons within 1km 06mi above the comet nucleus produced from photoionisation of water molecules by solar radiation and not photons from the sun as thought earlier are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma end of mission as the orbit of comet 67p took it farther from the sun the amount of sunlight reaching rosettas solar panels decreased while it would have been possible to put rosetta into a second hibernation phase during the comets aphelion there was no assurance that enough power would be available to run the spacecrafts heaters to keep it from freezing to guarantee a maximum science return mission managers made the decision to instead guide rosetta down to the comets surface and end the mission on impact gathering photographs and instrument readings along the way on 23 june 2015 at the same time as a mission extension was confirmed esa announced that end of mission would occur at the end of september 2016 after two years of operations at the comet rosetta began a 19km 12mi descent with a 208-second thruster burn executed on 29 september 2016 at approximately 2050utc its trajectory targeted a site in the maat region near an area of dust- and gas-producing active pits impact on the comets surface occurred 145 hours after its descent manoeuvre the final data packet from rosetta was transmitted at 103928895utc scet by the osiris instrument and was received at the european space operations centre in darmstadt germany at 111936541utc the spacecrafts estimated speed at the time of impact was 32kmh 20mph 89cms and its touchdown location named sais by the operations team after the rosetta stones original temple home is believed to be only 40m 130ft off-target the final complete image transmitted by the spacecraft of the comet was taken by its osiris instrument at an altitude of 233262m 7686ft about 10 seconds before impact showing an area 096m 31ft across rosettas computer included commands to send it into safe mode upon detecting that it had hit the comets surface turning off its radio transmitter and rendering it inert in accordance with international telecommunication union rules on 28 september 2017 a previously unrecovered image taken by the spacecraft was reported this image was recovered from three data packets discovered on a server after completion of the mission while blurry due to data loss it shows an area of the comets surface approximately one square meter in size taken from an altitude of 179210m 587689ft and represents rosettas closest image of the surface instruments nucleus the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers one microwave radio antenna and one radar alice an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph the ultraviolet spectrograph searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the detection was done by an array of potassium bromide and caesium iodide photocathodes the 31kg 68lb instrument used 29 watts and an improved version is currently being used in the new horizons spacecraft it operated in the extreme and far ultraviolet spectrum from 7002050 70205nm alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasas jet propulsion laboratory osiris optical spectroscopic and infrared remote imaging system the camera system had a narrow-angle lens 700mm and a wide-angle lens 140mm with a 20482048 pixel ccd chip the instrument was constructed in germany virtis visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the detection was done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for ir and with a ccd chip for the visible wavelength range the instrument was produced in italy and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter the abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by miro via their microwave emissions the 30cm 12in radio antenna along with the rest of the 185kg 41lb instrument was built by nasas jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions consert comet nucleus sounding experiment by radiowave transmission the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus this allowed it to determine the comets internal structure and deduce information on its composition the electronics were developed by france and both antennas were constructed in germany rsi radio science investigation rsi made use of the probes communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet gas and particles rosina rosetta orbiter spectrometer for ion and neutral analysis the instrument consisted of a double-focus magnetic mass spectrometer dfms and a reflectron type time of flight mass spectrometer rtof the dfms had a high resolution could resolve n2 from co for molecules up to 300 amu the rtof was highly sensitive for neutral molecules and for ions rosina was developed at the university of bern in switzerland midas micro-imaging dust analysis system the high-resolution atomic force microscope investigated several physical aspects of the dust particles which are deposited on a silicon plate cosima cometary secondary ion mass analyser cosima analysed the composition of dust particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry using indium ions it could detect ions up to a mass of 6500amu giada grain impact analyser and dust accumulator giada analysed the dust environment of the comet coma by measuring the optical cross section momentum speed and mass of each grain entering inside the instrument solar wind interaction rpc rosetta plasma consortium search for organic compounds previous observations have shown that comets contain complex organic compounds these are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids essential ingredients for life as we know it comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules rosetta and philae also searched for organic molecules nucleic acids the building blocks of dna and rna and amino acids the building blocks of proteins by sampling and analysing the comets nucleus and coma cloud of gas and dust helping assess the contribution comets made to the beginnings of life on earth before succumbing to falling power levels philaes cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comets atmosphere upon landing on the comet philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all left-handed which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule most asymmetrical molecules are oriented in approximately equal numbers of left- and right-handed configurations chirality and the primarily left-handed structure of essential amino acids used by living organisms is unique one hypothesis that will be tested was proposed in 1983 by william a bonner and edward rubenstein stanford university professors emeritus of chemistry and medicine respectively they conjectured that when spiralling radiation is generated from a supernova the circular polarisation of that radiation could then destroy one type of handed molecules the supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space where they could eventually end up on a planet preliminary results the mission has yielded a significant science return collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet the carbon in this organic material is bound in very large macromolecular compounds analogous to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites however no hydrated minerals were detected suggesting no link with carbonaceous chondrites in turn the philae landers cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comets atmosphere as it descended to its surface measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philaes lander revealed sixteen organic compounds four of which were seen for the first time on a comet including acetamide acetone methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde the only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine along with the precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen o 2 gas surrounding the comet timeline of major events and discoveries 2 march rosetta was successfully launched at 0717 utc 0417 local time from kourou french guiana 4 march rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by gravity assist passage of earth the moon and the earths magnetic field were used to test and calibrate the instruments on board of the spacecraft the minimum altitude above the earths surface was 19547km 12146mi 4 july imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet tempel 1 and the impactor of the deep impact mission 25 february mars flyby 8 november catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft approaching for its second earth flyby as a newly discovered asteroid 13 november second earth swing-by at a minimum altitude of 5295km 3290mi travelling at 45000kmh 28000mph 5 september flyby of asteroid 2867 teins the spacecraft passed the main-belt asteroid at a distance of 800km 500mi and the relatively slow speed of 86kms 31000kmh 19000mph 13 november third and final swing-by of earth at 48024kmh 29841mph 16 march observation of the dust tail of asteroid p2010 a2 together with observations by hubble space telescope it could be confirmed that p2010a2 is not a comet but an asteroid and that the tail most likely consists of particles from an impact by a smaller asteroid 10 july flew by and photographed the asteroid 21 lutetia may to july starting on 7 may rosetta began orbital correction manoeuvres to bring itself into orbit around 67p at the time of the first deceleration burn rosetta was approximately 2000000km 1200000mi away from 67p and had a relative velocity of 775ms 2540fts by the end of the last burn which occurred on 23 july the distance had been reduced to just over 4000km 2500mi with a relative velocity of 79ms 18mph in total eight burns were used to align the trajectories of rosetta 67p with the majority of the deceleration occurring during three burns delta-vs of 291ms 650mph on 21 may 271ms 610mph on 4 june and 91ms 200mph on 18 june 14 july the osiris on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67p which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet 6 august rosetta arrives at 67p approaching to 100km 62mi and carrying out a thruster burn that reduces its relative velocity to 1ms 33fts commences comet mapping and characterisation to determine a stable orbit and viable landing location for philae 4 september the first science data from rosettas alice instrument was reported showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comets surface water-ice was expected to be found as the comet is too far from the sun to turn water into vapour 10 september 2014 rosetta enters the global mapping phase orbiting 67p at an altitude of 29km 18mi 12 november 2014 philae lands on the surface of 67p 10 december 2014 data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth the ratio is regarded as a distinctive signature and the discovery means that earths water is unlikely to have originated from comets like 67p 14 april 2015 scientists report that the comets nucleus has no magnetic field of its own 2 july 2015 scientists report that active pits related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts have been found on the comet 11 august 2015 scientists release images of a comet outburst that occurred on 29 july 2015 28 october 2015 scientists publish an article in nature reporting high levels of molecular oxygen around 67p november 2014 to december 2015 rosetta escorted the comet around the sun and performed riskier investigations 27 july 2016 esa switched off the electrical support system processor unit ess aboard rosetta disabling any possibility of further communications with the philae lander 2 september 2016 - rosetta photographs the philae lander for the first time after its landing finding it wedged against a large overhang 30 september 2016 - mission ended in an attempt to slow land on the comets surface near a 130m 425ft wide pit called deir el-medina the walls of the pit contain 091m 3ft wide so-called goose bumps believed to represent the building blocks of the comet although philae sent back some data during its descent rosetta has more powerful and more varied sensors and instruments offering the opportunity to get some very close-in science to complement the more distant remote sensing it has been doing the orbiter descended more slowly than philae did public image once upon a time cartoon as part of the european space agencys media campaign in support of the rosetta mission both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time the series depicts various stages in the rosetta mission involving the personified rosetta and philae on a classic road trip story into the depths of our universe complimented with various visual gags presented in an educational context produced by animation studio design data gmbh the series was initially conceived by the esa as a four-part fantasy-like series with a sleeping beauty theme that promoted community involvement in rosettas wake up from hibernation in january 2014 after the success of the series however the esa commissioned the studio to continue producing new episodes in the series throughout the course of the mission a total of twelve videos in the series were produced from 2013 to 2016 with a 25-minute compilation of the series released in december 2016 after the end of the mission the characters featured in once upon a time designed by esa employee and cartoonist carlo palazzari became a central part of public image of the rosetta mission appearing in promotional material for the mission such as posters and merchandise and often credited as a major factor in the popularity of the mission among the public esa employees also role-played as the characters on twitter throughout the course of the mission the rosetta and philae characters were inspired by the jaxas kawaii characters whom portrayed a number of their spacecraft such as hayabusa2 and akatsuki with distinct anime-like personalities the script for each episode of the series is written by science communicators at the european space research and technology centre who kept close with mission operators and the producers at design data canonically rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings with rosetta being the older sister inspired by the spacecrafts feminine name of philae her younger brother the giotto spacecraft is also depicted as the duos grandfather whereas others in the halley armada as well as nasas deep impact and stardust spacecraft are depicted as their cousins ambition to promote the spacecrafts arrival at comet 67pchuryumovgerasimenko and the landing of philae in 2014 a short film was produced by the european space agency with polish visual effects production company platige image titled ambition the film shot in iceland stars irish actor aidan gillen known for his roles in game of thrones and the wire and irish actress aisling franciosi also of game of thrones fame and was directed by oscar-nominated polish director tomasz bagiski set in the far future ambition centers around a discussion between a master played by gillen discussing the importance of ambition with his apprentice played by franciosi using the rosetta mission as an
