an order of magnitude is an approximate measure of the number of digits that a number has in the commonly-used base-ten number system it is equal to the logarithm base 10 rounded to a whole number for example the order of magnitude of 1500 is 3 because 1500 1510 differences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in decades ie factors of ten examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at orders of magnitude numbers definition generally the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number to work out the order of magnitude of a number n displaystyle n the number is first expressed in the following form where 10 10 a 10 displaystyle frac sqrt 1010leq asqrt 10 then b displaystyle b represents the order of magnitude of the number the order of magnitude can be any integer the table below enumerates the order of magnitude of some numbers in light of this definition the geometric mean of 10 b displaystyle 10b and 10 b 1 displaystyle 10b1 is 10 10 b displaystyle sqrt 10times 10b meaning that a value of exactly 10 b displaystyle 10b ie a 1 displaystyle a1 represents a geometric halfway point within the range of possible values of a displaystyle a some use a simpler definition where 05 a 5 displaystyle 05aleq 5 perhaps because the arithmetic mean of 10 b displaystyle 10b and 10 b c displaystyle 10bc approaches 5 10 b c 1 displaystyle 5times 10bc-1 for increasing c displaystyle c this definition has the effect of lowering the values of b displaystyle b slightly yet others restrict a displaystyle a to values where 1 a 10 displaystyle 1leq a10 making the order of magnitude of a number exactly equal to its exponent part in scientific notation uses orders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons if numbers differ by one order of magnitude x is about ten times different in quantity than y if values differ by two orders of magnitude they differ by a factor of about 100 two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value calculating the order of magnitude the order of magnitude of a number is intuitively speaking the number of powers of 10 contained in the number more precisely the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the common logarithm usually as the integer part of the logarithm obtained by truncation for example the number 70064000000000000004000000 has a logarithm in base 10 of 6602 its order of magnitude is 6 when truncating a number of this order of magnitude is between 10 and 10 in a similar example with the phrase he had a seven-figure income the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6 an order of magnitude is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale order-of-magnitude estimate an order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten for example an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion such as the human population of the earth is 10 billion to round a number to its nearest order of magnitude one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer thus 70064000000000000004000000 which has a logarithm in base 10 of 6602 has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude because nearest implies rounding rather than truncation for a number written in scientific notation this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten about 3162 for example the nearest order of magnitude for 70081700000000000001710 is 8 whereas the nearest order of magnitude for 70083700000000000003710 is 9 an order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation order of magnitude difference an order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10 for example the mass of the planet saturn is 95 times that of earth so saturn is two orders of magnitude more massive than earth order-of-magnitude differences are called decades when measured on a logarithmic scale non-decimal orders of magnitude other orders of magnitude may be calculated using bases other than 10 the ancient greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred about 2512 as bright as the nearest weaker level of brightness and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is 100 or a factor of 100 times brighter the different decimal numeral systems of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number and have created names for the powers of this larger base the table shows what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base 70061000000000000001000000 it can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 these make sense in the long scale only and the suffix -illion tells that the base is 70061000000000000001000000 but the number names billion trillion themselves here with other meaning than in the first chapter are not names of the orders of magnitudes they are names of magnitudes that is the numbers 70121000000000000001000000000000 etc si units in the table at right are used together with si prefixes which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind the iec standard prefixes with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology the ancient apparent magnitudes for the brightness of stars uses the base 100 5 2512 displaystyle sqrt5100approx 2512 and is reversed the modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values extremely large numbers for extremely large numbers a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their double logarithm or super-logarithm rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very round numbers rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the nearest round number the double logarithm yields the categories the first two mentioned and the extension to the left may not be very useful they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left the super-logarithm yields the categories the midpoints which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case and depending on the interpolation method in the second case for extremely small numbers in the sense of close to zero neither method is suitable directly but the generalized order of magnitude of the reciprocal can be considered similar to the logarithmic scale one can have a double logarithmic scale example provided here and super-logarithmic scale the intervals above all have the same length on them with the midpoints actually midway more generally a point midway between two points corresponds to the generalised f-mean with fx the corresponding function log log x or slog x in the case of log log x this mean of two numbers eg 2 and 16 giving 4 does not depend on the base of the logarithm just like in the case of log x geometric mean 2 and 8 giving 4 but unlike in the case of log log log x 4 and 700465536000000000065536 giving 16 if the base is 2
