standard conditions for temperature and pressure are standard sets of conditions for experimental measurements to be established to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of data the most used standards are those of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the national institute of standards and technology nist although these are not universally accepted standards other organizations have established a variety of alternative definitions for their standard reference conditions in chemistry iupac changed the definition of standard temperature and pressure stp in 1982 until 1982 stp was defined as a temperature of 27315k 0c 32f and an absolute pressure of exactly 1atm 101325kpa since 1982 stp is defined as a temperature of 27315k 0c 32f and an absolute pressure of exactly 10pa 100kpa 1bar stp should not be confused with the standard state commonly used in thermodynamic evaluations of the gibbs energy of a reaction nist uses a temperature of 20c 29315k 68f and an absolute pressure of 1 atm 14696psi 101325kpa this standard is also called normal temperature and pressure abbreviated as ntp the international standard metric conditions for natural gas and similar fluids are 28815k 1500c 5900f and 101325 kpa in industry and commerce standard conditions for temperature and pressure are often necessary to define the standard reference conditions to express the volumes of gases and liquids and related quantities such as the rate of volumetric flow the volumes of gases vary significantly with temperature and pressure standard cubic meters per second sm3s and normal cubic meters per second nm3s however many technical publications books journals advertisements for equipment and machinery simply state standard conditions without specifying them often leading to confusion and errors good practice always incorporates the reference conditions of temperature and pressure definitions past uses before 1918 many professionals and scientists using the metric system of units defined the standard reference conditions of temperature and pressure for expressing gas volumes as being 15c 28815k 5900f and 101325kpa 100atm 760torr during those same years the most commonly used standard reference conditions for people using the imperial or us customary systems was 60f 1556c 28871k and 14696psi 1atm because it was almost universally used by the oil and gas industries worldwide the above definitions are no longer the most commonly used in either system of units current use many different definitions of standard reference conditions are currently being used by organizations all over the world the table below lists a few of them but there are more some of these organizations used other standards in the past for example iupac has since 1982 defined standard reference conditions as being 0c and 100kpa 1bar in contrast to its old standard of 0c and 101325kpa 1atm natural gas companies in europe australia and south america have adopted 15c 59f and 101325kpa 14696psi as their standard gas volume reference conditions used as the base values for defining the standard cubic meter also the international organization for standardization iso the united states environmental protection agency epa and national institute of standards and technology nist each have more than one definition of standard reference conditions in their various standards and regulations notes egia electricity and gas inspection act of canada satp standard ambient temperature and pressure scf standard cubic foot international standard atmosphere in aeronautics and fluid dynamics the international standard atmosphere isa is a specification of pressure temperature density and speed of sound at each altitude the international standard atmosphere is representative of atmospheric conditions at mid latitudes in the usa this information is specified the us standard atmosphere which is identical to the international standard atmosphere at all altitudes up to 65000 feet above sea level standard laboratory conditions due to the fact that many definitions of standard temperature and pressure differ in temperature significantly from standard laboratory temperatures eg 0c vs 25c reference is often made to standard laboratory conditions a term deliberately chosen to be different from the term standard conditions for temperature and pressure despite its semantic near identity when interpreted literally however what is a standard laboratory temperature and pressure is inevitably geography-bound given that different parts of the world differ in climate altitude and the degree of use of heatcooling in the workplace for example schools in new south wales australia use 25c at 100kpa for standard laboratory conditions astm international has published standard astm e41- terminology relating to conditioning and hundreds of special conditions for particular materials and test methods other standards organizations also have specialized standard test conditions molar volume of a gas it is equally as important to indicate the applicable reference conditions of temperature and pressure when stating the molar volume of a gas as it is when expressing a gas volume or volumetric flow rate stating the molar volume of a gas without indicating the reference conditions of temperature and pressure has very little meaning and can cause confusion the molar volume of gases around stp and at atmospheric pressure can be calculated with an accuracy that is usually sufficient by using the ideal gas law the molar volume of any ideal gas may be calculated at various standard reference conditions as shown below vm 83145 27315 101325 22414dmmol at 0c and 101325kpa vm 83145 27315 100000

08366ftgram mole vm 107316 51967 14730 37861ftlbmol at 60f and 1473psi technical literature can be confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the ideal gas constant r or the specific gas constant rs the relationship between the two constants is rs r m where m is the molecular mass of the gas the us standard atmosphere ussa uses 831432mpamolk as the value of r however the ussa1976 does recognize that this value is not consistent with the values of the avogadro constant and the boltzmann constant see also environmental chamber iso 1 standard reference temperature for
