ren-robert cavelier sieur de la salle november 22 1643 march 19 1687 was a 17th century french explorer and fur trader in north america he explored the great lakes region of the united states and canada the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico he is best known for an early 1682 expedition in which he canoed the lower mississippi river from the mouth of the illinois river to the gulf of mexico and claimed the entire mississippi river basin for france la salle is often credited with being the first european to traverse the ohio river and sometimes the mississippi as well it has now been established that joliet and marquette preceded him on the mississippi in their journey of 1673-74 and the existing historical evidence does not indicate that la salle ever reached the ohioallegheny valley sieur de la salle sieur de la salle is a french title roughly translating to lord of the manor from the old french sale modern salle hall a manor house sieur is a french title of nobility similar to the english sir but under the french signeurial system the title is purchased rather than earned and does not imply military duty it refers to robert caveliers signeurial purchase of lachine from the sulpician order at ville marie around 1667 the phrase la salle has become iconic and associated with the person as if it were his name in expressions such as robert la salle or simply la salle early life robert cavelier was born on november 22 1643 into a comfortably well-off family in rouen france in the parish saint-herbland when he was younger he enjoyed science and nature as a man he studied with the jesuit religious order and became a member after taking initial vows in 1660 at his request on march 27 1667 after he was in canada he was released from the society of jesus after citing moral weaknesses although he left the order never took final vows in it and later became hostile to it historians sometimes described him incorrectly as a priest or a leader family la salle never married but has been linked to madeleine de roybon dallonne an early settler of new france his older brother jean cavelier was a sulpician priest his parents were jean cavelier and catherine geest lachine required to reject his fathers legacy when he joined the jesuits la salle was nearly destitute when he traveled as a prospective colonist to north america he sailed for new france in the spring of 1666 his brother jean a sulpician priest had moved there the year before he was granted a seigneurie on land at the western end of the island of montreal which became known as lachine la salle immediately began to issue land grants set up a village and learn the languages of the native people several tribes of iroquois in this area expeditions ohio expedition preparation the seneca told him of a great river called the ohio which flowed into the sea the vermilion sea he began to plan for expeditions to find a western passage to china he sought and received permission from governor daniel courcelle and intendant jean talon to embark on the enterprise he sold his interests in lachine to finance the venture journey la salle left lachine by the st lawrence on july 6 1669 with a flotilla of nine canoes and 24 men plus their seneca indian guides himself and 14 hired men in 4 canoes the two sulpicians dollier de casson and abb ren de brhan de galine with 7 new recruits in three canoes and two canoes of indians there they went up the st lawrence and across lake ontario after 35 days they arrived at what we call today irondequoit bay on the southern shore of lake ontario at the mouth of irondequoit creek a place now commemorated as la salles landing indian villages there they were greeted by a party of indians who escorted them starting the next day to a village some leagues distant a journey of a few days at the village the seneca vehemently attempted to dissuade the party from proceeding into the lands of their enemies the algonquins telling of the dire fate awaiting them the necessity of securing guides for the further part of the journey and the obstinacy of the seneca to provide them delayed the expedition a month a fortuitous capture by the indians in the lands to the south of a dutchman who spoke iroquois well but french ill and was to be burned at the stake for transgressions unknown provided an opportunity to obtain a guide the dutchmans freedom was purchased by the party in exchange for wampum while at the indian village in sept 1669 la salle was seized with a violent fever and expressed the intention of returning to ville marie niagara and lake erie at this juncture he parted from his company and the narrative of the jesuits who continued on to upper lake eriethe missionaries continued on to the upper lakes to the land of the potawatomies other accounts have it that some of la salles men soon returned to new holland or ville marie further evidence beyond that the factual record of la salles first expedition ends and what prevails is obscurity and fabrication it is likely that he spent the winter in ville marie the next confirmed sighting of la salle was by nicolas perrot on the ottawa river near the rapide des chats in early summer 1670 hunting with a party of iroquois that would be 700 miles as the crow flies from the falls of the ohio the point supposed by some that he reached on the ohio river la salles own journal of the expedition was lost in 1756 two indirect historical accounts exist the one rcit dun ami de labb de gallin purported to be a recitation by la salle himself to an unknown writer during his visit to paris in 1678 and the other mmoire sur le projet du sieur de la salle pour la descouverte de la partie occidentale de lamrique septentrionale entre la nouvelle-france la floride et le mexique a letter from madeleine cavelier his now elderly niece written in 1746 commenting on the journal of la salle in her possession may also shed some light on the issue la salle himself never claimed to have discovered the ohio river in a letter to the intendent talon in 1677 he claimed discovery of a river the baudrane flowing southwesterly with its mouth on lake erie and emptying into the saint louis ie the mississippi a hydrography which was non-existent in those days maps as well as descriptions were based part on observation and part on hearsay of necessity this confounded courses mouths and confluences among the rivers at various times la salle invented such rivers as the chucagoa baudrane louisiane anglicized saint louis and ouabanchi-aramoni these included segments of those hed actually traversed which were earlier the illinois and kankakee st josephs of lake michigan probably the ouabache wabash and possibly the upper allegheny and later the chicago and lower mississippi he also correctly described the missouri though it was hearsay - hed never been on it confounding fact with fiction started with publication in 1876 of margrys dcouvertes et etablissements des franais margry was a french archivist and partisan who had private access to the french archives he came to be the agent of the american historian francis parkman margrys work a massive 9 volumes encompassed an assemblage of documents some previously published but many not in it he sometimes published a reproduction of the whole document and sometimes only an extract or summary not distinguishing the one from the other he also used in some cases one or another copies of original documents previously edited extracted or altered by others without specifying which transcriptions were original and which were copies or whether the copy was dated earlier or later reproductions were scattered in fragments across chapters so that it was impossible to ascertain the integrity of the document from its fragments chapter headings were oblique and sensational so as to obfuscate the content therein english and american scholars were immediately skeptical of the work since full and faithful publication of some of the original documents had previously existed the situation was so fraught with doubt that the united states congress appropriated 10000 in 1873 which margry wanted as an advance to have the original documents photostated witnessed by uninvolved parties as to veracity discovery of the ohio and mississippi if la salle is excused from discovering the two great rivers of the midwest history does not leave a void on may 8 1541 south of present-day memphis tennessee spanish conquistador hernando de soto reached the mississippi river which the spanish called the rio grande for its immense size he was the first european to document and cross the river though not traverse it it is uncontested that louis joliet and jacques marquette were the first europeans to traverse the upper mississippi in 1673 and that father louis hennepin and antonine augalle visited the falls of st anthony on the upper mississippi in spring 1680 in advance of la salles own excursion in early 1682 credit for discovery of the ohio river is provisionally given to two obscure early english explorers thomas batts and robert fallam from virginia who visited woods river today called the new river a tributary of the ohio via the kanawha in what is today west virginia in sept 1671 other scholars declaim that this short one month expedition did not penetrate to the ohio to the west but elect instead virginia englishmen james needham and gabriel arthur who in 1673-74 circumnavigated the southeast finally traversing shawnee villages along the ohio the lower ohio river first began appearing on french maps about 1674 in approximately its correct hydrography and in its relation to the mississippi though diagrammed more northerly approaching lake erie from the west and may have been confounded with the maumee portage route a memoir by m de denonville in 1688 recites that the lower ohio at least from its confluence with the wabash to the mississippi was a familiar trade route in 1692 arnout viele a dutchman from new york traversed the length of the ohio from the headwaters of the allegheny in pennsylvania to its mouth on the mississippi though the hydrography of the allegheny remained opaque for at least several decades thereafter great lakes forts on july 12 1673 the governor of new france louis de buade de frontenac arrived at the mouth of the cataraqui river to meet with leaders of the five nations of the iroquois to encourage them to trade with the french while the groups met and exchanged gifts frontenacs men led by la salle hastily constructed a rough wooden palisade on a point of land by a shallow sheltered bay originally the fort was named fort cataraqui but was later renamed fort frontenac by la salle in honor of his patron the purpose of fort frontenac was to control the lucrative fur trade in the great lakes basin to the west the fort was also meant to be a bulwark against the english and dutch who were competing with the french for control of the fur trade la salle was left in command of the fort in 1673 thanks to his powerful protector the discoverer managed during a voyage to france in 167475 to secure for himself the grant of fort cataraqui and acquired letters of nobility for himself and his descendants with frontenacs support he received not only a fur trade concession with permission to establish frontier forts but also a title of nobility he returned and rebuilt frontenac in stone an ontario heritage trust plaque describes la salle at cataraqui as a major figure in the expansion of the french fur trade into the lake ontario region using the fort as a base he undertook expeditions to the west and southwest in the interest of developing a vast fur-trading empire henri de tonti joined his explorations as his lieutenant in early 1679 la salles expedition built fort conti at the mouth of the niagara river on lake ontario there they loaded supplies from fort frontenac into smaller boats canoes or bateaux so they could continue up the shallow and swiftly flowing lower niagara river to what is now the location of lewiston new york there the iroquois had a well-established portage route which bypassed the rapids and the cataract later known as niagara falls the first ship built by la salle called the frontenac a 10-ton single-decked brigantine or barque was lost in lake ontario on january 8 1679 afterward la salle built le griffon a seven-cannon 45-ton barque on the upper niagara river at or near cayuga creek she was launched on august 7 1679 la salle sailed in le griffon up lake erie to lake huron then up huron to michilimackinac and on to present-day green bay wisconsin le griffon left for niagara with a load of furs but was never seen again he continued with his men in canoes down the western shore of lake michigan rounding the southern end to the mouth of the miami river now st joseph river where they built a stockade in january 1680 they called it fort miami now known as st joseph michigan there they waited for tonti and his party who had crossed the lower michigan peninsula on foot tonti arrived on november 20 on december 3 the entire party set off up the st joseph which they followed until they had to take a portage at present-day south bend indiana they crossed to the kankakee river and followed it to the illinois river there they built fort crvecoeur which later led to the development of present-day peoria illinois la salle set off on foot for fort frontenac for supplies while he was gone the soldiers at ft crevecoeur led by martin chartier mutinied destroyed the fort and exiled tonti whom he had left in charge he later captured most of the mutineers on lake ontario before rendezvousing with tonti at st ignace michigan mississippi expedition la salle reassembled a party for another major expedition in 1682 he departed fort crevecoeur with a group of frenchmen and indians and canoed down the mississippi river he named the mississippi basin la louisiane in honor of louis xiv and claimed it for france at what later became the site of memphis tennessee he built the small fort prudhomme on april 9 1682 at the mouth of the mississippi river near modern venice louisiana he buried an engraved plate and a cross claiming the territory for france in 1683 on his return voyage la salle established fort saint-louis of illinois at starved rock on the illinois river to replace fort crevecoeur he appointed tonti to command the fort while he traveled to france for supplies texas expedition on july 24 1684 he departed france and returned to america with a large expedition designed to establish a french colony on the gulf of mexico at the mouth of the mississippi river they had four ships and 300 colonists the expedition was plagued by pirates hostile indians and poor navigation one ship was lost to pirates in the west indies a second sank in the inlets of matagorda bay they founded a settlement near the bay which they called the bay of saint louis on garcitas creek in the vicinity of present-day victoria texas la salle led a group eastward on foot on three occasions to try to locate the mouth of the mississippi in the meantime the flagship la belle the only remaining ship ran aground and sank into the mud stranding the colony on the texas coast during a final search for the mississippi river some of la salles remaining 36 men mutinied near the site of present navasota texas on march 19 1687 he was slain by pierre duhaut during an ambush while talking to duhauts decoy jean larchevque they were six leagues from the westernmost village of the hasinai tejas indians duhaut was killed to avenge la salle the remaining men in the party afraid of retribution killed each other except for two the colony lasted only until 1688 when karankawa-speaking native americans killed the 20 remaining adults and took five children as captives tonti sent out search missions in 1689 when he learned of the settlers fate but failed to find survivors the children of the colony were later recovered by the spanish legacy in addition to the forts which also served as authorized agencies for the extensive fur trade la salles visits to illinois and other indians cemented the french policy of alliance with indians in the common causes of containing both iroquois influence and anglo-american settlement he also gave the name louisiana to the interior north american territory he claimed for france which lives on in the name of a us state archaeology in 1995 la salles primary ship la belle was discovered in the muck of matagorda bay it has been the subject of archeological research through an international treaty the artifacts excavated from la belle are owned by france and held in trust by the texas historical commission the collection is held by the corpus christi museum of science and history artifacts from la belle are shown at nine museums across texas the wreckage of his ship laimable has yet to be located the possible remains of le griffon were found in 1898 by lighthouse keeper albert cullis on a beach on the western edge of manitoulin island in northern lake huron results of testing some of the artifacts were disputed many of the recovered artifacts were lost and the wreck was washed away in 1942 a possible shipwreck of le griffon near poverty island at the entrance to green bay in northern lake michigan was located by steve libert of the great lakes exploration group in 2001 the organization prevailed in a lawsuit against the state of michigan over ownership of artifacts in 2012 and in 2013 was issued a permit to excavate the wreck only one artifact a wood pole was recovered and it is indeterminate whether it was from a shipwreck place names many places streets parks
