of chenla under the name kambuja this marked the beginning of the khmer empire which flourished for over 600 years allowing successive kings to control and exert influence over much of southeast asia and accumulate immense power and wealth the indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first hinduism and then buddhism to much of southeast asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects throughout the region including the construction of more than 1000 temples and monuments in angkor alone angkor wat is the most famous of these structures and is designated as a world heritage site after the fall of angkor to ayutthaya in the 15th century a reduced and weakened cambodia was then ruled as a vassal state by its neighbours in 1863 cambodia became a protectorate of france which doubled the size of the country by reclaiming the north and west from thailand cambodia gained independence in 1953 the vietnam war extended into the country with the us bombing of cambodia from 1969 until 1973 following the cambodian coup of 1970 which installed the right-wing pro-us khmer republic the deposed king gave his support to his former enemies the khmer rouge the khmer rouge emerged as a major power taking phnom penh in 1975 and later carrying out the cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979 when they were ousted by vietnam and the vietnamese-backed peoples

withdrew after holding elections in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots the 1997 factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by prime minister hun sen and the cambodian peoples party who remain in power as of 2018 cambodia is a member of the united nations since 1955 asean the east asia summit the wto the non-aligned movement and la francophonie according to several foreign organisations the country has widespread poverty pervasive corruption lack of political freedoms low human development and a high rate of hunger cambodia has been described by human rights watchs southeast asian director david roberts as a vaguely communist free-market state with a relatively authoritarian coalition ruling over a superficial democracy while per capita income remains low compared to most neighbouring countries cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in asia with growth averaging 76 percent over the last decade agriculture remains the dominant economic sector with strong growth in textiles construction garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade the us world justice projects 2015 rule of law index ranked cambodia 76 out of 102 countries similar to other countries in the region name the kingdom of cambodia is the official english name of the country the english cambodia is an anglicisation of the french cambodge which in turn is the french transliteration of the khmer kampuci kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the countrys official name in khmer prh ricinaacak kampuci the khmer endonym kampuchea derives from the sanskrit name kambojadea composed of dea land of or country of and kamboja which alludes to the foundation myths of the first ancient khmer kingdom the term cambodia was already in use in europe as early as 1524 since antonio pigafetta an italian explorer who followed ferdinand magellan in his circumnavigation of the globe cites it in his work relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo 1524-1525 as camogia colloquially cambodians refer to their country as either srok khmae khmer pronunciation srok kmae meaning khmers land or the slightly more formal prteih kampuci khmer pronunciation prteih kampuci literally country of kampuchea the name cambodia is used most often in the western world while kampuchea is more widely used in the east history pre-history there exists sparse evidence for a pleistocene human occupation of present-day cambodia which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the mekong river in stung treng and krati provinces and in kampot province although their dating is unreliable some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during holocene the most ancient archaeological discovery site in cambodia is considered to be the cave of laang spean in battambang province which belongs to the hoabinhian period excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 bc upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to neolithic containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in cambodia archaeological records for the period between holocene and iron age remain equally limited a pivotal event in cambodian prehistory was the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north which began in the late 3rd millennium bc the most curious prehistoric evidence in cambodia are the various circular earthworks discovered in the red soils near memot and in the adjacent region of vietnam in the latter 1950s their function and age are still debated but some of them possibly date from 2nd millennium bc other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are samrong sen not far from the ancient capital of oudong where the first investigations began in 1875 and phum snay in the northern province of banteay meanchey an excavation at phum snay revealed 21 graves with iron weapons and cranial trauma which could point to conflicts in the past possible with larger cities in angkor prehistoric artefacts are often found during mining activities in ratanakiri iron was worked by about 500 bc with supporting evidence coming from the khorat plateau in modern-day thailand in cambodia some iron age settlements were found beneath baksei chamkrong and other angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath lovea a few kilometres north-west of angkor burials much richer than other types of finds testify to improvement of food availability and trade even on long distances in the 4th century bc trade relations with india were already opened and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation also among the artefacts from the iron age glass beads are important evidence different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across cambodia such as the phum snay site in northwest and the prohear site in southeast show that there were two main trading networks at the time the two networks were separated by time and space which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd4th century ad probably with changes in socio-political powers pre-angkorian and angkorian era during the 3rd 4th and 5th centuries the indianised states of funan and its successor chenla coalesced in present-day cambodia and southwestern vietnam for more than 2000 years what was to become cambodia absorbed influences from india passing them on to other southeast asian civilisations that are now thailand and laos little else is known for certain of these polities however chinese chronicles and tribute records do make mention of them it is believed that the territory of funan may have held the port known to alexandrian geographer claudius ptolemy as kattigara the chinese chronicles suggest that after jayavarman i of chenla died around 690 turmoil ensued which resulted in division of the kingdom into land chenla and water chenla which was loosely ruled by weak princes under the dominion of java the khmer empire grew out of these remnants of chenla becoming firmly established in 802 when jayavarman ii reigned c790-850 declared independence from java and proclaimed himself a devaraja he and his followers instituted the cult of the god-king and began a series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th to the 15th centuries during the rule of jayavarman viii the angkor empire was attacked by the mongol army of kublai khan however the king was able to buy peace around the 13th century monks from sri lanka introduced theravada buddhism to southeast asia the religion spread and eventually displaced hinduism and mahayana buddhism as the popular religion of angkor however it was not the official state religion until 1295 when indravarman iii took power the khmer empire was southeast asias largest empire during the 12th century the empires centre of power was angkor where a series of capitals were constructed during the empires zenith in 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2980 square kilometres 1151 square miles the city which could have supported a population of up to one million people and angkor wat the best known and best-preserved religious temple at the site still serves as a reminder of cambodias past as a major regional power the empire though in decline remained a significant force in the region until its fall in the 15th century dark ages of cambodia after a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms angkor was sacked by the ayutthaya kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown this led to a period of economic social and cultural stagnation when the kingdoms internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbours by this time the khmer penchant for monument building had ceased older faiths such as mahayana buddhism and the hindu cult of the god-king had been supplanted by theravada buddhism the court moved the capital to longvek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade the first mention of cambodia in european documents was in 1511 by the portuguese portuguese travellers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade the attempt was short-lived however as continued wars with ayutthaya and the vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and longvek being conquered and destroyed by king naresuan the great of ayutthaya in 1594 a new khmer capital was established at oudong south of longvek in 1618 but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to alternating vassal relationships with the siamese and vietnamese for the next three centuries with only a few short-lived periods of relative independence the hill tribe people in cambodia were hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the siamese thai the annamites vietnamese and the cambodians in the nineteenth century a renewed struggle between siam and vietnam for control of cambodia resulted in a period when vietnamese officials attempted to force the khmers to adopt vietnamese customs this led to several rebellions against the vietnamese and appeals to thailand for assistance the siamesevietnamese war 18411845 ended with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty this later led to the signing of a treaty for french protection of cambodia by king norodom prohmborirak french colonisation in 1863 king norodom who had been installed by thailand sought the protection of thailand from french rule in 1867 the thai king signed a treaty with france renouncing suzerainty over cambodia in exchange for the control of battambang and siem reap provinces which officially became part of thailand the provinces were ceded back to cambodia by a border treaty between france and thailand in 1907 cambodia continued as a protectorate of france from 1867 to 1953 administered as part of the colony of french indochina though occupied by the japanese empire from 1941 to 1945 between 1874 and 1962 the total population increased from about 946000 to 57million after king norodoms death in 1904 france manipulated the choice of king and sisowath norodoms brother was placed on the throne the throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of monivong sisowaths son and france passed over monivongs son monireth feeling he was too independently minded instead norodom sihanouk a maternal grandson of king sisowath was enthroned the french thought young sihanouk would be easy to control they were wrong however and under the reign of king norodom sihanouk cambodia gained independence from france on 9 november 1953 independence and vietnam war cambodia became a constitutional monarchy under king norodom sihanouk when french indochina was given independence cambodia lost hope of regaining control over the mekong delta as it was awarded to vietnam formerly part of the khmer empire the area had been controlled by the vietnamese since 1698 with king chey chettha ii granting the vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before this remains a diplomatic sticking point with over one million ethnic khmers the khmer krom still living in this region the khmer rouge attempted invasions to recover the territory which in part led to vietnams invasion of cambodia and deposition of the khmer rouge in 1955 sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in politics and was elected prime minister upon his fathers death in 1960 sihanouk again became head of state taking the title of prince as the vietnam war progressed sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the cold war sihanouk allowed the vietnamese communists to use cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in south vietnam this policy was perceived as humiliating by many cambodians in december 1967 washington post journalist stanley karnow was told by sihanouk that if the us wanted to bomb the vietnamese communist sanctuaries he would not object unless cambodians were killed the same message was conveyed to us president johnsons emissary chester bowles in january 1968 however in public sihanouk refuted the right of the us to use air strikes in cambodia and on 26 march he said these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop on 28 march a press conference was held and sihanouk appealed to the international media i appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of cambodiathat is i will in any case oppose all bombings on cambodian territory under whatever pretext nevertheless the public pleas of sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued members of the government and army became resentful of sihanouks ruling style as well as his tilt away from the united states khmer republic 197075 while visiting beijing in 1970 sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by prime minister general lon nol and prince sisowath sirik matak us support for the coup remains unproven however once the coup was completed the new regime which immediately demanded that the vietnamese communists leave cambodia gained the political support of the united states the north vietnamese and viet cong forces desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from north vietnam immediately launched armed attacks on the new government the king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government hastening the onset of civil war soon khmer rouge rebels began using him to gain support however from 1970 until early 1972 the cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of cambodia and the armed forces of north vietnam as they gained control of cambodian territory the vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure which was eventually dominated by the cambodian communists now referred to as the khmer rouge between 1969 and 1973 republic of vietnam and us forces bombed cambodia in an effort to disrupt the viet cong and khmer rouge documents uncovered from the soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots then second in command nuon chea nva units overran many cambodian army positions while the communist party of kampuchea cpk expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication in response to the north vietnamese invasion us president richard nixon announced that us and south vietnamese ground forces had entered cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying nva base areas in cambodia see cambodian incursion although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by us and south vietnamese forces containment of north vietnamese forces proved elusive the khmer republics leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures lon nol sihanouks cousin sirik matak and national assembly leader in tam lon nol remained in power in part because neither of the others was prepared to take his place in 1972 a constitution was adopted a parliament elected and lon nol became president but disunity the problems of transforming a 30000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200000 men and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army the communist insurgency inside cambodia continued to grow aided by supplies and military support from north vietnam pol pot and ieng sary asserted their dominance over the vietnamese-trained communists many of whom were purged at the same time the cpk forces became stronger and more independent of their vietnamese patrons by 1973 the cpk were fighting battles against government forces with little or no north vietnamese troop support and they controlled nearly 60 of cambodias territory and 25 of its population the government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents but by 1974 the cpk were operating openly as divisions and some of the nva combat forces had moved into south vietnam lon nols control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes more than 2 million refugees from the war lived in phnom penh and other cities on new years day 1975 communist troops launched an offensive which in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war collapsed the khmer republic simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of phnom penh pinned down republican forces while other cpk units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower mekong resupply route a us-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when congress refused additional aid for cambodia the lon nol government in phnom penh surrendered on 17 april 1975 just five days after the us mission evacuated cambodia khmer rouge regime 19751978 the khmer rouge reached phnom penh and took power in 1975 led by pol pot they changed the official name of the country to democratic kampuchea the new regime modelled itself on maoist china during the great leap forward immediately evacuated the cities and sent the entire population on forced marches to rural work projects they attempted to rebuild the countrys agriculture on the model of the 11th century discarded western medicine and destroyed temples libraries and anything considered western estimates as to how many people were killed by the khmer rouge regime range from approximately one to three million the most commonly cited figure is two million about a quarter of the population this era gave rise to the term killing fields and the prison tuol sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring thailand the regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups the cham muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population exterminated pol pot was determined to keep his power and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats and thus increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the khmer rouge era reduced the vietnamese population in cambodia from between 250000 and 300000 in 1969 to a reported 56000 in 1984 however most of the victims of the khmer rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic khmer professionals such as doctors lawyers and teachers were also targeted according to robert d kaplan eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism religious institutions were not spared by the khmer rouge either religion was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast majority of cambodias historic architecture 95 of cambodias buddhist temples was completely destroyed vietnamese occupation and transition 19781992 in november 1978 vietnamese troops invaded cambodia in response to border raids by the khmer rouge the peoples republic of kampuchea prk a pro-soviet state led by the kampuchean peoples revolutionary party a party created by the vietnamese in 1951 and led by a group of khmer rouge who had fled cambodia to avoid being purged by pol pot and ta mok was established it was fully beholden to the occupying vietnamese army and under direction of the vietnamese ambassador to phnom penh its arms came from vietnam and the soviet union in opposition to the newly created state a government-in-exile referred to as the coalition government of democratic kampuchea cgdk was formed in 1981 from three factions this consisted of the khmer rouge a royalist faction led by sihanouk and the khmer peoples national liberation front its credentials were recognised by the united nations the khmer rouge representative to the un thiounn prasith was retained but he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist cambodian parties the refusal of vietnam to withdraw from cambodia led to economic sanctions by the us and its allies peace efforts began in paris in 1989 under the state of cambodia culminating two years later in october 1991 in a paris comprehensive peace settlement the un was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the united nations transitional authority in cambodia untac restoration of the monarchy in 1993 norodom sihanouk was restored as king of cambodia but all power was in the hands of the government established after the untac sponsored elections the stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup dtat led by the co-prime minister hun sen against the non-communist parties in the government in recent years reconstruction efforts have progressed and led to some political stability through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy in july 2010 kang kek iew was the first khmer rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the s21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in prison however hun sen has opposed extensive trials of former khmer rouge mass murderers in august 2014 a un-backed war crimes tribunal the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia also known as the khmer rouge tribunal sentenced khieu samphan the regimes 83-year-old former head of state and nuon chea its 88-year-old chief ideologue to life in prison on war crimes charges for their role in the countrys terror period in the 1970s the trial began in november 2011 former foreign minister ieng sary died in 2013 while his wife social affairs minister ieng thirith was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012 the groups top leader pol pot died in 1998 geography cambodia has an area of 181035 square kilometres 69898 square miles and lies entirely within the tropics between latitudes 10 and 15n and longitudes 102 and 108e it borders thailand to the north and west laos to the northeast and vietnam to the east and southeast it has a 443-kilometre 275-mile coastline along the gulf of thailand cambodias landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the tonle sap great lake and the upper reaches of the mekong river delta extending outward from this central region are transitional plains thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet 200 metres above sea level to the north the cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles 320 kilometres from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600to 1800 feet 180550 metres this cliff marks the southern limit of the dngrk mountains flowing south through the countrys eastern regions is the mekong river east of the mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into laos and vietnam in southwestern cambodia two distinct upland blocks the krvanh mountains and the dmrei mountains form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the tonle sap and the gulf of thailand in this remote and largely uninhabited area phnom aural cambodias highest peak rises to an elevation of 5949 feet 1813 metres the southern coastal region adjoining the gulf of thailand is a narrow lowland strip heavily wooded and sparsely populated which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands the most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the tonle sap measuring about 2590 square kilometres 1000 square miles during the dry season and expanding to about 24605 square kilometres 9500 square miles during the rainy season this densely populated plain which is devoted to wet rice cultivation is the heartland of cambodia much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve climate cambodias climate like that of the rest of southeast asia is dominated by monsoons which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences cambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35c 70 to 95f and experiences tropical monsoons southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the gulf of thailand and indian ocean from may to october the northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season which lasts from november to april the country experiences the heaviest precipitation from september to october with the driest period occurring from january to february according to the international development research center and the united nations cambodia is considered southeast asias most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change alongside the philippines rural coastal populations are particularly at risk shortages of clean water extreme flooding mudslides higher sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular concern according to the cambodia climate change alliance cambodia has two distinct seasons the rainy season which runs from may to october can see temperatures drop to 22c 72f and is generally accompanied with high humidity the dry season lasts from november to april when temperatures can rise up to 40c 104f around april disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002 with some degree of flooding almost every year ecology cambodias biodiversity is largely founded on its seasonal tropical forests containing some 180 recorded tree species and riparian ecosystems there are 212 mammal species 536 bird species 240 reptile species 850 freshwater fish species tonle sap lake area and 435 marine fish species recorded by science much of this biodiversity is contained around the tonle sap lake and the surrounding biosphere the tonle sap biosphere reserve is a reserve surrounding the tonle sap lake it encompasses the lake and nine provinces kampong thom siem reap battambang pursat kampong chhnang banteay meanchey pailin oddar meanchey and preah vihear in 1997 it was successfully nominated as a unesco biosphere reserve other key habitats include the dry forest of mondolkiri and ratanakiri provinces and the cardamom mountains ecosystem including bokor national park botum-sakor national park and the phnom aural and phnom samkos wildlife sanctuaries the worldwide fund for nature recognises six distinct terrestrial ecoregions in cambodia the cardamom mountains rain forests central indochina dry forest southeast indochina dry evergreen forest southern annamite range tropical forest tonle sap freshwater swamp forest and tonle sap-mekong peat swamp forest environment cambodia has a bad but improving performance in the global environmental performance index epi with an overall ranking of 146 out of 180 countries in 2016 this is among the worst in the southeast asian region only ahead of laos and myanmar the epi was established in 2001 by the world economic forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the united nations sustainable development goals the environmental areas where cambodia performs worst ie highest ranking are air quality 148 water resource management 140 and health impacts of environmental issues 137 with the areas of sanitation environmental impacts of fisheries and forest management following closely cambodia performs best when it comes to handling the nitrogen balance in the agricultural industry specifically an area where cambodia excels and are among the best in the world in addition cambodia has an unusually large area of wildlife protections both on land and at sea with the land-based protections covering about 20 of the country this secures cambodia a better than average ranking of 61 in relation to biodiversity and habitat even though illegal logging construction and poaching are heavily deteriorating these protections and habitats in reality the rate of deforestation in cambodia is one of the highest in the world and it is often perceived as the most destructive singular environmental issue in the country cambodias primary forest cover fell from over 70 in 1969 to just 31 in 2007 in total cambodia lost 25000km 9700sqmi of forest between 1990 and 2005 3340km 1290sqmi of which was primary forest since 2007 less than 3220km 1243sqmi of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of cambodia is under severe threat in 20102015 the annual rate of deforestation was 13 the environmental degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction due to loss of habitats there are many reasons for the deforestation in cambodia which range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural activities the global issue of land grabbing is particularly rampant in cambodia the deforestation involves the local population cambodian businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the world plans for hydroelectric development in the greater mekong subregion by laos in particular pose a real danger to the food supply of vietnam and cambodia upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast majority of cambodias protein and could also denude the mekong river of the silt vietnam needs for its rice basket the rich fisheries of tonle sap the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia largely supply the impoverished countrys protein the lake is unusual it all but disappears in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the mekong backs up when the rains come those fish are so important for their livelihoods both economically and nutritionally said gordon holtgrieve a professor at the university of washington who researches cambodias freshwater fish and he points out that none of the dams that are either built or being built on the mekong river are pointing at good outcomes for the fisheries in the 2010s the cambodian government and educational system has increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and international environmental groups a new national environmental strategy and action plan nesap for cambodia is to be implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the country in november 2017 the us cut funds to help clear unexploded ordnance including land mines and chemical weapons in cambodia which it had dropped during the vietnam war politics government national politics in cambodia take place within the framework of the nations constitution of 1993 the government is a constitutional monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy the prime minister of cambodia an office held by hun sen since 1985 is the head of government while the king of cambodia currently norodom sihamoni is the head of state the prime minister is appointed by the king on the advice and with the approval of the national assembly the prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power legislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral parliament of cambodia saphea damnang reastr which consists of a lower house the national assembly rotsaphea and an upper house the senate protsaphea members of the 123-seat assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum term of five years the senate has 61 seats two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the national assembly and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24 provinces of cambodia senators serve six-year terms on 14 october 2004 king norodom sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member royal throne council part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of king norodom sihanouk a week prior sihamonis selection was endorsed by prime minister hun sen and national assembly speaker prince norodom ranariddh the kings half-brother and current chief advisor both members of the throne council he was enthroned in phnom penh on 29 october 2004 officially a multiparty democracy in reality the country remains a one-party state dominated by the cambodian peoples party and prime minister hun sen a recast khmer rouge official in power since 1985 the open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife bun rany cambodias government has been described by the human rights watchs southeast asian director david roberts as a vaguely communist free-market state with a relatively authoritarian coalition ruling over a superficial democracy prime minister hun sen has vowed to rule until he is 74 he is a former khmer rouge member who defected his government is regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent the 2013 election results were disputed by hun sens opposition leading to demonstrations in the capital demonstrators were injured and killed in phnom penh where a reported 20000 protesters gathered with some clashing with riot police from a humble farming background hun sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985 and is by some considered a long ruling dictator political culture the cambodian peoples party cpp is the sole dominant-party in cambodia since 2018 the cpp commands all but four seats in parliament including all 125 seats in the national assembly and 58 of 62 seats in the senate hun sen and his government have seen much controversy hun sen was a former khmer rouge commander who was originally installed by the vietnamese and after the vietnamese left the country maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary in 1997 fearing the growing power of his coprime minister prince norodom ranariddh hun launched a coup using the army to purge ranariddh and his supporters ranariddh was ousted and fled to paris while other opponents of hun sen were arrested tortured and some summarily executed in addition to political oppression the cambodian government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit cambodias oil wealth and mineral resources cambodia is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world amnesty

party cnrp paving the way for a return to a yet more authoritarian political system corruption the level of corruption in cambodia exceeds most countries in the world despite adopting an anti-corruption law in 2010 corruption prevails throughout the country corruption affects the judiciary the police and other state institutions favouritism by government officials and impunity is commonplace lack of a clear distinction between the courts and the executive branch of government also makes for a deep politicisation of the judicial system examples of areas where cambodians encounter corrupt practices in their everyday lives include obtaining medical services dealing with alleged traffic violations and pursuing fair court verdicts companies deal with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits especially construction related permits and the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process the 2010 anti-corruption law provided no protection

several border disputes between cambodia and its neighbours persist there are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries cambodia and thailand also have border disputes with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to the preah vihear temple in particular leading to a deterioration in relations most of the territory belongs to cambodia but a combination of thailand disrespecting international law thai troop upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the cambodian military have left the situation unsettled since 1962 cambodia and china have cultivated ties in the 2010s a chinese company with the support of the peoples liberation army built a deep-water seaport along 90km 56mi stretch of cambodian coastline of the gulf of thailand in koh kong province the port is sufficiently deep to be used by cruise ships bulk carriers or warships cambodias diplomatic support has been invaluable to beijings effort to claim disputed areas in the south china sea because cambodia is a member of asean and because under asean rules the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative cambodia

growth tourism was cambodias fastest growing industry with arrivals increasing from 219000 in 1997 to over 2 million in 2007 in 2004 inflation was at 17 and exports at 16billion us in the cambodia country assessment where have all the poor gone cambodia poverty assessment 2013 the world bank concludes over the seven years from 2004 through 2011 cambodian economic growth was tremendous ranking amid the best in the world moreover household consumption increased by nearly 40 percent and this growth was pro-poornot only reducing inequality but also proportionally boosting poor peoples consumption further and faster than that of the non-poor as a result the poverty rate dropped from 522 to 205 percent surpassing all expectations and far exceeding the countrys millennium development goals mdgs poverty target however the majority of these people escaped poverty only slightly they remain highly vulnerableeven to small shockswhich could quickly bring them back into poverty two decades of economic growth have helped make cambodia a global leader in reducing poverty the success story means the southeast asian nation that overcame a vicious civil war now is classified as a lower-middle income economy by the world bank group wbg among 69 countries that have comparable data cambodia ranked fourth in terms of the fastest poverty reduction in the world from 20042008 see more details of cambodias achievements on poverty reduction the poverty rate fell to 10 percent in 2013 and further reduction of poverty is expected for both urban and rural households throughout 20152016 however human development particularly in the areas of health and education remains an important challenge and development priority for cambodia oil and natural gas deposits found beneath cambodias territorial waters in 2005 yield great potential but remain mostly untapped due in part to territorial disputes with thailand the national bank of cambodia is the central bank of the kingdom and provides regulatory oversight to the countrys banking sector and is responsible in part for increasing the foreign direct investment in the country between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70 individual institutions underlining the growth within the cambodian banking and finance sector in 2012 credit bureau cambodia was established with direct regulatory oversight by the national bank of cambodia the credit bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the cambodian banking sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the country one of the largest challenges facing cambodia is still the fact that the older population often lacks education particularly in the countryside which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid although there has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors donors pledged 504million to the country in 2004 while the asian development bank alone has provided 850million in loans grants and technical assistance bribes are often demanded from companies operating in cambodia when obtaining licences and permits such as construction-related permits cambodia ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour in the 2015 international trade union confederation ituc global rights index landing in the category of countries with no guarantee of rights in april 2016 cambodias national assembly has adopted a law on trade unions the law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage increases and improvements in their working conditions the concerns about cambodias new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups but international organisations more generally the international labour organization country office for thailand cambodia and lao pdr has noted that the law has several key concerns and gaps independent unions and employers remain as divided as ever how can a factory with 25 unions survive asked van sou ieng chairman of the garment manufacturers association in cambodia gmac adding that it was incomprehensible to expect an employer to negotiate a dispute with 25 different union leaders a law was necessary to rein in the countrys unions van sou ieng said according to gmac last year there were 3166 unions for the more than 500000 workers employed in the countrys 557 garment and textile exporting factories and 58 footwear factories though garment production is already cambodias largest industry which accounts for 262 percent of the countrys gross domestic product van sou ieng said without the trade union law foreign investors will not come to do business only with the trade union law will we employers be able to survive not only cambodia every country has trade union law those who criticize the law should do businesses and then they will understand textiles the garment industry represents the largest portion of cambodias manufacturing sector accounting for 80 of the countrys exports in 2012 the exports grew to 461 billion up 8 over 2011 in the first half of 2013 the garment industry reported exports worth 156 billion the sector employs 335400 workers of which 91 are female better factories cambodia was created in 2001 as a unique partnership between the uns international labour organization ilo and the international finance corporation ifc a member of the world bank group the programme engages with workers employers and governments to improve working conditions and boost competitiveness of the garment industry on may 18 2018 the project advisory committee pac of the ilo better factories cambodia programme met in phnom penh to provide input into the draft conclusions and recommendations of the bfcs independent mid-term evaluation as well as to discuss options on how to further strengthen the programmes transparent reporting initiative the members of the pac concurred with the findings of the evaluation related to the impact the programme has had on the cambodian garment sector and workers including a contributing to sustained overall growth of the garment industry b improving the lives of at least half a million cambodian workers of factories in the bfc programme and many more of their family members c ensuring that workers receive correct wages and social protection benefits d virtually eliminating child labour in the sector e making cambodias garment factories safer overall f creating a level playing field for labour across garment sector g influencing business practices through 1 using factory data to highlight areas for improvement and 2 being a core part of risk management strategies of international brandsbuyers tourism the tourism industry is the countrys second-greatest source of hard currency after the textile industry between january and december 2007 visitor arrivals were 20 million an increase of 185 over the same period in 2006 most visitors 51 arrived through siem reap with the remainder 49 through phnom penh and other destinations other tourist destinations include sihanoukville in the south west which has several popular beaches and the sleepy riverside town of battambang in the north west both of which are a popular stop for backpackers who make up a large of portion of visitors to cambodia the area around kampot and kep including the bokor hill station are also of interest to visitors tourism has increased steadily each year in the relatively stable period since the 1993 untac elections in 1993 there were 118183 international tourists and in 2009 there were 2161577 international tourists most of the tourists were japanese chinese filipinos americans south koreans and french said the report adding that the industry earned some 14 billion us dollars in 2007 accounting for almost ten percent of the kingdoms gross national product chinese-language newspaper jianhua daily quoted industry officials as saying that cambodia will have three million foreign tourist arrivals in 2010 and five million in 2015 tourism has been one of cambodias triple pillar industries the angkor wat historical park in siem reap province the beaches in sihanoukville and the capital city phnom penh are the main attractions for foreign tourists cambodias reputation as a safe destination for tourism however has been hindered by civil and political unrest and multiple high-profile examples of serious crime perpetrated against tourists visiting the kingdom cambodias tourist souvenir industry employs a lot of people around the main places of interest obviously the quantity of souvenirs that are produced is not sufficient to face the increasing number of tourists and a majority of products sold to the tourists on the markets are imported from china thailand and vietnam some of the locally produced souvenirs include krama traditional scarf ceramic works soap candle spices wood carving lacquerware silverplating painted bottles containing infused rice wine agriculture agriculture is the traditional mainstay of the cambodian economy agriculture accounted for 90 percent of gdp in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force rice is the principal commodity major secondary crops include maize cassava sweet potatoes groundnuts soybeans sesame seeds dry beans and rubber the principal commercial crop is rubber in the 1980s it was an important primary commodity second only to rice and one of the countrys few sources of foreign exchange transport the civil war and neglect severely damaged cambodias transport system with assistance from other countries cambodia has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006 most main roads are now paved cambodia has two rail lines totalling about 612 kilometres 380 miles of single one-metre 3-foot-3-inch gauge track the lines run from the capital to sihanoukville on the southern coast trains are again running to and from the cambodian capital and popular destinations in the south after 14 years regular rail services between the two cities restarted recently offering a safer option than road for travellers aiming for some beach time trains also run from phnom penh to sisophon although trains often run only as far as battambang as of 1987 only one passenger train per week operated between phnom penh and battambang but a 141 million project funded mostly by the asian development bank has been started to revitalise the languishing rail system that will interlink cambodia with major industrial and logistics centers in bangkok and ho chi minh city besides the main interprovincial traffic artery connecting phnom penh with sihanoukville resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete asphalt and implementation of 5 major river crossings by means of bridges have now permanently connected phnom penh with koh kong and hence there is now uninterrupted road access to neighbouring thailand and their vast road system cambodias road traffic accident rate is high by world standards in 2004 the number of road fatalities per 10000 vehicles was ten times higher in cambodia than in the developed world and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years cambodias extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade the mekong and the tonle sap river their numerous tributaries and the tonle sap provided avenues of considerable length including 3700 kilometres 2300 miles navigable all year by craft drawing 06 metres 20 feet and another 282 kilometres 175 miles navigable to craft drawing 18 metres 59 feet cambodia has two major ports phnom penh and sihanoukville and five minor ones phnom penh located at the junction of the bassac the mekong and the tonle sap rivers is the only river port capable of receiving 8000-ton ships during the wet season and 5000-ton ships during the dry season with increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use though motorcycles still predominate cyclo as hand-me-down french or cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques carriages attached to motorcycles and rickshaws imported from india cyclos are unique to cambodia in that the cyclist is situated behind the passengers seat as opposed to cycle rickshaws in neighbouring countries where the cyclist is at the front and pulls the carriage cambodia has three commercial airports phnom penh international airport pochentong in phnom penh is the second largest in cambodia siem reap-angkor international airport is the largest and serves the most international flights in and out of cambodia the other airport is

population is largely homogeneous its minority groups include chams 12 vietnamese 01 and chinese 01 the largest ethnic group in cambodia are the khmers who comprise around 90 of the total population in cambodia and are indigenous to the lowland mekong subregion in which they inhabit the khmers historically have lived near the lower mekong river in a contiguous diagonal arc from where modern-day thailand laos and cambodia meet in the northwest all the way to the mouth of the mekong river in southeastern vietnam the vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in cambodia with an estimated 16000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the mekong delta although the vietnamese language has been determined to be a monkhmer language there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early khmers were influenced by the indian cultural sphere while the vietnamese are part of the chinese cultural sphere due to chinese influence vietnamese has developed into a solidly tonal language while khmer has preserved the non-tonal nature of old austroasiatic ethnic tensions between the khmer and the vietnamese can be traced to the dark ages of cambodia from the 16th to 19th centuries during which time a nascent vietnam and thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-angkor cambodia and effectively dominate all of indochina chinese cambodians are approximately 01 of the population most chinese are descended from 19th20th-century settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the french protectorate most are urban dwellers engaged primarily in commerce the indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as montagnards or khmer loeu a term meaning highland khmer they are descended from neolithic migrations of monkhmer speakers via southern china and austronesian speakers from insular southeast asia being isolated in the highlands the various khmer loeu groups were not indianized like their khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern khmers and often from each other observing many pre-indian-contact customs and beliefs the cham are descended from the austronesian people of champa a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day vietnam and former rival to the khmer empire the cham in cambodia number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country almost all cham in cambodia are muslims population centres languages the khmer language is a member of the monkhmer subfamily of the austroasiatic language group french once the language of government in indochina is still spoken by many older cambodians and is also the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded by the government of france there is also a french-language newspaper and some tv channels are available in french cambodia is a member of la francophonie cambodian french a remnant of the countrys colonial past is a dialect found in cambodia and is sometimes used in government particularly in court however since 1993 there has been a growing use of english which has been replacing french as the main foreign language english is widely taught in several universities and there is also a significant press in that language while street signs are now bilingual in khmer and english due to this shift english is now mostly used in cambodias international relationships and has replaced french both in cambodias stamps since 2002 and currency the khmer script is derived from the south indian pallava script religion religion in cambodia 2010 theravada buddhism is the official religion of cambodia practised by more than 95 percent of the population with an estimated 4392 monastery temples throughout the country cambodian buddhism is deeply pervaded by hinduism tantrism and native animism key concepts in cambodian buddhism include reincarnation and religious activities are focused on acquiring bonn pali punna merit and erasing kamm pali kamma karma which for khmers means the negative results accrued from past actions key concepts deriving from animism include the close interrelationship between spirits and the community the efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms and the possibility of manipulating ones life through contact with spiritual entities such as the baromey spirits hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices of tantricism and a host of hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit world for example the important neak ta spirit called yeay mao is the modern avatar of the hindu goddess kali mahayana buddhism is the religion of the majority of chinese and vietnamese in cambodia elements of other religious practices such as the veneration of folk heroes and ancestors confucianism and taoism mix with chinese buddhism are also practised islam is followed by about 2 of the population and comes in three varieties two practised by the cham people and a third by the descendants of malays resident in the country for generations cambodias muslim population is reported to be 80 ethnic cham health cambodian life expectancy was 72 years in 2014 a major improvement since 1995 when the average life expectancy was 55 health care is offered by both public and private practitioners and research has found that trust in health providers is a key factor in improving the uptake of health care services in rural cambodia the government plans to increase the quality of healthcare in the country by raising awareness of hivaids malaria and other diseases cambodias infant mortality rate has decreased from 115 per 1000 live births in 1993 to 54 in 2009 in the same

number of reported landmine casualties has sharply decreased from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 22 dead and 89 injured adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival cambodia is expected to be free of land mines by 2020 but the social and economic legacy including orphans and one in 290 people being an amputee is expected to affect cambodia for years to come in cambodia landmines and exploded ordnance alone have caused 44630 injuries between 1979 and 2013 according to the cambodia mineuxo victim information system education the ministry of education youth and sports is responsible for establishing national policies and guidelines for education in cambodia the cambodian education system is heavily decentralised with three levels of government central provincial and district responsible for its management the constitution of cambodia promulgates free compulsory education for nine years guaranteeing the universal right to basic quality education the 2008 cambodian census estimated that 776 of the population was literate 851 of men and 709 of women male youth age 1524 years have a literacy rate of 89 compared to 86 for females the education system in cambodia continues to face many challenges but during the past years there have been significant improvements especially in terms of primary net enrolment gains the introduction of program based-budgeting and the development of a policy framework which helps disadvantaged children to gain access to education the country has also significantly invested in vocational education especially in rural areas to tackle poverty and unemployment two of cambodias most acclaimed universities are based in phnom penh traditionally education in cambodia was offered by the wats buddhist temples thus providing education exclusively for the male population during the khmer rouge regime education suffered significant setbacks education has also suffered setbacks from child labour a study by kim 2011 reports that most employed children in cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with late school entry negative impacts on their learning outcomes and increased drop out rates with respects to academic performance among cambodian primary school children research showed that parental attitudes and beliefs played a significant role specifically the study found that poorer academic achievement among children were associated with parents holding stronger fatalistic beliefs ie human strength cannot change destiny the study further found that length of residence of parents in the community in which they stay predicted better academic achievement among their children overall the study pointed out to the role of social capital in educational performance and access in the cambodian society in which family attitudes and beliefs are central to the findings crime in 2012 cambodia had a murder rate of 65 per 100000 population on a national level there were a total of 964 murders reported in 2012 prostitution is illegal in cambodia but yet appears to be prevalent in a series of 1993 interviews of women
