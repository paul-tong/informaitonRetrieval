malaysia other neighbouring countries include singapore vietnam the philippines australia palau and indias andaman and nicobar islands despite its large population and densely populated regions indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support a high level of biodiversity the country has abundant natural resources like oil and natural gas tin copper and gold agriculture mainly produces rice palm oil tea coffee cacao medicinal plants spices and rubber indonesias major trading partners are china united states japan singapore and india history of the indonesian archipelago has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources it has been an important region for trade since at least the 7th century when srivijaya and then later majapahit traded with entities from mainland china and the indian subcontinent local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural religious and political models from the early centuries and hindu and buddhist kingdoms flourished muslim traders and sufi scholars brought islam while european powers brought christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the spice islands of maluku during the age of discovery although sometimes interrupted by the portuguese french and british the dutch were the foremost european power for much of its 350-year presence in the archipelago in early 20th century the concept of indonesia as a nation state emerged and independence movements began to take shape during the decolonisation of asia after world war ii indonesia achieved independence in 1949 following an armed and diplomatic conflict with the netherlands indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups with the largestand politically dominantethnic group being the javanese a shared identity has developed defined by a national language ethnic diversity religious pluralism within a muslim-majority population and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it indonesias national motto bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity literally many yet one articulates the diversity that shapes the country indonesias economy is the worlds 16th largest by nominal gdp and the 7th largest by gdp at ppp indonesia is a member of several multilateral organisations including the un wto imf and g20 it is also a founding member of non-aligned movement association of southeast asian nations asia-pacific economic cooperation east asia summit asian infrastructure investment bank and organisation of islamic cooperation etymology the name indonesia derives from the greek name of the indos and the word nesos meaning indian islands the name dates to the 18th century far predating the formation of independent indonesia in 1850 george windsor earl an english ethnologist proposed the terms indunesiansand his preference malayunesiansfor the inhabitants of the indian archipelago or malayan archipelago in the same publication one of his students james richardson logan used indonesia as a synonym for indian archipelago however dutch academics writing in east indies publications were reluctant to use indonesia they preferred malay archipelago maleische archipel the netherlands east indies nederlandsch oost indi popularly indi the east de oost and insulinde after 1900 indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the netherlands and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression adolf bastian of the university of berlin popularised the name through his book indonesien oder die inseln des malayischen archipels 18841894 the first native scholar to use the name was ki hajar dewantara when in 1913 he established a press bureau in the netherlands indonesisch pers-bureau history early history fossils and the remains of tools show that the indonesian archipelago was inhabited by homo erectus known as java man between 15 million years ago and 35000 years ago homo sapiens reached the region around 45000 years ago austronesian peoples who form the majority of the modern population migrated to southeast asia from what is now taiwan they arrived around 4000 years ago and as they spread through the archipelago confined the indigenous melanesians to the far eastern regions ideal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century bce allowed villages towns and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century ce the archipelagos strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade including links with indian kingdoms and chinese dynasties which were established several centuries bce trade has since fundamentally shaped indonesian history from the 7th century ce the powerful srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of hinduism and buddhism that were imported with it between the 8th and 10th century ce the agricultural buddhist sailendra and hindu mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland java leaving grand religious monuments such as borobudur sewu and prambanan this period marked a renaissance of hindu-buddhist art in ancient java around the first quarter of the 10th century the centre of the kingdom was shifted from mataram area in central java to brantas river valley in eastern java by mpu sindok who established the isyana dynasty subsequently a series of javanese hindu-buddhist polities rose and fell from kahuripan kingdom ruled by airlangga to kadiri and singhasari in western java sunda kingdom was re-established circa 1030 according to sanghyang tapak inscription in bali the warmadewas established their rule in the 10th century the hindu majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern java in the late 13th century and under gajah mada its influence stretched over much of present-day indonesia the earliest evidence of muslim population in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern sumatra although muslim traders first traveled through southeast asia early in the islamic era other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted islam and it was the dominant religion in java and sumatra by the end of the 16th century for the most part islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences which shaped the predominant form of islam in indonesia particularly in java colonial era the first regular contact between europeans and the peoples of the archipelago began in 1512 when portuguese traders led by francisco serro sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg cloves and cubeb pepper in maluku dutch and british traders followed in 1602 the dutch established the dutch east india company voc and in the following decades they gained a foothold in batavia and amboina for almost 200 years the company was the dominant european power in the archipelago it was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy and the netherlands established the dutch east indies as a nationalised colony since the vocs establishment the expansion of dutch territory had primarily been motivated by trade starting from 1840 however the netherlands began a period of expansion to enlarge and consolidate their possessions outside java mainly to protect areas already held and to prevent intervention from other european powers as a result the dutch became involved in numerous wars against various native groups in the archipelago throughout the 19th century such as the padri war java war and the long and costly aceh war it was only in the first half of the 20th century that the dutch exerted control over what was to become indonesias current boundaries with the addition of western new guinea in 1920 in 1901 the netherlands introduced the dutch ethical policy that was aimed at improving living conditions and welfare expanding education to native peoples and preparing the archipelago for self-government under dutch control the policy however inadvertently contributed to the indonesian national awakening and subsequent rise of independence movements which the dutch actively suppressed during world war ii the empire of japan invaded and occupied the archipelago effectively ending dutch rule famine and forced labour romusha were common during the occupation and war crimes were committed in areas that were deemed important for the japanese war effort a later united nations report stated that the japanese occupation resulted in a total of 4 million deaths however the occupation proved to be fundamental for indonesian independence as the japanese encouraged and facilitated indonesian nationalism promoted nationalist figures such as sukarno mohammad hatta and ki hajar dewantara and provided weapons and military training modern era just two days after the surrender of japan sukarno and hatta proclaimed indonesian independence on 17 august 1945 and were selected as the countrys first president and vice president respectively the netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule and an armed and diplomatic struggle ensued in december 1949 the dutch formally recognised indonesian independence in the face of international pressure with the exception of the netherlands new guinea which was later incorporated into indonesia following the 1962 new york agreement and the disputed 1969 referendum that led to the ongoing papua conflict despite major internal political social and sectarian divisions during the struggle indonesians on the whole found unity in their fight for independence in the late 1950s sukarno moved indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the military and the communist party of indonesia partai komunis indonesia pki an attempted coup on 30 september 1965 was countered by the army which led a violent purge that targeted communists ethnic chinese and alleged leftists during which the pki was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed the most widely accepted estimates are that between 500000 and one million people were killed with some estimates as high as three million the head of the military general suharto outmaneuvered the politically weakened sukarno and was formally appointed president in march 1968 his new order administration was supported by the united states and encouraged foreign direct investment which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth however his administration was widely accused of corruption and suppression of political opposition indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 asian financial crisis this increased popular discontent with the new order and triggered mass protests across the country which eventually led to suhartos resignation on 21 may 1998 in 1999 east timor voted to secede from indonesia after a 25-year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the east timorese in the post-suharto era a strengthening of democratic processes has included a regional autonomy programme and the first direct presidential election in 2004 political and economic instability social unrest corruption and terrorism slowed progress however in recent years the economy has performed strongly although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious sectarian discontent and violence have persisted indonesia was the worst hit country by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 167736 people mainly in aceh the aftermath of the disaster played a part in achieving political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in the region in 2005 geography indonesia lies between latitudes 11s and 6n and longitudes 95e and 141e it is the largest archipelagic country in the world extending 5120 kilometres 3181mi from east to west and 1760 kilometres 1094mi from north to south according to the countrys coordinating ministry for maritime affairs indonesia has 17504 islands 16056 of which are registered at the un scattered over both sides of the equator and with about 6000 of them inhabited the largest are java sumatra borneo shared with brunei and malaysia sulawesi and new guinea shared with papua new guinea indonesia shares land borders with malaysia on borneo papua new guinea on the island of new guinea and east timor on the island of timor and maritime borders with singapore malaysia vietnam the philippines palau and australia at 4884 metres 16024ft puncak jaya is indonesias highest peak and lake toba in sumatra is the largest lake with an area of 1145 km2 442 sq mi indonesias largest rivers are in kalimantan and new guinea and include kapuas barito mamberamo sepik and mahakam such rivers are communication and transport links between the islands river settlements climate lying along the equator indonesias climate tends to be relatively even year-round indonesia has two seasonsa wet season and a dry seasonwith no extremes of summer or winter for most of indonesia the dry season falls between april and october with the wet season between november and march indonesias climate is almost entirely tropical dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found in every major island of indonesia followed by the tropical monsoon climate that predominantly lies along javas coastal north sulawesis coastal south and east and bali and finally the tropical savanna climate found in isolated locations of central java lowland east java coastal southern papua and smaller islands to the east of lombok however cooler climate types do exist in mountainous regions of indonesia 1300 to 1500 metres 4300 to 4900 feet above sea level the oceanic climate kppen cfb prevails in highland areas with fairly uniform precipitation year-round adjacent to rainforest climates while the subtropical highland climate kppen cwb exists in highland areas with a more pronounced dry season adjacent to tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates some regions such as kalimantan and sumatra experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons whereas others such as nusa tenggara experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season and floods in the wet rainfall is plentiful particularly in west sumatra west kalimantan west java and papua parts of sulawesi and some islands closer to australia such as sumba are drier the almost uniformly warm waters that make up 81 of indonesias area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant the coastal plains averaging 28c 824f the inland and mountain areas averaging 26c 788f and the higher mountain regions 23c 734f the areas relative humidity ranges between 70 and 90 winds are moderate and generally predictable with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in june through october and from the northwest in november through march typhoons and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in indonesian waters the major danger comes from swift currents in channels such as the lombok and sape straits geology tectonically indonesia is highly unstable making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes it lies on the pacific ring of fire where the indo-australian plate and the pacific plate are pushed under the eurasian plate where they melt at about 100 kilometres 62 miles deep a string of volcanoes runs through sumatra java bali and nusa tenggara and then to the banda islands of maluku to northeastern sulawesi of the 400 volcanoes around 130 are active between 1972 and 1991 29 volcanic eruptions were recorded mostly on java while volcanic ash has resulted in fertile soils a factor in historically sustaining high population densities of java and bali it makes agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas a massive supervolcano erupted at present-day lake toba around 70000 bce it is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution though this is still debated the 1815 eruption of mount tambora and the 1883 eruption of krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history the former resulted in 92000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago and made much of northern hemisphere without summer in 1816 the latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and resulted in 36000 deaths that are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created significant additional effects were also felt around the world years after the eruption recent major disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and the 2006 yogyakarta earthquake biodiversity indonesias size tropical climate and archipelagic geography support a high level of biodiversity its flora and fauna is a mixture of asian and australasian species the islands of the sunda shelf sumatra java borneo and bali were once linked to mainland asia and have a wealth of asian fauna large species such as the sumatran tiger rhinoceros orangutan asian elephant and leopard were once abundant as far east as bali but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically sulawesi nusa tenggara and maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasseshave developed their own unique flora and fauna papua was part of the australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of australia including over 600 bird species forests cover approximately 70 of the country however the forests of the smaller and more densely populated java have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture indonesia is second only to australia in terms of total endemic species with 36 of its 1531 species of bird and 39 of its 515 species of mammal being endemic indonesias 80000 kilometres 50000 miles of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas the country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems including beaches sand dunes estuaries mangroves coral reefs seagrass beds coastal mudflats tidal flats algal beds and small island ecosystems indonesia is one of coral triangle countries with the worlds greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1650 species in eastern indonesia only british naturalist alfred russel wallace described a dividing line wallace line between the distribution of indonesias asian and australasian species it runs roughly northsouth along the edge of the sunda shelf between kalimantan and sulawesi and along the deep lombok strait between lombok and bali flora and fauna on the west of the line are more asian while east from lombok they are increasingly australian until the tipping point at the weber line in his 1869 book the malay archipelago wallace described numerous species unique to the area the region of islands between his line and new guinea is now termed wallacea environment indonesias large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues they are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak under-resourced governance issues include the destruction of peatlands large-scale illegal deforestation and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western indonesia malaysia and singapore over-exploitation of marine resources and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and industrial development including air pollution traffic congestion garbage management and reliable water and waste water services these issues contribute to indonesias poor ranking in the 2018 environmental performance index at 133 out of 180 countries the report also indicates that indonesias performance is among the lowest in the asia-pacific region much of indonesias deforestation is caused by the expansion of palm oil industry that requires land reallocation as well as changes to the natural ecosystems expansions can generate wealth for local communities but it can also degrade ecosystems and cause social problems this makes indonesia the worlds largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases such activity also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species including 140 species of mammals identified by the international union for conservation of nature iucn as threatened and 15 as critically endangered including the bali starling sumatran orangutan and javan rhinoceros indonesia is considered at serious risk from projected effects of climate change it is predicted that unreduced emissions will see an average temperature rise of around 1 by mid-century amounting to almost double the frequency of extremely hot days above 35 per year by 2030 a figure which is predicted to rise further by the end of the century this will raise the frequency of draught and food shortages having an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons upon which indonesias agricultural system is based it will also encourage diseases and increases in wildfires which threaten the countrys huge rainforest rising sea levels at current rates will result in 42 million households in over 2000 islands being at risk of submersion by mid-century a majority of indonesias population live in low-lying coastal areas including the capital jakarta the fastest sinking city in the world poorer communities will likely be affected the most by climate change government and politics indonesia is a republic with a presidential system as a unitary state power is concentrated in the central government following the fall of new order in 1998 political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive legislative and judicial branches the president of indonesia is the head of state and head of government commander-in-chief of the indonesian national armed forces tentara nasional indonesia tni and the director of domestic governance policy-making and foreign affairs the president appoints a council of ministers who are not required to be elected members of the legislature the president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms the highest representative body at national level is the peoples consultative assembly majelis permusyawaratan rakyat mpr its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution inaugurating and impeaching the president and formalising broad outlines of state policy the mpr comprises two houses the peoples representative council dewan perwakilan rakyat dpr with 560 members and the regional representative council dewan perwakilan daerah dpd with 132 the dpr passes legislation and monitors the executive branch reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance while the dpd is a new chamber for matters of regional management most civil disputes appear before the state court pengadilan negeri appeals are heard before the high court pengadilan tinggi the supreme court of indonesia mahkamah agung is the countrys highest court and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews other courts include the commercial court which handles bankruptcy and insolvency the state administrative court pengadilan tata negara to hear administrative law cases against the government the constitutional court mahkamah konstitusi to hear disputes concerning legality of law general elections dissolution of political parties and the scope of authority of state institutions and the religious court pengadilan agama to deal with codified islamic law sharia cases in addition the judicial commission komisi yudisial monitors the performance of judges parties and elections since 1999 indonesia has had a multi-party system in all legislative elections since the fall of new order no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats the indonesian democratic party of struggle pdi-p which secured the most votes in the 2014 elections is the party of the current president joko widodo the great indonesia movement party gerindra is the third largest political party other notable parties include the party of the functional groups golkar the democratic party and the national awakening party pkb based on the 2014 elections the dpr consists of 10 political parties with a parliamentary threshold of 35 of the national vote the first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the dpr and the konstituante at the national level indonesians did not elect a president until 2004 since then the president is elected for a five-year term as are the party-aligned members of the dpr and the non-partisan dpd beginning with 2015 local elections indonesia starts to elect governors and mayors simultaneously on the same date political divisions indonesia consists of 34 provinces five of which have special status each province has its own legislature dewan perwakilan rakyat daerah dprd and an elected governor the provinces are subdivided into regencies kabupaten and cities kota led by regents bupati and mayors walikota respectively and also their own legislature dprd kabupatenkota these are further subdivided into districts kecamatan or distrik in papua and again into administrative villages either desa kelurahan kampung nagari in west sumatra or gampong in aceh this number has evolved over time the most recent change being the split of north kalimantan from east kalimantan in october 2012 the village is the lowest level of government administration furthermore it is divided into several community groups rukun warga rw which are further divided into neighbourhood groups rukun tetangga rt in java the village desa is divided into smaller units called dusun or dukuh hamlets which are the same as rw following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 regencies and cities have become key administrative units responsible for providing most government services the village administration level is the most influential on a citizens daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected village chief lurah or kepala desa aceh jakarta yogyakarta papua and west papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces aceh has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system and several regional parties participate only in elections within the province in 2003 it instituted a form of sharia yogyakarta was granted the status of special region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting the republicans during the national revolution and its willingness to join indonesia as a republic papua formerly known as irian jaya was granted special autonomy status in 2001 and was split into papua and west papua in february 2003 jakarta is the countrys special capital region daerah khusus ibukota dki foreign relations indonesia currently maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad including 95 embassies the country adheres to what it calls a free and active foreign policy seeking to play a role in regional affairs commensurate with its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries in contrast to sukarnos anti-imperialistic antipathy to the west and tensions with malaysia foreign policy since the new order has been based on economic and political cooperation with the former indonesia maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of asean and the east asia summit the country restored relations with china in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purge in the mid 1960s indonesia also developed close relations with the soviet union during the first half of 1960s as with the majority of countries in the muslim world indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with israel and has strongly supported the state of palestine it does however maintain quiet relations with israel particularly in trade tourism and security indonesia has been a member of the united nations since 1950 and was a founding member of the non-aligned movement nam and the organisation of islamic cooperation oic indonesia is signatory to the asean free trade area agreement the cairns group and the world trade organization wto and an occasional member of opec during the indonesiamalaysia confrontation indonesia withdrew from the un due to the latters election to the united nations security council although it returned 18 months later it marked the first time in un history that a member state had attempted a withdrawal indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1966 and recently the country has expressed interest in becoming an aid donor military indonesias armed forces tni include the army tniad navy tnial which includes marine corps and air force tniau the army has about 400000 active-duty personnel defense spending in the national budget was 08 of gdp in 2017 and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations the armed forces was formed during the indonesian national revolution when it undertook a guerrilla warfare along with informal militia as a result of this and the need to maintain internal security all branches of the tni have been organised along territorial lines aimed at defeating internal enemies and potential external invaders since its founding the military has always had a strong political influence reaching its greatest extent during the new order following political reforms in 1998 the tnis formal representation in parliament was removed nevertheless its political influence remains albeit at a reduced level since independence the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements some notably in aceh and papua have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides the former was resolved peacefully in 2005 while the latter still continues amid a significant albeit imperfect implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses since the presidency of susilo bambang yudhoyono other engagements of the army include the campaign against the netherlands new guinea to incorporate the territory into indonesia the konfrontasi to oppose the creation of malaysia the mass killings of pki and the invasion of east timor which wasand remainsindonesias largest military operation economy indonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play significant roles the country has the largest economy in southeast asia a member of the g20 and classified as newly industrialised country as of 2018 it is the worlds 16th largest economy by nominal gdp and 7th largest in terms of gdp at ppp estimated to be us1074 trillion and us3481 trillion respectively its per capita gdp in ppp is us13120 while nominal per capita gdp is us4116 the debt ratio to gdp is 292 the services are the economys largest sector and accounts for 436 of gdp 2017 followed by industry 393 and agriculture 131 since 2009 it has employed more people than other sectors accounting for 471 of the total labour force followed by agriculture 311 and industry 217 over time the structure of the economy has changed considerably historically it has been heavily weighted towards agriculture reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency a gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports this development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock during which the gdp rose at an average rate of 71 the consistent growth saw the official poverty rate falling from 60 to 15 from the mid 1980s the economy became more globally integrated as trade barriers were reduced the growth however ended with the 1997 asian financial crisis which severely affected indonesia both economically and politically it caused a real gdp contraction by 131 in 1998 and inflation reached 72 later slowed to 2 in 1999 the economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 08 real gdp growth recent strong economic growth has been accompanied by relatively steady inflation and an increase in gdp deflator and consumer price index since 2007 with improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption growth has accelerated to between 4 and 6 annually this helped indonesia weather the 20082009 great recession during which the economy performed strongly in 2011 the country regained the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997 as of 2017 1012 of the population lived below the poverty line and the official open unemployment rate was 43 though indonesia ran a trade surplus from 1975 to 2017 during the last few years exports and imports have decreased at an annual rate of 3 to 48 from us224 billion and us173 billion respectively in 2011 in 2018 the country recorded trade deficit of us857 billion with total export value of 18006 billion and import 1886 billion the countrys main exports are led by palm oil and coal briquettes with jewellery cars and vehicle parts rubber and copper ore making up the majority of other exports while imports mainly consist of refined petroleum and crude petroleum with telephones computers vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of other imports the countrys main export markets are china 12 united states 11 japan 11 singapore 8 and india 7 while its main import partners are china 23 singapore 11 japan 10 thailand 7 and malaysia 5 transport indonesias transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 250 million people highly concentrated on java all transport modes play a role in the countrys transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive in 2016 the transport sector generated about 52 of gdp the road transport system is predominant with a total length of 537838 kilometres 334197 miles as of 2016 jakarta has the longest bus rapid transit system in the world boasting some 2309 kilometres 1435 miles in 13 corridors and 10 cross-corridor routes rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as angkot and metromini are a common sight in the country most of indonesias railways are located in java used for both passenger and freight transport the inter-city rail network is complemented by local commuter rail services in greater jakarta surabaya and bandung mass rapid transit and light rail transit systems are currently under construction in jakarta and palembang and a plan to build a high-speed rail was announced in 2015 the first in southeast asia indonesias largest airport soekarnohatta international airport is the busiest in the southern hemisphere serving 63 million passengers in 2017 ngurah rai international airport and juanda international airport are the countrys second and third busiest airport respectively garuda indonesia the countrys flag carrier since 1949 is one of the worlds leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance skyteam port of tanjung priok is the busiest and most advanced indonesian port handling more than 50 of indonesias trans-shipment cargo traffic energy in 2016 indonesia was the worlds 9th largest energy producer with 168 quadrillion btu and the 15th largest energy consumer with 75 quadrillion btu the country has significant energy resources including 22 billion barrels of conventional oil and gas reserves of which about 4 billion are recoverable 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane cbm resources and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal while reliance of domestic coal and imported oil has increased indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy with hydropower being the largest source and has the potential for geothermal solar wind biomass and ocean energy indonesia has set out to achieve 23 use of renewable energy by 2025 and 31 by 2050 as of 2015 indonesias total national installed power generation capacity stands at 5552851 mw jatiluhur dam the countrys largest dam serves several purposes including the provision of hydroelectric power generation water supply flood control irrigation and aquaculture the earth-fill dam is 105m 344ft high and withholds a reservoir of 3000000000m 2432140acreft it helps supplying water to jakarta and irrigating 240000ha 593053 acres of rice fields and has an installed capacity of 1865 mw which feeds into the java grid managed by the state electricity company perusahaan listrik negara pln science and technology indonesias expenditure on science and technology is relatively low at less than 01 of gdp 2017 as a result it is not considered as a leading country on the subject however there are several examples of notable scientific and technological developments by indonesians living in agrarian and maritime culture they have been famous in some traditional technologies in the former as with other nations in southeast asia they are famous in paddy cultivation technique terasering bugis and makassar people are well known in the latter making wooden sailing vessel called pinisi boats in the 1980s indonesian engineer tjokorda raka sukawati invented a road construction technique named sosrobahu that allows long stretches of flyovers to be constructed above existing main roads with minimum traffic disruption it later became widely used in several countries the country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned train manufacturer company the indonesian railway industry inka and has exported trains abroad indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in southeast asia to produce and develop its own aircraft with state-owned aircraft company the indonesian aerospace pt dirgantara indonesia indonesia has

the javanese abangan balinese hindus and dayak christianspracticing a less orthodox syncretic form of their religion hindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century ce around 130 a sundanese kingdom named salakanagara emerged in western java and is the first historically recorded indianised kingdom in the archipelago created by an indian trader after marrying a local sundanese princess arriving around the sixth century the history of buddhism in indonesia is closely related to that of hinduism as a number of empires based on buddhist culture were established around the same period the archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential hindu and buddhist empires such as majapahit sailendra srivijaya and mataram though no longer a majority hinduism and buddhism remain defining influences in indonesian culture islam was introduced to the archipelago by sunni traders of the shafii school of jurisprudence as well as sufi traders from the indian subcontinent and southern arabian peninsula its spread was accelerated by missionary works such as by the wali sanga and chinese explorer zheng he and military campaigns by several sultanates for the most part islam overlaid and mixed with non-islamic cultural and religious influences that resulted in a distinct form of islam particularly in comparison to the middle east trends of thought within islam in the country can be broadly categorised into two orientations modernism which closely adheres to orthodoxy while embracing modern learning and traditionalism which tends to follow the interpretations of local religious leaders and teachers at islamic boarding schools pesantren that are supported by indonesias two largest islamic civil society groups muhammadiyah and nahdlatul ulama respectively catholicism was brought to the archipelago by portuguese traders and missionaries such as jesuit francis xavier who visited and baptised several thousand locals its spread faced difficulty due to the voc policy of banning the religion and the dutch hostility due to the eighty years war against catholic spains rule in present-day flores the royal house of larantuka formed the only native catholic kingdom in southeast asia around 16th century with the first king named lorenzo protestantism is largely a result of calvinist and lutheran missionary efforts during the dutch colonial era although they are the most common branch a multitude of other denominations can be found elsewhere in indonesia the batak protestant christian church founded in 1861 by german
