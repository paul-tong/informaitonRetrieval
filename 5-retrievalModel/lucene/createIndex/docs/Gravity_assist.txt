in orbital mechanics and aerospace engineering a gravitational slingshot gravity assist maneuver or swing-by is the use of the relative movement eg orbit around the sun and gravity of a planet or other astronomical object to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft typically to save propellant and reduce expense gravity assistance can be used to accelerate a spacecraft that is to increase or decrease its speed or redirect its path the assist is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft the gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when the soviet probe luna 3 photographed the far side of earths moon and it was used by interplanetary probes from mariner 10 onwards including the two voyager probes notable flybys of jupiter and saturn explanation a gravity assist around a planet changes a spacecrafts velocity relative to the sun by entering and leaving the gravitational sphere of influence of a planet the spacecrafts speed increases as it approaches the planet and decreases while escaping its gravitational pull which is approximately the same but because the planet orbits the sun the spacecraft is affected by this motion during the maneuver to increase speed the spacecraft flies with the movement of the planet taking a small amount of the planets orbital energy to decrease speed the spacecraft flies against the movement of the planet the sum of the kinetic energies of both bodies remains constant see elastic collision a slingshot maneuver can therefore be used to change the spaceships trajectory and speed relative to the sun a close terrestrial analogy is provided by a tennis ball bouncing off the front of a moving train imagine standing on a train platform and throwing a ball at 30kmh toward a train approaching at 50kmh the driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80kmh and then departing at 80kmh after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train because of the trains motion however that departure is at 130kmh relative to the train platform the ball has added twice the trains velocity to its own translating this analogy into space in the planet reference frame the spaceship has a vertical velocity of v relative to the planet after the slingshot occurs the spaceship is leaving on a course 90 degrees to that which it arrived on it will still have a velocity of v but in the horizontal direction in the sun reference frame the planet has a horizontal velocity of v and by using the pythagorean theorem the spaceship initially has a total velocity of 2v after the spaceship leaves the planet it will have a velocity of v v 2v gaining around 06v this oversimplified example is impossible to refine without additional details regarding the orbit but if the spaceship travels in a path which forms a hyperbola it can leave the planet in the opposite direction without firing its engine this example is also one of many trajectories and gains of speed the spaceship can have this explanation might seem to violate the conservation of energy and momentum apparently adding velocity to the spacecraft out of nothing but the spacecrafts effects on the planet must also be taken into consideration to provide a complete picture of the mechanics involved the linear momentum gained by the spaceship is equal in magnitude to that lost by the planet so the spacecraft gains velocity and the planet loses velocity however the planets enormous mass compared to the spacecraft makes the resulting change in its speed negligibly small these effects on the planet are so slight because planets are so much more massive than spacecraft that they can be ignored in the calculation realistic portrayals of encounters in space require the consideration of three dimensions the same principles apply only adding the planets velocity to that of the spacecraft requires vector addition as shown below due to the reversibility of orbits gravitational slingshots can also be used to reduce the speed of a spacecraft both mariner 10 and messenger performed this maneuver to reach mercury if even more speed is needed than available from gravity assist alone the most economical way to utilize a rocket burn is to do it near the periapsis closest approach a given rocket burn always provides the same change in velocity v but the change in kinetic energy is proportional to the vehicles velocity at the time of the burn so to get the most kinetic energy from the burn the burn must occur at the vehicles maximum velocity at periapsis oberth effect describes this technique in more detail historical origins in his paper to those who will be reading this paper in order to build an interplanetary rocket published in 1938 but dated 19181919 yuri kondratyuk suggested that a spacecraft traveling between two planets could be accelerated at the beginning and end of its trajectory by using the gravity of the two planets moons in his 1925 paper problems of flight by jet propulsion interplanetary flights friedrich zander and guido von pirquet made a similar argument the gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when the soviet probe luna 3 photographed the far side of earths moon the maneuver relied on research performed under the direction of mstislav keldysh at the steklov institute of mathematics inter alia by vsevolod alexandrovich egorov purpose a spacecraft traveling from earth to an inner planet will increase its relative speed because it is falling toward the sun and a spacecraft traveling from earth to an outer planet will decrease its speed because it is leaving the vicinity of the sun although the orbital speed of an inner planet is greater than that of the earth a spacecraft traveling to an inner planet even at the minimum speed needed to reach it is still accelerated by the suns gravity to a speed notably greater than the orbital speed of that destination planet if the spacecrafts purpose is only to fly by the inner planet then there is typically no need to slow the spacecraft however if the spacecraft is to be inserted into orbit about that inner planet then there must be some way to slow it down similarly while the orbital speed of an outer planet is less than that of the earth a spacecraft leaving the earth at the minimum speed needed to travel to some outer planet is slowed by the suns gravity to a speed far less than the orbital speed of that outer planet thus there must be some way to accelerate the spacecraft when it reaches that outer planet if it is to enter orbit about it however if the spacecraft is accelerated to more than the minimum required less total propellant will be needed to enter orbit about the target planet in addition accelerating the spacecraft early in the flight reduces the travel time rocket engines can certainly be used to increase and decrease the speed of the spacecraft however rocket thrust takes propellant propellant has mass and even a small change in velocity known as v or delta-v the delta symbol being used to represent a change and v signifying velocity translates to a far larger requirement for propellant needed to escape earths gravity well this is because not only must the primary-stage engines lift the extra propellant they must also lift the extra propellant beyond that which is needed to lift that additional propellant thus the liftoff mass requirement increases exponentially with an increase in the required delta-v of the spacecraft because additional fuel is needed to lift fuel into space space missions are designed with a tight propellant budget known as the delta-v budget the delta-v budget is in effect the total propellant that will be available after leaving the earth for speeding up slowing down stabilization against external buffeting by particles or other external effects or direction changes if it cannot acquire more propellant the entire mission must be planned within that capability therefore methods of speed and direction change that do not require fuel to be burned are advantageous because they allow extra maneuvering capability and course enhancement without spending fuel from the limited amount which has been carried into space gravity assist maneuvers can greatly change the speed of a spacecraft without expending propellant and can save significant amounts of propellant so they are a very common technique to save fuel limits the main practical limit to the use of a gravity assist maneuver is that planets and other large masses are seldom in the right places to enable a voyage to a particular destination for example the voyager missions which started in the late 1970s were made possible by the grand tour alignment of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune a similar alignment will not occur again until the middle of the 22nd century that is an extreme case but even for less ambitious missions there are years when the planets are scattered in unsuitable parts of their orbits another limitation is the atmosphere if any of the available planet the closer the spacecraft can approach the faster its periapsis speed as gravity accelerates the spacecraft allowing for more kinetic energy to be gained from a rocket burn however if a spacecraft gets too deep into the atmosphere the energy lost to drag can exceed that gained from the planets gravity on the other hand the atmosphere can be used to accomplish aerobraking there have also been theoretical proposals to use aerodynamic lift as the spacecraft flies through the atmosphere this maneuver called an aerogravity assist could bend the trajectory through a larger angle than gravity alone and hence increase the gain in energy even in the case of an airless body there is a limit to how close a spacecraft may approach the magnitude of the achievable change in velocity depends on the spacecrafts approach velocity and the planets escape velocity at the point of closest approach limited by either the surface or the atmosphere interplanetary slingshots using the sun itself are not possible because the sun is at rest relative to the solar system as a whole however thrusting when near the sun has the same effect as the powered slingshot described as the oberth effect this has the potential to magnify a spacecrafts thrusting power enormously but is limited by the spacecrafts ability to resist the heat an interstellar slingshot using the sun is conceivable involving for example an object coming from elsewhere in our galaxy and swinging past the sun to boost its galactic travel the energy and angular momentum would then come from the suns orbit around the milky way this concept features prominently in arthur c clarkes 1972 award-winning novel rendezvous with rama his story concerns an interstellar spacecraft that uses the sun to perform this sort of maneuver and in the process alarms many nervous humans a rotating black hole might provide additional assistance if its spin axis is aligned the right way general relativity predicts that a large spinning mass produces frame-draggingclose to the object space itself is dragged around in the direction of the spin any ordinary rotating object produces this effect although attempts to measure frame dragging about the sun have produced no clear evidence experiments performed by gravity probe b have detected frame-dragging effects caused by earth general relativity predicts that a spinning black hole is surrounded by a region of space called the ergosphere within which standing still with respect to the black holes spin is impossible because space itself is dragged at the speed of light in the same direction as the black holes spin the penrose process may offer a way to gain energy from the ergosphere although it would require the spaceship to dump some ballast into the black hole and the spaceship would have had to expend energy to carry the ballast to the black hole the tisserand parameter and gravity assists the use of gravity assists is constrained by a conserved quantity called the tisserand parameter or invariant this is an approximation to the jacobi constant of the restricted three-body problem considering the case a comet orbiting the sun and the effects a jupiter encounter would have tisserand showed that will remain constant where a displaystyle a is the comets semi-major axis e displaystyle e its eccentricity i displaystyle i its inclination and a j displaystyle aj is the semi-major axis of jupiter this applies when the comet is sufficiently far from jupiter to have well-defined orbital elements and to the extent that jupiter is much less massive than the sun and on a circular orbit this quantity is conserved for any system of three objects one of which has negligible mass and another of which is of intermediate mass and on a circular orbit for example the sun earth and a spacecraft or saturn titan and the cassini spacecraft using the semi-major axis of the perturbing body instead of a j displaystyle aj this imposes a constraint on how a gravity assist may be used to alter a spacecrafts orbit the tisserand parameter will change if the spacecraft makes a propulsive maneuver or a gravity assist of some fourth object this is one reason why many spacecraft frequently combine earth and venus or mars gravity assists or also perform large deep space maneuvers timeline of notable examples luna 3 the gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 when luna 3 photographed the far side of earths moon mariner 10 the mariner 10 probe was the first spacecraft to use the gravitational slingshot effect to reach another planet passing by venus on 5 february 1974 on its way to becoming the first spacecraft to explore mercury voyager 1 as of 21july2018 voyager 1 is over 14275au 2136billionkm from the sun and is in interstellar space it gained the energy to escape the suns gravity completely by performing slingshot maneuvers around jupiter and saturn galileo the galileo spacecraft was launched by nasa in 1989 aboard space shuttle atlantis its original mission was designed to use a direct hohmann transfer however galileos intended booster the cryogenically fueled centaur booster rocket was prohibited as a shuttle cargo for safety considerations following the loss of space shuttle challenger with its substituted solid rocket upper stage the ius which could not provide as much delta-v galileo did not ascend directly to jupiter but flew by venus once and earth twice in order to reach jupiter in december 1995 the galileo engineering review speculated but was never able to prove conclusively that this longer flight time coupled with the stronger sunlight near venus caused lubricant in galileos main antenna to fail forcing the use of a much smaller backup antenna with a consequent lowering of data rate from the spacecraft its subsequent tour of the jovian moons also used numerous slingshot maneuvers with those moons to conserve fuel and maximize the number of encounters ulysses in 1990 nasa launched the esa spacecraft ulysses to study the polar regions of the sun all the planets orbit approximately in a plane aligned with the equator of the sun thus to enter an orbit passing over the poles of the sun the spacecraft would have to eliminate the 30kms speed it inherited from the earths orbit around the sun and gain the speed needed to orbit the sun in the pole-to-pole plane tasks that are impossible with current spacecraft propulsion systems alone making gravity assist maneuvers essential accordingly ulysses was first sent toward jupiter aimed to arrive at a point in space just ahead and south of the planet as it passed jupiter the probe fell through the planets gravity field exchanging momentum with the planet this gravity assist maneuver bent the probes trajectory northward relative to the ecliptic plane onto an orbit which passes over the poles of the sun by using this maneuver ulysses needed only enough propellant to send it to a point near jupiter which is well within current capability messenger the messenger mission launched in august 2004 made extensive use of gravity assists to slow its speed before orbiting mercury the messenger mission included one flyby of earth two flybys of venus and three flybys of mercury before finally arriving at mercury in march 2011 with a velocity low enough to permit orbit insertion with available fuel although the flybys were primarily orbital maneuvers each provided an opportunity for significant scientific observations cassini the cassinihuygens spacecraft passed by venus twice then earth and finally jupiter on the way to saturn the 67-year transit was slightly longer than the six years needed for a hohmann transfer but cut the extra velocity delta-v needed to about 2kms so that the large and heavy cassini probe was able to reach saturn which would not have been possible in a direct transfer even with the titan iv the largest launch vehicle available at the time a hohmann transfer to saturn would require a total of 157kms delta-v disregarding earths and saturns own gravity wells and disregarding aerobraking which is not within the capabilities of current launch vehicles and spacecraft propulsion systems after entering orbit around saturn the cassini spacecraft used multiple titan gravity assists to navigate through a complex orbital tour a typical titan encounter changed the spacecrafts velocity by 075 kms and the spacecraft made 127 titan encounters these encounters enabled an orbital tour with a wide range of periapsis and apoapsis distances various alignments of the orbit with respect to the sun and orbital inclinations from 0 to 74 rosetta the rosetta probe launched in march 2004 used four gravity assist maneuvers including one just 250km from the surface of mars to accelerate throughout the inner solar system - enabling it to match the velocity of the 67pchuryumovgerasimenko comet at their rendezvous point in august 2014 parker solar probe nasas parker solar probe mission launched in 2018 will use multiple gravity assists at venus to remove the earths angular momentum from the orbit in order to drop down to a distance of 85 solar radii 59 gm from the sun parker solar probes mission will be the closest approach to the sun by any space mission bepicolombo bepicolombo is a joint mission of the european space agency esa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa to the planet mercury it was launched in 20 october 2018 it will use the gravity assist technique on earth once and with venus twice bepicolombo is named
