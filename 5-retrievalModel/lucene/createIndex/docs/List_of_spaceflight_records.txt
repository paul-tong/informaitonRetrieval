living organisms of any kind to enter space were fruit flies launched by the united states in 1947 aboard a v-2 rocket to an altitude of 68 miles 109km they were also the first animals to safely return from space first animal in orbit laika was a soviet female canine launched on 3 november 1957 on sputnik 2 the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed so there was no expectation for survival she died several hours into flight belka and strelka became the first canines to safely return to earth from orbit on 19 august 1960 longest canine single flight soviet space dogs veterok light wind and ugolyok ember were launched on 22 february 1966 on board cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 march first animals beyond low-earth orbit an assortment of animals including a pair of russian tortoises as well as wine flies and mealworms launched with a number of other biological specimens including seeds and bacteria on a circumlunar mission aboard the soviet zond 5 spacecraft on 15 september 1968 it was launched by a proton-k rocket the capsule came within 2000 kilometres 1200mi of the moon and later successfully returned to earth the first spacecraft in
