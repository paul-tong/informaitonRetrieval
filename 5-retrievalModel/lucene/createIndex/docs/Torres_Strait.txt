the torres strait trs is a strait which lies between australia and the melanesian island of new guinea it is approximately 150km 93mi wide at its narrowest extent to the south is cape york peninsula the northernmost extremity of the australian mainland to the north is the western province of papua new guinea it is named after navigator lus vaz de torres who passed through the strait in 1606 geography the strait links the coral sea to the east with the arafura sea and gulf of carpentaria in the west although it is an important international sea lane it is very shallow 7 to 15m water depth and the maze of reefs and islands can make it hazardous to navigate in the south the endeavour strait is located between prince of wales island muralug and the mainland shipping enters torres strait via the adolphus channel which joins to the great barrier reef lagoon to the southeast strong tidal currents occur in the narrow channels between islands and reefs and large submarine sand dunes migrate across the seafloor some 580 coral reefs including the warrior reefs and eastern patch reefs cover a total area of 2400km 930sqmi in the region as well as some of the most extensive seagrass beds in the world several clusters of islands lie in the strait collectively called the torres strait islands there are at least 274 of these islands of which 17 have present-day permanent settlements over 6800 torres strait islanders live on the islands and 42000 live on the mainland these islands have a variety of topographies ecosystems and formation history several of those closest to the new guinea coastline are low-lying formed by alluvial sedimentary deposits borne by the outflow of the local rivers into the sea many of the western islands are hilly and steep formed mainly of granite and are peaks of the northernmost extension of the great dividing range now turned into islands when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age the central islands are predominantly coral cays and those of the east are of volcanic origins the islands are considered australian territory and are administered from thursday island there are several major policy and institutional frameworks in the torres strait region that support the sustainable use and management of marine resources while also protecting habitats biodiversity and the traditional islander way of life most important of these is the torres strait treaty entered into by australia and papua new guinea in february 1985 the treaty defines sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries it guides decision makers on protecting the way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants on managing the protection of habitats and on sharing the commercial and traditional fisheries resources the treaty established a torres strait protected zone within which both nations manage access to fisheries resources each country exercises sovereign jurisdiction for resources on either side of the agreed jurisdiction lines the islands indigenous inhabitants are the torres strait islanders who are distinct from both the papuans of adjoining new guinea and from aboriginal groups on the nearby australian mainland but related to both the various torres strait islander communities have a unique culture and long-standing history with the islands and nearby coastlines their maritime-based trade and interactions with the papuans to the north and the australian aboriginal communities have maintained a steady cultural diffusion between the three societal groups dating back thousands of years at least two indigenous languages are spoken on the torres strait islands kala lagaw yakalaw kawaw yakawalgau yamuwalgau yakulkalgau ya and miriam mir as well as brokan broken otherwise called torres strait creole in the 2001 australian national census the population of the islands was recorded as 8089 though many more live outside of torres strait in australia environmental issues facing the region include the risk of mining waste from the fly river in southern papua new guinea the impacts of global climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources history the islands of the torres strait have been inhabited for at least 2500 years and possibly much longer the first recorded european navigation of the strait was by lus vaz de torres a pilot who was second-in-command on the spanish expedition led by navigator pedro fernandes de queirs who sailed from peru to the south pacific in 1605 after queirss ship returned to mexico torres resumed the intended voyage to manila via the maluku islands he sailed along the south coast of new guinea and may also have sighted the northernmost extremity of the australian mainland however no specific records exist that indicate he did so in 1769 the scottish geographer alexander dalrymple whilst translating some spanish documents captured in the philippines in 1762 had found lus vaz de torres testimony proving a passage south of new guinea now known as torres strait this discovery led dalrymple to publish the historical collection of the several voyages and discoveries in the south pacific ocean in 17701771 which aroused widespread interest in his claim of the existence of an unknown continent it was dalrymple who named the strait after torres dalrymple was bitterly disappointed that it was james cook and not he who was appointed commander of the expedition that eventually led in 1770 to the british encounter and charting of the eastern coastline of australia in 1770 lieutenant james cook rounded cape york turned south-west and landed on possession island from the top of a hill he signalled down to the ship that he could see a navigable passage through the dangerous strait later in batavia where he learnt that the french had preceded him across the pacific cook re-wrote this signalling drill as a possession ceremony saying he had claimed australias east coast for the british crown in 1823 captain john lihou master of the 550-ton merchant ship zenobia of calcutta was on passage from manila to south america and chose a route through torres strait remarkably this would become the first time for a ship to be navigated through the torres strait from west to east according to the sydney gazette of april 1823 this essay of nautical skill was accomplished after the loss of four anchors and the rudder it was also the first occasion a ship was navigated through the coral sea from torres strait south-eastward to the southward of new caledonia lihou saw sir james saumarez shoal now saumarez reefs on 27 february and named the reef system after vice-admiral james saumarez on this same trip lihou discovered the lihou reef and cays and port lihou originally named port yarborough on the southern shore of prince of wales island please note that lihous ship should not be confused with the 385-ton hms zenobia built at kings lynn in 1807 the london missionary society arrived on erub darnley island in 1871 although some of the torres strait islands lie just off the coast of new guinea they were annexed in 1879 by queensland then a british colony there was an important pearling industry from the 1860s until about 1970 when it collapsed in the face of competition from the plastics industry pearl-shelling was responsible for the arrival of experienced divers from many countries notably japan in 1978 an agreement between australia and papua new guinea determined the maritime border in the torres strait torres strait is mentioned in jules vernes twenty thousand leagues under the sea as a dangerous strait where the submarine the nautilus is briefly stranded the people of the torres strait have a unique indigenous culture which has drawn the interest of a range of anthropological historical archaeological and folklorist researchers both professional and amateur this includes an expedition from cambridge university led by the early ethnographer alfred haddon in 1898 and the more contemporary regional work of australian anthropologist jeremy beckett accounts of local indigenous narrative traditions can be found in the work of nonie sharp and margaret lawrie due to proximity to the papua new guinea mainland the northern torres strait islands experience occasional asylum seeker arrivals from across the strait a total of ten asylum seekers from papua new guinea were detected in each of 2012 and 2013 in 2016 the australian federal police were tipped off by residents of prince of wales island that men from sydney were attempting to buy a boat to reach papua new guinea in order to leave australia without a passport shipping routes the two routes through the strait are endeavour strait purple line on chart for small vessels prince of
