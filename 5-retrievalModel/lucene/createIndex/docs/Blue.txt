blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory as well as in the rgb colour model it lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light the eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors azure contains some green while ultramarine contains some violet the clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as rayleigh scattering an optical effect called tyndall scattering explains blue eyes distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient egypt for jewellery and ornament and later in the renaissance to make the pigment ultramarine the most expensive of all pigments in the eighth century chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain in the middle ages european artists used it in the windows of cathedrals europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from america in the 19th century synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and synthetic dyes dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later in the late 20th century for business suits because blue has commonly been associated with harmony it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the united nations and the european union surveys in the us and europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony faithfulness confidence distance infinity the imagination cold and sometimes with sadness in us and european public opinion polls it is the most popular colour chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour the same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine just ahead of black and was also the colour most associated with intelligence knowledge calm and concentration shades and variations blue is the colour of light between violet and green on the visible spectrum hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine closer to violet pure blue without any mixture of other colours cyan which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green and the other blue-greens turquoise teal and aquamarine blue also varies in shade or tint darker shades of blue contain black or grey while lighter tints contain white darker shades of blue include ultramarine cobalt blue navy blue and prussian blue while lighter tints include sky blue azure and egyptian blue for a more complete list see the list of colours blue pigments were originally made from minerals such as lapis lazuli cobalt and azurite and blue dyes were made from plants usually woad in europe and indigofera tinctoria or true indigo in asia and africa today most blue

about 1706 vincent van gogh used the synthetic pigment cobalt blue for the sky of his 1888 starry night over the rhne vincent van gogh used the synthetic pigment cobalt blue for the sky of his 1888 starry night over the rhne etymology and linguistic differences the modern english word blue comes from middle english bleu or blewe from the old french bleu a word of germanic origin related to the old high german word blao in heraldry the word azure is used for blue in russian and some other languages there is no single word for blue but rather different words for light blue goluboy and dark blue siniy see colour term several languages including japanese thai korean and lakota sioux use the same word to describe blue and green for example in vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is xanh in japanese the word for blue ao is often used for colours that english speakers would refer to as green such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning go for more on this subject see distinguishing blue from green in language linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue colour names often developed individually in natural languages typically beginning with black and white or dark and light and then adding red and only much later usually as the last main category of colour accepted in a language adding the colour blue probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language science and nature optics human eyes perceive blue when observing light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 450495 nanometres blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green pure blue in the middle has a wavelength of 470 nanometres isaac newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the visible spectrum he chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale which he believed was related to the optical spectrum he included indigo the hue between blue and violet as one of the separate colours though today it is usually considered a hue of blue in painting and traditional colour theory blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments red yellow blue which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours red and blue mixed together form violet blue and yellow together form green mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey from the renaissance onwards painters used this system to create their colours see ryb colour system the ryb model was used for colour printing by jacob christoph le blon as early as 1725 later printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta cyan yellow and black ink put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper this method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy in the 19th century the scottish physicist james clerk maxwell found a new way of explaining colours by the wavelength of their light he showed that white light could be created by combining red blue and green light and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours his idea called additive colour or the rgb colour model is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens the screen is covered by tiny pixels each with three fluorescent elements for creating red green and blue light if the red blue and green elements all glow at once the pixel looks white as the screen is scanned from behind with electrons each pixel creates its own designated colour composing a complete picture on the screen additive colour mixing the projection of primary colour lights on a screen shows secondary colours where two overlap the combination red green and blue each in full intensity makes white additive colour mixing the

the complement of blue is yellow that is a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light on a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory ryb where blue was considered a primary colour its complementary colour is considered to be orange based on the munsell colour wheel pigments and dyes blue pigments were made from minerals especially lapis lazuli and azurite cu 3co 3 2oh 2 these minerals were crushed ground into powder and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent such as egg yolk tempera painting or with a slow-drying oil such as linseed oil for oil painting to make

and sea appear blue of the colours in the visible spectrum of light blue has a very short wavelength while red has the longest wavelength when sunlight passes through the atmosphere the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules and more blue comes to our eyes this effect is called rayleigh scattering after lord rayleigh the british physicist who discovered it it was confirmed by albert einstein in 1911 near sunrise and sunset most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the earths surface so that the lights path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red therefore when looking at the sunset and sunrise the colour red is more perceptible than any of the other colours the sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue which comes to the eye of the viewer the colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky reflected by particles in the water and by algae and plant life in the water which can make it look green or by sediment which can make it look brown atmospheric perspective the farther away an object is the more blue it often appears to the eye for example mountains in the distance often appear blue this is the effect of atmospheric perspective the farther an object is away from the viewer the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour which is usually blue in a painting where different parts of the composition are blue green and red the blue will appear to be more distant and the red closer to the viewer the cooler a colour is the more distant it seems blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere giving the earth a blue halo when seen from space blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere giving the earth a blue halo when seen from space an example of aerial or atmospheric perspective objects become more blue and lighter in colour the farther they are from the viewer because of rayleigh scattering an example of aerial or atmospheric perspective objects become more blue and lighter in colour the farther they are from the viewer because of rayleigh scattering under the sea red and other light with longer wavelengths is absorbed so white objects appear blue the deeper you go the darker the blue becomes in the open sea only about one per cent of light penetrates to a depth of 200 metres see underwater and euphotic depth under the sea red and other light with longer wavelengths is absorbed so white objects appear blue the deeper you go the darker the blue becomes in the open sea only about one per cent of light penetrates to a depth of 200 metres see underwater and euphotic depth astronomy blue giants are hot and luminous stars with surface temperatures exceeding 10000k the largest blue supergiant stars are extremely massive and energetic and are usually unstable they are generally short-lived either exploding in a supernova or periodically shedding their outer layers to become red giants blue eyes blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment eye colour is determined by two factors the pigmentation of the eyes iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris in humans the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black the appearance of blue green and hazel eyes results from the tyndall scattering of light in the stroma an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky the irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light which is instead reflected out to the viewer eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions especially for lighter-coloured eyes blue eyes are most common in ireland the baltic sea area and northern europe and are also found in eastern central and southern europe blue eyes are also found in parts of western asia most notably in afghanistan syria iraq and iran in estonia 99 of people have blue eyes in denmark 30 years ago only 8 of the population had brown eyes though through immigration today that number is about 11 in germany about 75 have blue eyes in the united states as of 2006 one out of every six people or 166 of the total population and 223 of the white population have blue eyes compared with about half of americans born in 1900 and a third of americans born in 1950 blue eyes are becoming less common among american children in the us boys are 35 per cent more likely to have blue eyes than girls lasers lasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447nm laser diode technology previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through dpss which are comparatively expensive and inefficient however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics raman spectroscopy and particle image velocimetry due to their superior beam quality blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography dna sequencing optical pumping and other scientific and medical applications history in the ancient world blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration as well as language and literature reds blacks browns and ochres are found in cave paintings from the upper paleolithic period but not blue blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red ochre pink and purple this is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments the earliest known blue dyes were made from plants woad in europe indigo in asia and africa while blue pigments were made from minerals usually either lapis lazuli or azurite lapis lazuli a semi-precious stone has been mined in afghanistan for more than three thousand years and was exported to all parts of the ancient world in iran and mesopotamia it was used to make jewellery and vessels in egypt it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of king tutankhamun 13411323 bc importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from afghanistan to egypt was very expensive beginning in about 2500 bc the ancient egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as egyptian blue by grinding silica lime copper and alkalai and heating it to 800 or 900c 1470 or 1650f this is considered the first synthetic pigment egyptian blue was used to paint wood papyrus and canvas and was used to colour a glaze to make faience beads inlays and pots it was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped in egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity the egyptian god amun could make his skin blue so that he could fly invisible across the sky blue could also protect against evil many people around the mediterranean still wear a blue amulet representing the eye of god to protect them from misfortune blue glass was manufactured in mesopotamia and egypt as early as 2500 bc using the same copper ingredients as egyptian blue pigment they also added cobalt which produced a deeper blue the same blue produced in the middle ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of saint-denis and chartres the ishtar gate of ancient babylon 604562 bc was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions dragons and aurochs the ancient greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark rather than by their hue the greek word for dark blue kyaneos could also mean dark green violet black or brown the ancient greek word for a light blue glaukos also could mean light green grey or yellow the greeks imported indigo dye from india calling it indikon they used egyptian blue in the wall paintings of knossos in crete 2100 bc it was not one of the four primary colours for greek painting described by pliny the elder red yellow black and white but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on greek temples and to colour the beards of greek statues the romans also imported indigo dye but blue was the colour of working class clothing the nobles and rich wore white black red or violet blue was considered the colour of mourning and the colour of barbarians julius caesar reported that the celts and germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies and tinted their hair blue when they grew old nonetheless the romans made extensive use of blue for decoration according to vitruvius they made dark blue pigment from indigo and imported egyptian blue pigment the walls of roman villas in pompeii had frescoes of brilliant blue skies and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants the romans had many different words for varieties of blue including caeruleus caesius glaucus cyaneus lividus venetus aerius and ferreus but two words both of foreign origin became the most enduring blavus from the germanic word blau which eventually became bleu or blue and azureus from the arabic word lazaward which became azure lapis lazuli pendant from mesopotamia c 2900 bc lapis lazuli pendant from mesopotamia c 2900 bc a lapis

ad in henan province china in the byzantine empire and the islamic world dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the byzantine empire in byzantine art christ and the virgin mary usually wore dark blue or purple blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated byzantine churches in the islamic world blue was of secondary importance to green believed to be the favourite colour of the prophet mohammed at certain times in moorish spain and other parts of the islamic world blue was the colour worn by christians and jews because only muslims were allowed to wear white and green dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from spain to central

while only the poor wore blue clothing coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the woad plant blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches this changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in paris when the abbe suger rebuilt the saint denis basilica he installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt which combined with the light from the red glass filled the church with a bluish violet light the church became the marvel of the christian world and the colour became known as the bleu de saint-denis in the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches including at chartres cathedral and sainte-chapelle in paris another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the virgin mary and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing in earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black grey violet dark green or dark blue in the 12th century the roma catholic church dictated that painters in italy and the rest of europe consequently to paint the virgin mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from asia ultramarine blue became associated with holiness humility and virtue ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli from the mines of badakshan in the mountains of afghanistan near the source of the oxus river the mines were visited by marco polo in about 1271 he reported here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues ground lapis was used in byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century but it was impure and varied greatly in colour ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process creating a rich and deep blue it was called bleu outremer in french and blu oltremare in italian since it came from the other side of the sea it cost far more than any other colour and it became the luxury colour for the kings and princes of europe king louis ix of france better known as saint louis 12141270 became the first king of france to regularly dress in blue this was copied by other nobles paintings of the mythical king arthur began to show him dressed in blue the coat of arms of the kings of france became an azure or light blue shield sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis or lilies blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour once blue became the colour of the king it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in europe in the middle ages in france and to some extent in italy the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state in italy the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild the tintori di guado and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty the wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth besides ultramarine several other blues were widely used in the middle ages and later in the renaissance azurite a form of copper carbonate was often used as a substitute for ultramarine the romans used it under the name lapis armenius or armenian stone the british called it azure of amayne or german azure the germans themselves called it bergblau or mountain stone it was mined in france hungary spain and germany and it made a pale blue with a hint of green which was ideal for painting skies it was a favourite background colour of the german painter albrecht drer another blue often used in the middle ages was called tournesol or folium it was made from the plant crozophora tinctoria which grew in the south of france it made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts another common blue pigment was smalt which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder it made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine and was vivid in frescoes but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings it became especially popular in the 17th century when ultramarine was difficult to obtain it was employed at times by titian tintoretto veronese el greco van dyck rubens and rembrandt stained glass windows of the basilica of saint denis 11411144 stained glass windows of the basilica of saint

louis viii of france in 1223 showed that blue had become the royal colour painted in 1450 in the european renaissance in the renaissance a revolution occurred in painting artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen with perspective depth shadows and light from a single source artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules in medieval paintings blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the virgin mary and identify her in renaissance paintings artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights raphael was a master of this technique carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the renaissance and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned the contract for the madone des harpies by andrea del sarto 1514 required that the robe of the virgin mary be coloured with ultramarine costing at least five good florins an ounce good ultramarine was more expensive than gold in 1508 the german painter albrecht drer reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold for just thirty grams of ultramarine often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues such as azurite smalt or pigments made with indigo but this sometimes caused problems pigments made from azurite were less expensive but tended to turn dark and green with time an example is the robe of the virgin mary in the madonna and child enthroned with saints by raphael in the metropolitan museum in new york the virgin marys azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black the introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used ultramarine pigment for instance was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in tempera painting in frescoes to balance their colours renaissance artists like raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine the sombre dark blue robe of the virgin mary became a brilliant sky blue titian created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through which made a complex and luminous colour like stained glass he also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine which gave subtle variations to the blue giotto was one of the first italian renaissance painters to use ultramarine here in the murals of the arena chapel in padua circa 1305 giotto was one of the first italian renaissance painters to use ultramarine here in the murals of the arena chapel in padua circa 1305 throughout the 14th and 15th centuries the robes of the virgin mary were painted with ultramarine

ultramarine blue and white porcelain in about the 9th century chinese artisans abandoned the han blue colour they had used for centuries and began to use cobalt blue made with cobalt salts of alumina to manufacture fine blue and white porcelain the plates and vases were shaped dried the paint applied with a brush covered with a clear glaze then fired at a high temperature beginning in the 14th century this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to europe where it inspired a whole style of art called chinoiserie european courts tried for many years to imitate chinese blue and white porcelain but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from china other famous white and blue patterns appeared in delft meissen staffordshire and saint petersburg

war of the blues indigo versus woad while blue was an expensive and prestigious colour in european painting it became a common colour for clothing during the renaissance the rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a blue dye industry in several cities notably amiens toulouse and erfurt they made a dye called pastel from woad a plant common in europe which had been used to make blue dye by the celts and german tribes blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans not just nobles in 1570 when pope pius v listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration he excluded blue because he considered it too common the process of making blue with woad was long and noxious it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol which was said to improve the colour the fabric was then soaked for a day in the resulting mixture then put out in the sun where as it dried it turned blue the pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from india of the same dye indigo obtained from a shrub widely grown in asia the asian indigo dye precursors is more readily obtained in 1498 vasco de gama opened a trade route to import indigo from india to europe in india the indigo leaves were soaked in water fermented pressed into cakes dried into bricks then carried to the ports london marseille genoa and bruges later in the 17th century the british spanish and dutch established indigo plantations in jamaica south carolina the virgin islands and south america and began to import american indigo to europe the countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo the german government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577 describing it as a pernicious deceitful and corrosive substance the devils dye in france henry iv in an edict of 1609 forbade under pain of death the use of the false and pernicious indian drug it was forbidden in england until 1611 when british traders established their own indigo industry in india and began to import it into europe the efforts to block indigo were in vain the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete in 1737 both the french and german governments finally allowed the use of indigo this ruined the dye industries in toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as bordeaux nantes and marseille another war of the blues took place at the end of the 19th century between indigo and synthetic indigo discovered in 1868 by the german chemist johann friedrich wilhelm adolf von baeyer the german chemical firm basf put the new dye on the market in 1897 in direct competition with the british-run indigo industry in india which produced most of the worlds indigo in 1897 britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market while basf sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo the british industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers but it was unable to compete the synthetic indigo was more pure made a more lasting blue and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests in 1911 india sold only 660 tons of natural indigo while basf sold 22000 tons of synthetic indigo in 2002 more than 38000 tons of synthetic indigo was produced often for the production of blue jeans isatis tinctoria or woad was the main source of blue dye in europe from ancient times until

first rulers to give his army blue uniforms the reasons were economic the german states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye when brandenburg became the kingdom of prussia in 1701 the uniform colour was adopted by the prussian army most german soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the first world war with the exception of the bavarians who wore light blue thanks in part to the availability of indigo dye the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms prior to 1748 british naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs in 1748 the british uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue now known as navy blue when the continental navy of the united states was created in 1775 it largely copied the british uniform and colour in the late 18th century the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution in october 1774 even before the united states declared its independence george mason and one hundred virginia neighbours of george washington organised a voluntary militia unit the fairfax county independent company of volunteers and elected washington the honorary commander for their uniforms they chose blue and buff the colours of the whig party the opposition party in england whose policies were supported by george washington and many other patriots in the american colonies when the continental army was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the american revolution the first continental congress declared that the official uniform colour would be brown but this was not popular with many militias whose officers were already wearing blue in 1778 the congress asked george washington to design a new uniform and in 1779 washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and buff blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the us army until 1902 and is still the colour of the dress uniform in france the gardes franaises the elite regiment which protected louis xvi wore dark blue uniforms with red trim in 1789 the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people and they played a leading role in the storming of the bastille after the fall of bastille a new armed force the garde nationale was formed under the command of the marquis de lafayette who had served with george washington in america lafayette gave the garde nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the continental army blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies opposed to the white uniforms of the royalists and the austrians napoleon bonaparte abandoned many of the doctrines of the french revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye since the british controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to france napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad which had an inferior blue colour the french army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915 when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of world war i it was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants it was considered serious and authoritative without being menacing in 1829 when robert peel created the first london metropolitan police he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark almost black blue to make the policemen look different from soldiers who until then had patrolled the streets the traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the london bobbie was not abandoned until the mid-1990s when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as nato blue the new york city police department modelled after the london metropolitan police was created in 1844 and in 1853 they were officially given a navy blue uniform the colour they wear today navy blue is one of the most popular school uniform colours with the toronto catholic district school board adopting a dress code policy which requires students system-wide to wear white tops and navy blue bottoms elector frederic william of

chemists in europe tried to discover a way to create synthetic blue pigments avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli azurite and other minerals the egyptians had created a synthetic colour egyptian blue three thousand years bc but the formula had been lost the chinese had also created synthetic pigments but the formula was not known in the west in 1709 a german druggist and pigment maker named johann jacob diesbach accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides the new colour was first called berlin blue but later became known as prussian blue by 1710 it was being used by the french painter antoine watteau and later his successor nicolas lancret it became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper and in the 19th century was widely used by french impressionist painters beginning in the 1820s prussian blue was imported into japan through the port of nagasaki it was called bero-ai or berlin blue and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional japanese blue pigment ai-gami made from the dayflower prussian blue was used by both hokusai in his famous wave paintings and hiroshige in 1824 the societ pour lencouragement dindustrie in france offered a prize for the invention of an artificial ultramarine which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli the prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named jean baptiste guimet but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour in 1828 another scientist christian gmelin then a professor of chemistry in tbingen found the process and published his formula this was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product in 1878 a german chemist named a von baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for indigotine the active ingredient of indigo this product gradually replaced natural indigo and after the end of the first world war it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the east and west indies in 1901 a new synthetic blue dye called indanthrone blue was invented which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun this dye gradually replaced artificial indigo whose production ceased in about 1970 today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue thomas gainsboroughs the blue boy includes the lavish lapis lazuli the darker indigo pigment and the paler cobalt thomas gainsboroughs the blue boy includes the lavish lapis lazuli the darker indigo pigment and the paler cobalt the 19th-century japanese

india that had begun in the 15th century impressionist painters the invention of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters jmw turner experimented with the new cobalt blue and of the twenty colours most used by the impressionists twelve were new and synthetic colours including cobalt blue ultramarine and cerulean blue another important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours developed by the french chemist michel eugene chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839 he demonstrated that placing complementary colours such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour to the apogee of their tonality in 1879 an american physicist ogden rood published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum this principle of painting was used by claude monet in his impression sunrise fog 1872 where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun 1872 and in rgate argenteuil 1872 where he painted an orange sun against blue water the colours brighten each other renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in canotage sur la seine 18791880 both monet and renoir liked to use pure colours without any blending monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour in his la gare saint-lazare the grey smoke vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment including cobalt blue cerulean blue synthetic ultramarine emerald green guillet green chrome yellow vermilion and ecarlate red blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods feelings and atmospheres cobalt blue a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide was a favourite of auguste renoir and vincent van gogh it was similar to smalt a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass but it was much improved by the french chemist louis jacques thnard who introduced it in 1802 it was very stable but extremely expensive van gogh wrote to his brother theo cobalt blue is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things van gogh described to his brother theo how he composed a sky the dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt and others of a lighter blue like the bluish white of the milky way the sea was very dark ultramarine the shore a sort of violet and of light

stockings of the previous century he used plain colours such as blue and grey to concentrate attention on the form of the body not the clothes brummel observed if people turn to look at you in the street you are not well dressed this fashion was adopted by the prince regent then by london society and the upper classes originally the coat and trousers were different colours but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable by the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in england and america in the 20th century the black suit was
