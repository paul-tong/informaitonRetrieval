the fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by dutchgermanpolish physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit 16861736 it uses the degree fahrenheit symbol f as the unit several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist the lower defining point 0f was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice water and salt ammonium chloride further limits were established as the melting point of ice 32f and his best estimate of the average human body temperature 96f about 26f less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale the scale is now usually defined by two fixed points the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32f and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212f a 180f separation as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure at the end of the 2010s fahrenheit was used as the official temperature scale only in the united states including its unincorporated territories its freely associated states in the western pacific palau the federated states of micronesia and the marshall islands the bahamas the cayman islands and liberia antigua and barbuda and other islands which use the same meteorological service such as anguilla the british virgin islands montserrat and saint kitts and nevis as well as bermuda belize and the turks and caicos islands use fahrenheit and celsius all other countries in the world officially now use the celsius scale named after swedish astronomer anders celsius definition and conversion on the fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water is 32degreesfahrenheit f and the boiling point is 212f at standard atmospheric pressure this puts the boiling and freezing points of water 180degrees apart therefore a degree on the fahrenheit scale is 180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point on the celsius scale the freezing and boiling points of water are 100degrees apart a temperature interval of 1f is equal to an interval of 9degrees celsius the fahrenheit and celsius scales intersect at 40 ie 40f 40c absolute zero is 27315c or 45967f the rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the fahrenheit scale except that absolute zero is 0r the same way that the kelvin temperature scale matches the celsius scale except that absolute zero is 0k the fahrenheit scale uses the symbol to denote a point on the temperature scale as does celsius and the letter f to indicate the use of the fahrenheit scale eg gallium melts at 855763 f as well as to denote a difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature eg the output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72f and our standard uncertainty is 5 f for an exact conversion the following formulas can be applied here f is the value in fahrenheit and c the value in celsius f fahrenheit to c celsius f 32 f 5c9f f 3218 c c c c celsius to f fahrenheit c c 9f5c 32 f c 18 f 32 f f f this is also an exact conversion making use of the identity 40f 40c again f is the value in fahrenheit and c the value in celsius f fahrenheit to c celsius f 40 18 40 c c celsius to f fahrenheit c 40 18 40 f history fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 basing it on two reference points of temperature in his initial scale which is not the final fahrenheit scale the zero point was determined by placing the thermometer in a mixture of ice of water and of ammonium chloride salis armoniaci or even of sea salt this combination forms a eutectic system which stabilizes its temperature automatically 0f was defined to be that stable temperature the second point 96degrees was approximately the human bodys temperature sanguine hominis sani the blood of a healthy man according to a story in germany fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air temperature measured in his hometown danzig in winter 170809 as 0f and only later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine according to a letter fahrenheit wrote to his friend herman boerhaave his scale was built on the work of ole rmer whom he had met earlier in rmers scale brine freezes at zero water freezes and melts at 75degrees body temperature is 225 and water boils at 60degrees fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more fine-grained he then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature which were at 30 and 90 degrees he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees so that 64 intervals would separate the two allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times since 64 is 2 to the sixth power fahrenheit soon after observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this scale the use of the freezing and boiling points of water as thermometer fixed reference points became popular following the work of anders celsius and these fixed points were adopted by a committee of the royal society led by henry cavendish in 1776 under this system the fahrenheit scale is redefined slightly so that the freezing point of water is exactly 32f and the boiling point is exactly 212f or 180 degrees higher it is for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98 oral temperature on the revised scale whereas it was 90 on fahrenheits multiplication of rmer and 96 on his original scale in the present-day fahrenheit scale 0f no longer corresponds to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above instead that eutectic is at approximately 4f on the final fahrenheit scale the rankine temperature scale was based upon the fahrenheit temperature scale with its zero representing absolute zero instead usage the fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic industrial and medical purposes in english-speaking countries until the 1960s in the late 1960s and 1970s the celsius scale replaced fahrenheit in almost all of those countrieswith the notable exception of the united statestypically during their metrication process fahrenheit is used in the united states its territories and associated states all served by the us national weather service as well as the bahamas the cayman islands and liberia for everyday applications for example us weather forecasts food cooking and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees fahrenheit scientists such as meteorologists use celsius or kelvin in all countries early in the 20th century halsey and dale suggested that the resistance to the use of centigrade now celsius system in the us included the larger size of each degree celsius and the lower zero point in the fahrenheit system canada has passed legislation favoring the international system of units while also maintaining legal definitions for traditional canadian imperial units canadian weather reports are conveyed using degrees celsius with occasional reference to fahrenheit especially for cross-border broadcasts virtually all canadian ovens make legal use of the fahrenheit scale thermometers both digital and analog sold in canada usually employ both the celsius and fahrenheit scales also in some instances swimming pool temperature thermostats or cooking temperatures for example temperatures are still expressed in fahrenheit within the european union it is mandatory to use kelvins or degrees celsius when quoting temperature for economic public health public safety and administrative purposes though degrees fahrenheit may be used alongside degrees celsius as a supplementary unit for example the laundry symbols used in the united kingdom follow the recommendations of iso 37582005 showing the temperature of the washing machine water in degrees celsius only the equivalent label in north america uses one to six dots to denote temperature with an optional temperature in degrees celsius within the unregulated sector such as journalism the use of fahrenheit in the united kingdom follows no fixed pattern with degrees fahrenheit often appearing alongside degrees celsius the daily mail on its daily weather page quotes celsius first followed by fahrenheit in brackets the daily telegraph does not mention fahrenheit on its daily weather page while the times also has an all-metric daily weather page but has a celsius-to-fahrenheit conversion table when publishing news stories much of the uk press and population have adopted a convention of using degrees celsius in headlines and discussion relating to low temperatures and fahrenheit for high temperatures in february 2006 the writer of an article in the times suggested that the rationale was one of emphasis 6 c sounds colder than 21 f and 94 f sounds more impressive than 34 c unicode representation of symbol unicode provides the fahrenheit symbol at code point u2109 degree fahrenheit however this is a compatibility character encoded for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character the sequence u00b0 degree sign u0046 f latin capital letter f is preferred over u2109 degree fahrenheit and those two sequences should be treated as identical for searching see also energy portal comparison of temperature scales degree of
