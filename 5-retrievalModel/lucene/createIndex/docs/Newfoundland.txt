the most easterly province in canada and is located at the north-eastern corner of north america the strait of belle isle separates the province into two geographical divisions labrador which is a large area of mainland canada and newfoundland an island in the atlantic ocean the province also includes over 7000 tiny islands newfoundland is roughly triangular each side is about 400km 250mi long and its area is 108860km 42030sqmi newfoundland and its neighbouring small islands excluding french possessions have a total area of 111390km 43010sqmi newfoundland extends between latitudes 4636n and 5138n labrador is an irregular shape the western part of its border with quebec is the drainage divide of the labrador peninsula lands drained by rivers that flow into the atlantic ocean are part of labrador and the rest belongs to quebec most of labradors southern boundary with quebec follows the 52nd parallel of latitude labradors extreme northern tip at 6022n shares a short border with nunavut labradors area including associated small islands is 294330km 113640sqmi together newfoundland and labrador make up 406 of canadas area with a total area of 405720km 156650sqmi labrador is the easternmost part of the canadian shield a vast area of ancient metamorphic rock comprising much of northeastern north america colliding tectonic plates have shaped much of the geology of newfoundland gros morne national park has a reputation as an outstanding example of tectonics at work and as such has been designated a world heritage site the long range mountains on newfoundlands west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the appalachian mountains the north-south extent of the province 4636n to 6022n prevalent westerly winds cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province northern labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate southern labrador has a subarctic climate while most of newfoundland has a humid continental climate dfb under the kppen climate classification system cool summer subtype climate newfoundland and labrador has a wide range of climates and weather due to its geography the island of newfoundland spans 5 degrees of latitude comparable to the great lakes the province has been divided into six climate types but broadly newfoundland has a cool summer subtype of a humid continental climate which is greatly influenced by the sea since no part of the island is more than 100km 62mi from the ocean northern labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate southern labrador has a subarctic climate monthly average temperatures rainfall and snowfall for four places are shown in the attached graphs st johns represents the east coast gander the interior of the island corner brook the west coast of the island and wabush the interior of labrador climate data for 56 places in the province is available from environment canada the data for the graphs is the average over thirty years error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows snowfall is the total amount that fell during the month not the amount accumulated on the ground this distinction is particularly important for st johns where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground surface water temperatures on the atlantic side reach a summer average of 12c 54f inshore and 9c 48f offshore to winter lows of 1c 30f inshore and 2c 36f offshore sea temperatures on the west coast are warmer than atlantic side by 1 to 3c 1 to 5f the sea keeps winter temperatures slightly higher and summer temperatures a little lower on the coast than inland the maritime climate produces more variable weather ample precipitation in a variety of forms greater humidity lower visibility more clouds less sunshine and higher winds than a continental climate history pre-colonisation human habitation in newfoundland and labrador can be traced back about 9000 years the maritime archaic peoples were groups of archaic cultures of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic they prospered along the atlantic coast of north america from about 7000bc to 1500bc their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses they engaged in long-distance trade using as currency white chert a rock quarried from northern labrador to maine the southern branch of these people was established on the north peninsula of newfoundland by 5000 years ago the maritime archaic period is best known from a mortuary site in newfoundland at port au choix the maritime archaic peoples were gradually displaced by people of the dorset culture late paleo-eskimo who also occupied port au choix the number of their sites discovered on newfoundland indicates they may have been the most numerous group of aboriginal people to live there they thrived from about 2000 bc to ad 800 many of their sites were located on exposed headlands and outer islands they were more oriented to the sea than earlier peoples and had developed sleds and boats similar to kayaks they burned seal blubber in soapstone lamps many of these sites such as port au choix recently excavated by memorial archaeologist priscilla renouf are quite large and show evidence of a long-term commitment to place renouf has excavated huge amounts of harp seal bones at port au choix indicating that this place was a prime location for the hunting of these animals the people of the dorset culture 800 bc ad 1500 were highly adapted to living in a very cold climate and much of their food came from hunting sea mammals through holes in the ice the massive decline in sea ice during the medieval warm period would have had a devastating impact upon their way of life the appearance of the beothuk culture is believed to be the most recent cultural manifestation of peoples who first migrated from labrador to newfoundland around 1 ad the inuit found mostly in labrador are the descendants of what anthropologists call the thule people who emerged from western alaska around ad 1000 and spread eastwards across the high arctic reaching labrador around 13001500 researchers believe that the dorset culture lacked the dogs larger weapons and other technologies that gave the expanding inuit people an advantage over time groups started to focus on resources available to them locally the inhabitants eventually organized themselves into small bands of a few families grouped into larger tribes and chieftainships the innu are the inhabitants of an area they refer to as nitassinan ie most of what is now referred to as northeastern quebec and labrador their subsistence activities were historically centred on hunting and trapping caribou deer and small game coastal clans also practiced agriculture fished and managed maple sugar bush the innu engaged in tribal warfare along the coast of labrador with the inuit groups that had significant populations the mikmaq of southern newfoundland spent most of their time on the shores harvesting seafood during the winter they would move inland to the woods to hunt over time the mikmaq and innu divided their lands into traditional districts each district was independently governed and had a district chief and a council the council members were band chiefs elders and other worthy community leaders in addition to the district councils the mikmaq tribes also had have a grand council or sant mawimi which according to oral tradition was formed before 1600 descendants of the beothuks by the time that european contact with newfoundland began in the early 16th century the beothuk were the only indigenous group living permanently on the island unlike other groups in the northeastern area of the americas the beothuk never established sustained trading relations with european settlers instead their trading interactions were sporadic and they largely attempted to avoid contact in order to preserve their culture the establishment of english fishing operations on the outer coastline of the island and their later expansion into bays and inlets cut off access for the beothuk to their traditional sources of food in the 18th century as the beothuk were driven further inland by these encroachments violence between beothuk and settlers escalated with each retaliating against the other in their competition for resources by the early 19th century violence starvation and exposure to tuberculosis had decimated the beothuk population and they were extinct as a cultural group by 1829 geneticists have suggested that some icelanders may carry beothuk dna which has been passed down matrilineally over the centuries this suggests that when the vikings abandoned their colonization of newfoundland around 1000 ad they might have brought back beothuk women to europe european contact the oldest confirmed accounts of european contact date from a thousand years ago as described in the viking norse icelandic sagas around the year 1001 the sagas refer to leif ericson landing in three places to the west the first two being helluland possibly baffin island and markland possibly labrador leifs third landing was at a place he called vinland possibly newfoundland archaeological evidence of a norse settlement was found in lanse aux meadows newfoundland which was declared a world heritage site by unesco in 1978 there are several other unconfirmed accounts of european discovery and exploration one tale by men from the channel islands being blown off course in the late 15th century into a strange land full of fish and another from portuguese maps that depict the terra do bacalhau or land of codfish west of the azores the earliest though is the voyage of saint brendan the fantastical account of an irish monk who made a sea voyage in the early 6th century while the story itself became a part of myth and legend some historians believe it is based on fact in 1496 john cabot obtained a charter from english king henry vii to sail to all parts countries and seas of the east the west and of the north under our banner and ensign and to set up our banner on any new-found-land and on june 24 1497 landed in cape bonavista historians disagree on whether cabot landed in nova scotia in 1497 or in newfoundland or possibly maine if he landed at all but bonavista is recognised by the governments of canada and the united kingdom as being cabots official landing place in 1499 and 1500 portuguese mariners joo fernandes lavrador and pro de barcelos explored and mapped the coast the formers name appearing as labrador on topographical maps of the period based on the treaty of tordesillas the portuguese crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by john cabot in 1497 and 1498 subsequently in 1501 and 1502 the corte-real brothers miguel and gaspar explored newfoundland and labrador claiming them as part of the portuguese empire in 1506 king manuel i of portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in newfoundland waters joo lvares fagundes and pro de barcelos established seasonal fishing outposts in newfoundland and nova scotia around 1521 and older portuguese settlements may have existed sir humphrey gilbert provided with letters patent from queen elizabeth i landed in st johns in august 1583 and formally took possession of the island colony of newfoundland sometime before 1563 basque fishermen who had been fishing cod shoals off newfoundlands coasts since the beginning of the sixteenth century founded plaisance today placentia a seasonal haven which french fishermen later also used in the newfoundland will now in an archive in spain of the basque seaman domingo de luca dated 1563 de luca asks that my body be buried in this port of plazenia in the place where those who die here are usually buried this will is the oldest known civil document written in canada twenty years later in 1583 newfoundland became englands first possession in north america and one of the earliest permanent english colonies in the new world when sir humphrey gilbert claimed it for queen elizabeth though english fishing boats had visited newfoundland continuously since cabots second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior the basque french and portuguese had done likewise in 1585 however this changed bernard drake led a devastating raid on the spanish and portuguese fisheries from which they never recovered this provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of proprietary governors to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728 john guy became governor of the first settlement at cupers cove other settlements included bristols hope renews new cambriol south falkland and avalon which became a province in 1623 the first governor given jurisdiction over all of newfoundland was sir david kirke in 1638 explorers quickly realized that the waters around newfoundland had the best fishing in the north atlantic by 1620 300 fishing boats worked the grand banks employing some 10000 sailors many continuing to come from the basque country normandy or brittany they dried and salted cod on the coast and sold it to spain and portugal heavy investment by sir george calvert 1st baron baltimore in the 1620s in wharves warehouses and fishing stations failed to pay off french raids hurt the business and the weather was terrible so he redirected his attention to his other colony in maryland after calvert left small-scale entrepreneurs such as sir david kirke made good use of the facilities kirke became the first governor of newfoundland in 1638 a triangular trade with new england the west indies and europe gave newfoundland an important economic role by the 1670s there were 1700 permanent residents and another 4500 in the summer months in 1655 france appointed a governor in plaisance the formerly basque fishing settlement thus starting a formal french colonization period in newfoundland as well as a period of periodic war and unrest between england and france in the region the mikmaq as allies of the french were amenable to limited french settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the english english attacks on placentia provoked retaliation by new france explorer pierre le moyne diberville who during king williams war in the 1690s destroyed nearly every english settlement on the island the entire population of the english colony was either killed captured for ransom or sentenced to expulsion to england with the exception of those who withstood the attack at carbonear island and those in the then remote bonavista after france lost political control of the area after the siege of port royal in 1710 the mkmaq engaged in warfare with the british throughout dummers war 17221725 king georges war 17441748 father le loutres war 17491755 and the french and indian war 17541763 the french colonization period lasted until the treaty of utrecht of 1713 which ended the war of the spanish succession france ceded to the british its claims to newfoundland including its claims to the shores of hudson bay and to the french possessions in acadia afterward under the supervision of the last french governor the french population of plaisance moved to le royale now cape breton island part of acadia which remained then under french control in the treaty of utrecht 1713 france had acknowledged british ownership of the island however in the seven years war 17561763 control of newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between britain france and spain who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there britains victories around the globe led william pitt to insist that nobody other than britain should have access to newfoundland the battle of signal hill took place in newfoundland in 1762 when a french force landed and tried to occupy the island only to be repulsed by the british from 1763 to 1767 james cook made a detailed survey of the coasts of newfoundland and southern labrador while commander of hmsgrenville the following year 1768 cook began his first circumnavigation of the world in 1796 a franco-spanish expedition again succeeded in raiding the coasts of newfoundland and labrador destroying many of the settlements by the treaty of utrecht 1713 french fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the french shore on the western coast they had a permanent base on nearby st pierre and miquelon islands the french gave up their french shore rights in 1904 in 1783 the british signed the treaty of paris with the united states that gave american fishermen similar rights along the coast these rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818 1854 and 1871 and confirmed by arbitration in 1910 in 1854 the british government established newfoundlands responsible government in 1855 philip francis little a native of prince edward island won a parliamentary majority over hugh hoyles and the conservatives little formed the first newfoundland administration 1855-1858 newfoundland rejected confederation with canada in the 1869 general election prime minister of canada sir john thompson came very close to negotiating newfoundlands entry into confederation in 1892 dominion of newfoundland newfoundland remained a colony until acquiring dominion status in 1907 a dominion constituted a self-governing state of the british empire or british commonwealth and the dominion of newfoundland was relatively autonomous from british rule newfoundlands own regiment the 1st newfoundland regiment fought in the first world war on july 1 1916 nearly the entire regiment was wiped out at beaumont-hamel on the first day on the somme the regiment went on to serve with distinction in several subsequent battles earning the prefix royal despite peoples pride in the accomplishments of the regiment the dominions war debt due to the regiment and the cost of maintaining a trans-island railway led to increased and ultimately unsustainable government debt in the post-war era since the early 1800s newfoundland and quebec or lower canada had been in a border dispute over the labrador region in 1927 however the british government ruled that the area known as modern-day labrador was to be considered part of the dominion of newfoundland commission of government and confederation with canada due to newfoundlands high debt load arising from world war i and construction of the newfoundland railway and decreasing revenue due to the collapse of fish prices the dominion legislature voted itself out of existence in 1933 in exchange for loan guarantees by the crown and a promise it would be re-established on february 16 1934 the commission of government was sworn in ending 79 years of responsible government the commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the british government for 15 years no elections took place and no legislature was convened when prosperity returned with world war ii agitation began to end the commission and reinstate responsible government instead the british government created the national convention in 1946 reflecting the efforts toward self-determination that arose in europe following the war the convention chaired by judge cyril j fox consisted of 45 elected members from across the dominion and was formally tasked with advising on the future of newfoundland several motions were made by joey smallwood a convention member who later served as the first provincial premier of newfoundland to examine joining canada by sending a delegation to ottawa the first motion was defeated although the convention later decided to send delegations to both london and ottawa to explore alternatives in january 1948 the national convention voted against putting confederation onto the referendum 29 to 16 but the british which controlled the national convention and the subsequent referendum overruled this vote those who supported confederation were extremely disappointed with the recommendations of the national convention and organized a petition signed by more than 50000 newfoundlanders demanding that confederation with canada be placed before the people in the upcoming referendum as most historians agree the british government keenly wanted confederation on the ballot and ensured that it would be three main factions actively campaigned during the lead-up to the referenda smallwood led the confederate association ca advocating entry into the canadian confederation they campaigned through a newspaper known as the confederate the responsible government league rgl led by peter cashin advocated an independent newfoundland with a return to responsible government their newspaper was the independent a third the smaller economic union party eup led by chesley crosbie advocated closer economic ties with the united states though a 1947 poll found 80 of newfoundland residents wanting to become americans the eup failed to gain much attention and merged with the rgl after the first referendum the first referendum took place on june 3 1948 446 of people voted for responsible government 411 voted for confederation with canada while 143 voted for the commission of government since none of the choices had gained over 50 a second referendum with only the two more popular choices was held on july 22 1948 the official outcome of that referendum was 523 for confederation with canada and 477 for responsible independent government after the referendum the british governor named a seven-man delegation to negotiate canadas offer on behalf of newfoundland after six of the delegation signed the british government passed the british north america act 1949 through parliament newfoundland officially joined canada at midnight on march 31 1949 as documents in british and canadian archives became available in the 1980s it became clear that both canada and the united kingdom wanted newfoundland to join canada some have charged that it was a conspiracy to manoeuvre newfoundland into confederation in exchange for forgiveness of britains war debt and for other considerations yet most historians who have examined the government documents have concluded that while britain engineered the inclusion of a confederation option in the referendum newfoundlanders made the final decision themselves if by a narrow margin following the referendum there was a rumour that the referendum had been narrowly won by the responsible government side but that the result had been fixed by the british governor shortly after the referendum several boxes of ballots from st johns were burned by order of herman william quinton one of only two commissioners who supported confederation some have argued that independent oversight of the vote tallying was lacking though the process was supervised by respected corner brook magistrate nehemiah short who had also overseen elections to the national convention provincial flag newfoundland and labradors present provincial flag designed by newfoundland artist christopher pratt was officially adopted by the legislature on may 28 1980 and first flown on discovery day that year labrador has its own unofficial flag created in 1973 by mike martin former member of the legislative assembly for labrador south the blue is meant to represent the sea the white represents snow and ice the red represents the efforts and struggles of the people and the gold represents the confidence of newfoundlanders and labradorians the blue triangles are a tribute to the union flag and represent the british heritage of the province the two red triangles represent labrador the mainland portion of the province and the island in pratts words the golden arrow points towards a brighter future the pink white and green is a flag of 19th-century origins that enjoyed popularity in portions of the island in the late 19th century it was flown on some vessels into the 20th century it was never adopted by the newfoundland government a 1976 article reported that the tricolour flag was created in 1843 by then roman catholic bishop of newfoundland michael anthony fleming the colours were intended to represent the symbolic union of newfoundlands historically dominant ethnicreligious groups english scots and irish though popular there is no historical evidence to support this legend recent scholarship suggests that the flag was first used in the 1870s or later by the roman catholic star of the sea fishermens association it resembled the unofficial flag of ireland the tri-colour flag remained relatively unknown outside of st johns and the avalon peninsula until the growth of the tourist industry since the late 20th century it has been used as an emblem on items in gift shops in st johns and other towns some tourists assume it is the irish flag the pink white and green has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with irish heritage and as a political statement many of the provinces protestants who make up nearly 60 of the provinces total population may not identify with this heritage at the same time many of the provinces catholics approximately 37 of the total population with at least 22 of the population claiming irish ancestry think that the current provincial flag does not satisfactorily represent them but a government-sponsored poll in 2005 revealed that 75 of newfoundlanders rejected adoption of the tricolour flag as the provinces official flag pre-confederation and current provincial anthem the pre-confederation and current provincial anthem is the ode to newfoundland written by british colonial governor sir charles cavendish boyle in 1902 during his administration of newfoundland 1901 to 1904 it was adopted as the official newfoundland anthem on may 20 1904 in 1980 the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem making this the only province in canada to officially adopt an anthem the ode to newfoundland is still sung at public events in newfoundland and labrador demographics newfoundland and labrador has a population of 519716 more than half of whom live on the avalon peninsula of newfoundland site of the capital and historical early settlement since 2006 the population of the province has started to increase for the

canadian dollars for many years newfoundland and labrador had experienced a depressed economy following the collapse of the cod fishery during the early 1990s the province suffered record unemployment rates and the population decreased by roughly 60000 due to a major energy and resources boom the provincial economy has had a major turnaround since the turn of the 21st century unemployment rates decreased the population stabilized and had moderate growth the province has gained record surpluses which has rid it of its status as a have not province economic growth gross domestic product gdp

tentative agreement to expand the hibernia oil field the government negotiated a 10-per-cent equity stake in the hibernia south expansion which will add an estimated 10billion to newfoundland and labradors treasury the fishing industry remains an important part of the provincial economy employing roughly 20000 and contributing over 440million to the gdp the combined harvest of fish such as cod haddock halibut herring and mackerel was 150000tonnes 165000tons valued at about 130million in 2006 shellfish such as crab shrimp and clams accounted for 195000tonnes 215000tons with a value of

steelhead trout worth over 50million newsprint is produced by one paper mill in corner brook with a capacity of 420000tonnes 462000tons per year the value of newsprint exports varies greatly from year to year depending on the global market price lumber is produced by numerous mills in newfoundland apart from seafood processing paper manufacture and oil refining manufacturing in the province consists of smaller industries producing food brewing and other beverage production agriculture in newfoundland is limited to areas south of st johns cormack wooddale areas near musgravetown and in the codroy valley potatoes rutabagas turnips carrots and cabbage are grown for local consumption poultry and eggs are also produced wild blueberries partridgeberries lingonberries and bakeapples cloudberries are harvested commercially and used in jams and wine making dairy production is another huge part of the newfoundland agriculture industry tourism is also a significant contributor to the provinces economy in 2006 nearly 500000 non-resident tourists visited newfoundland and labrador spending an estimated 366million tourism is most popular throughout the months of juneseptember the warmest months of the year with the longest hours of daylight government and politics newfoundland and labrador is governed by a parliamentary government within the construct of constitutional

election the new democratic party which had only ever attained minor success had a major breakthrough and placed second in the popular vote behind the progressive conservatives culture art before 1950 the formal visual arts were a minor aspect of newfoundland cultural life compared to the performing arts such as music or theatre until about 1900 most art was the work of visiting artists who included members of the group of seven rockwell kent and eliot ohara artists such as newfoundland-born maurice cullen and robert pilot travelled to europe to study art in prominent ateliers by the turn of the century amateur art was made by people living and working in the province these artists included jw hayward and his son thomas b hayward agnes marian ayre and harold b goodridge the last of whom worked on a number of mural commissions notably one for the lobby of the confederation building in st johns local art societies became prominent in the 1940s particularly the art students club which opened in 1940 after newfoundland and labrador joined canada in 1949 government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists primarily painters the visual arts of the province
