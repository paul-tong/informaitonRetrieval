a cold front is the leading edge of a cooler mass of air replacing at ground level a warmer mass of air which lies within a fairly sharp surface trough of low pressure it forms in the wake of an extratropical cyclone at the leading edge of its cold air advection pattern which is also known as the cyclones dry conveyor belt circulation temperature changes across the boundary can exceed 30c 54f when enough moisture is present rain can occur along the boundary if there is significant instability along the boundary a narrow line of thunderstorms can form along the frontal zone if instability is less a broad shield of rain can move in behind the front which increases the temperature difference across the boundary cold fronts are stronger in the fall and spring transition seasons and weakest during the summer development of cold fronts the cooler and denser air wedges under the less-dense warmer air lifting it this upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front and can cause the formation of a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms when enough moisture is present on weather maps the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of trianglesspikes pips pointing in the direction of travel a cold fronts location is at the leading edge of the temperature drop off which in an isotherm analysis would show up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough cold fronts move faster than warm fronts and can produce sharper changes in weather since cold air is denser than warm air it rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary in the northern hemisphere a cold front usually causes a shift of wind from southwest to northwest clockwise also known as veering and in the southern hemisphere a shift from northwest to southwest anticlockwise backing normally cold fronts can be marked by these characteristics provided there is sufficient moisture clouds if the cold front is highly unstable cumulonimbus clouds producing thunderstorms commonly form along the front anvil cirrus clouds may spread a considerable distance downwind from the thunderstorms the other cloud types associated with a cold front depend on atmospheric conditions such as air mass stability and wind shear as the front approaches middle-tage gives way to altostratus and low-level stratocumulus with intermittent light precipitation if the warm airmass being displaced by the cold front is mostly stable with significant airmass instability vertically developed cumulus or cumulonimbus with showers and thunderstorms will form along the front after the passage of the cold front the sky usually clears as high pressure builds in behind the system although significant amounts of cumulus or stratocumulus often in the form of long bands called cloud streets may persist if the air mass behind the front remains humid small and unchanging amounts of cumulus or cirrus clouds in an otherwise clear sky are usually indications of continuing fair weather as long as the barometric pressure remains comparatively high precipitation a cold front commonly brings a narrow band of precipitation that follows along the leading edge of the cold front these bands of precipitation are often very strong and can bring severe thunderstorms hailstorms snow squalls andor tornadoes in the spring these cold fronts can be very strong and can bring strong winds when the pressure gradient is higher than normal during the winter months cold fronts sometimes come through an area with little or no precipitation wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts which tend to have more stratiform and less convective precipitation these rainstorms sometimes bring flooding and can move very slowly when the storm steering it is strong and embedded within a meridional flow pattern with more pole to equator motion rather than west to east motion in the winter cold fronts can bring cold spells and occasionally snow in the spring or summer in temperate latitudes hail may occasionally fall along with the rain if moisture is not sufficient such as when a system has previously moved across a mountain barrier cold fronts can pass without cloudiness frontogenetical circulation frontogenesis is the process of creating or steepening the temperature gradient of a front during this process the atmosphere reacts in an attempt to restore balance the consequence is a circular motion along the front where air is being lifted up along the cold front and dropping downward behind the frontal boundary this is the actual force of upward motion along a front that is responsible for clouds and precipitation as the temperature gradient steepens during frontogenesis the thermal wind becomes imbalanced to maintain balance the geostrophic wind aloft and below adjust such that regions of divergenceconvergence form mass continuity would require a vertical transport of air along the cold front where there is divergence lowered pressure although this circulation is described by a series of processes they are actually occurring at the same time observable along the front as a thermally direct circulation there are several factors that influence the final shape and tilt of the circulation around the front ultimately determining the kind and location of clouds and precipitation temperature changes cold fronts are the leading edge of cooler air masses hence the name cold front they have stronger temperature changes during the fall autumn and spring and during the middle of winter temperature changes associated with cold fronts can be as much as 50f 30c when cold fronts come through there is usually a quick yet strong gust of wind that shows that the cold front is passing in surface weather observations a remark known as fropa is coded when this occurs the effects from a cold front can last from hours to days the air behind the front is cooler than the air it is replacing and the warm air is forced to rise so it cools as the cooler air cannot hold as much moisture as warm air clouds form and rain occurs characteristics of boundaries around an extratropical cyclone cold fronts form when a cooler air mass moves into an area of warmer air in the wake of a developing extratropical cyclone the warmer air interacts with the cooler air mass along the boundary and usually produces precipitation cold fronts often follow a warm front or squall line very commonly cold fronts have a warm front ahead but with a perpendicular orientation in areas where cold fronts catch up to the warm front the occluded front develops occluded fronts have an area of warm air aloft when such a feature forms poleward of an extratropical cyclone it is known as a trowal which is short for trough of warm air aloft a cold front is considered a warm front if it begins to retreat ahead of the next extratropical cyclone along the frontal boundary and called a stationary front if it stalls see also air mass blue norther weather cold wave surface weather analysis weather front cold front transition zone from warm air to cold air weather fronts fronts the boundaries
