this is a list of human spaceflight programs including successful programs programs that were canceled and programs planned for the future the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary the fai defines spaceflight as any flight over 100 kilometers 62mi in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 80 kilometers 50mi are awarded astronaut wings this article follows the fai definition of spaceflight until the 21st century human spaceflight programs were sponsored exclusively by governments through either the military or civilian space agencies with the launch of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of human spaceflight programs commercial human spaceflight arrived successful programs programs in this section are sorted by the years when the first successful crewed spaceflight took place vostok program ussr 19561964 the vostok program was a project that succeeded in putting a person into orbit for the first time sergei korolev and konstantin feoktistov began in june 1956 manned spacecraft research the program developed the vostok spacecraft from the zenit spy satellite project and adapted the vostok rocket from an existing icbm design just before the first release of the name vostok to the press it was a classified word by augustseptember 1958 a division had been formed devoted to producing the first vostok craft the official approval decree for the vostok was delayed until 22 may 1959 by competition with photo reconnaissance programs vostok 1 was the first human spaceflight the vostok 3ka spacecraft was launched on april 12 1961 taking into space yuri gagarin a cosmonaut from the soviet union the vostok 1 mission was the first time anyone had journeyed into outer space and the first time anyone had entered into orbit there were six vostok flights in total another seven vostok flights vostok 7 to 13 were originally planned going through to april 1966 but these were canceled and the components recycled into the voskhod program which was intended to achieve more soviet firsts in space project mercury usa 19591963 project mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the united states it ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the earth the mercury-atlas 6 flight on 20 february 1962 was the first mercury flight to achieve this goal early planning and research was carried out by the national advisory committee for aeronautics and the program was officially conducted by the newly created nasa because of their small size it was said that the mercury spacecraft capsules were worn not ridden with 17 cubic meters of habitable volume the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member inside were 120 controls 55 electrical switches 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers the spacecraft was designed by max faget and nasas space task group nasa ordered 20 production spacecraft numbered 1 through 20 from mcdonnell aircraft company st louis missouri five of the twenty spacecraft 10 12 15 17 and 19 were not flown spacecraft 3 and 4 were destroyed during unmanned test flights spacecraft 11 sank and was recovered from the bottom of the atlantic ocean after 38 years some spacecraft were modified after initial production refurbished after launch abort modified for longer missions etc and received a letter designation after their number examples 2a 15b some spacecraft were modified twice for example spacecraft 15 became 15a and then 15b north american x-15 usa 19541968 the north american x-15 rocket-powered aircraft was part of the x-series of experimental aircraft initiated with the bell x-1 that were made for the usaf nasa and the usn the x-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design it currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a manned aircraft during the x-15 program 13 of the flights by eight pilots met the usaf spaceflight criteria by exceeding the altitude of 50miles 8047km 264000ft thus qualifying the pilots for astronaut status some pilots also qualified for nasa astronaut wings voskhod program ussr 19641965 the voskhod program russian ascent dawn was a soviet human spaceflight project voskhod development was both a follow-on to the vostok program recycling components left over from that programs cancellation following its first six flights the two missions flown used the voskhod spacecraft and rocket the voskhod spacecraft was basically a vostok spacecraft that had a backup solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module the heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the r-7 semyorka-derived booster the ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the vostok crew position however the position of the in-flight controls was not changed so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments while the vostok program was dedicated more towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body voskhods two flights were more aimed towards spectacular firsts although achieving the first eva spacewalk became the main success of the program beating the us gemini project to put the first multi-person crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the program once both goals were realized the program was abandoned this followed the change in soviet leadership which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights and allowed the soviet designers to concentrate on the soyuz program project gemini usa 19651966 project gemini was the second human spaceflight program of the national aeronautics and space administration it operated between projects mercury and apollo with 10 manned flights occurring in 1965 and 1966 its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel notably those necessary for project apollo whose objective was to land humans on the moon gemini missions included the first american extravehicular activity and new orbital maneuvers including rendezvous and docking gemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the mercury program and thus early on was called mercury mark ii the actual program had little in common with mercury and was superior to even apollo in some ways this was mainly a result of its late start date which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the apollo project which despite its later launch dates was actually begun before gemini of all the x-15 missions two flights by joseph a walker in 1963 qualified as space flights per the international fai definition of a spaceflight by exceeding a 100kilometer 62137mi 328084ft altitude soyuz program ussrrussia 1967ongoing the soyuz program russian pronouncedsjus meaning union is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the soviet union in early 1967 it was originally part of a moon landing program intended to put a soviet cosmonaut on the moon all experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series kosmos and flights of the lunar orbital ships around the moon the name zond both the soyuz spacecraft and the soyuz rocket are part of this program which is now the responsibility of the russian federal space agency the basic soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects many of which never came to light its earliest form was intended to travel to the moon without employing a huge booster like the saturn v or the soviet n-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the soyuz this and the initial civilian designs were done under the soviet chief designer sergei pavlovich korolev who did not live to see the craft take flight several military derivatives actually took precedence in the soviet design process though they never came to pass the launch vehicles used in the soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the progress state research and production rocket space center tsskb-progress in samara russia as well as being used in the soyuz program as the launcher for the manned soyuz spacecraft soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch unmanned progress supply spacecraft to the international space station and commercial launches marketed and operated by tsskb-progress and the starsem company there were 11 soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002 currently soyuz vehicles are launched from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and the plesetsk cosmodrome in northwest russia since 2009 soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the guiana space centre in french guiana project apollo usa 19611975 apollo was a program undertaken by nasa during the years 19611975 with the goal of conducting manned moon landing missions in 1961 president john f kennedy announced a goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade it was accomplished on july 20 1969 by the landing of astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin with michael collins orbiting above during the apollo 11 mission five other apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last one in 1972 these six apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another celestial body apollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by nasa the space agency of the united states it used apollo spacecraft and saturn launch vehicles which were later used for the skylab program and the joint american-soviet apollo-soyuz test project these later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall apollo program the goal of the program as articulated by president kennedy was accomplished with only two major failures the first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee in the apollo 1 launchpad fire the second was an in-space explosion on apollo 13 which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey the three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives thanks to the efforts of flight controllers project engineers backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves space shuttle usa 19722011 nasas space shuttle officially called space transportation system sts is the united states governments most recent manned launch vehicle and is retired from service as of 2011 the winged space shuttle orbiter is launched vertically usually carrying five to seven astronauts although eight have been carried and up to 50000lb 22700kg of payload into low earth orbit when its mission is complete the shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines thus slowing it down and re-enter the earths atmosphere during descent and landing the orbiter acts as a glider and makes a completely unpowered landing the shuttle is the only winged manned spacecraft to achieve orbit and land and the only reusable space vehicle that has ever made multiple flights into orbit its missions involve carrying large payloads to various orbits including segments to be added to the international space station providing crew rotation for the international space station and performing service missions the orbiter can also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to earth but its use in this capacity is rare however the shuttle has previously been used to return large payloads from the iss to earth as the russian soyuz spacecraft has limited capacity for return payloads each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years operational life shenzhou programme china 1992ongoing the shenzhou program chinese pinyin shn zhu is a manned spaceflight initiative by the peoples republic of china the program put the first chinese citizen into orbit on 15 october 2003 development began in 1992 under the name of project 921-1 the chinese national manned space program was given the designation project 921 with project 921-1 as its first significant goal the plan called for a manned launch in october 1999 prior to the new millennium the first four unmanned test flights happened in 1999 2001 and 2002 these were followed with three manned launches in 2003 2005 and 2008 unmanned and manned launches to test docking occurred in 2011 and 2012 respectively it is launched on the long march 2f from the jiuquan satellite launch center the command center of the mission is the beijing aerospace command and control center the name is variously translated as divine craft divine vessel or similar but is

was the first space station program undertaken by the soviet union which consisted of a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years from 1971 to 1986 two other salyut launches failed salyut was on the one hand designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical biological and earth-resources experiments and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military almaz stations which flew under the salyut designation salyut 1 the first station in the program became the worlds first crewed space station salyut broke several spaceflight records including several mission duration records the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another and various spacewalk records salyut 1dos-1 1971 1 crew and 1 failed docking salyut 2almazops-1 1973 failed shortly after launch salyut

77t three manned missions to the station conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the apollo commandservice module csm atop the smaller saturn ib each delivered a three-astronaut crew on the last two manned missions an additional apollo saturn ib stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed mir ussrrussia 19862001 mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986to1996 it had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft until 21 march 2001 it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit succeeded by the international space station after mirs orbit decayed the station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology human biology physics astronomy meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3644 days until 23 october 2010 when it was surpassed by the iss it holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight with valeri polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995 mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan having the capacity to support a resident crew of three or larger crews for short term visits mir had 28 long duration crews international space station usa russia japan europe canada 1998ongoing the international space station iss is a space station in low earth orbit
