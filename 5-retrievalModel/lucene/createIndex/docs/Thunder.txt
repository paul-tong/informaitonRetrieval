thunder is the sound caused by lightning depending on the distance from and nature of the lightning it can range from a sharp loud crack to a long low rumble brontide the sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning in turn this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave similar to a sonic boom often referred to as a thunderclap or peal of thunder cause the cause of thunder has been the subject of centuries of speculation and scientific inquiry the first recorded theory is attributed to the greek philosopher aristotle in the fourth century bc and an early speculation was that it was caused by the collision of clouds subsequently numerous other theories were proposed by the mid-19th century the accepted theory was that lightning produced a vacuum in the 20th century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a shock wave in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the plasma in the lightning channel the temperature inside the lightning channel measured by spectral analysis varies during its 50 s existence rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20000k to about 30000k then dropping away gradually to about 10000k the average is about 20400k 20100c 36300f this heating causes a rapid outward expansion impacting the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would otherwise travel the resultant outward-moving pulse is a shock wave similar in principle to the shock wave formed by an explosion or at the front of a supersonic aircraft experimental studies of simulated lightning have produced results largely consistent with this model though there is continued debate about the precise physical mechanisms of the process other causes have also been proposed relying on electrodynamic effects of the massive current acting on the plasma in the bolt of lightning the shockwave in thunder is sufficient to cause injury such as internal contusion to individuals nearby inversion thunder results when lightning strikes between cloud and ground occur during a temperature inversion in such an inversion the air near the ground is cooler than the higher air the sound energy is prevented from dispersing vertically as it would in a non-inversion and is thus concentrated in the near-ground layer inversions often occur when warm moist air passes above a cold front the resulting thunder sound is significantly louder than it would be if heard at the same distance in a non-inversion condition etymology the d in modern english thunder from earlier old english unor is epenthetic and is now found as well in modern dutch donder cp middle dutch donre and old norse orr old frisian uner old high german donar descended from proto-germanic unraz in latin the term was tonare to thunder the name of the nordic god thor comes from the old norse word for thunder the shared proto-indo-european root is tn-r or tar- also found gaulish taranis and hittite tarhunt distance calculation a flash of lightning followed after some time by a rumble of thunder illustrates the fact that sound travels significantly slower than light using this difference one can estimate how far away the bolt of lightning is by timing the interval between seeing the flash and hearing thunder the speed of sound in dry air is approximately 343ms or 1127fts or 768mph 1236kmh at 20c 68f this translates to approximately 3 seconds per kilometer or 5 seconds per mile saying one-mississippi two-mississippi or one one-thousand two one-thousand is a useful method of counting the seconds from the perception of a given lightning flash to the perception of its thunder which can be used to gauge the proximity of lightning for the sake of safety the speed of light is high enough that it can be taken as infinite in this calculation because of the relatively small distance involved therefore the lightning is approximately one kilometer distant for every three seconds that elapse between the visible flash and the first sound of thunder or one mile for every five seconds in the same five seconds the light could have traveled the lunar distance four times in this calculation the initial shock wave which travels at a rate faster than the speed of sound but only extends outward for the first 30 feet 9m is ignored thunder is seldom heard at distances over 20 kilometers 12mi a very bright flash of lightning and an almost simultaneous sharp crack of thunder a thundercrack therefore indicates that the lightning strike was very near see also thunderbolt thunderstorm brontophobia fear of thunder castle thunder sound effect lightning list of thunder gods mistpouffers media related to thunder at wikimedia commons the science of thunder thunder a child of lightning wikibooks engineering acousticsthunder acoustics
