the interplanetary dust cloud or zodiacal cloud consists of cosmic dust small particles floating in outer space that pervades the space between planets within planetary systems such as the solar system this system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature origin and relationship to larger bodies in our solar system the interplanetary dust particles have a role in scattering sunlight and in emitting thermal radiation which is the most prominent feature of the night skys radiation with wavelengths ranging 550 m the particle sizes of grains characterizing the infrared emission near earths orbit typically range 10100 m the total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an asteroid of radius 15 km with density of about 25 gcm straddling the zodiac along the ecliptic this dust cloud is visible as the zodiacal light in a moonless and naturally dark sky and is best seen toward the suns direction during astronomical twilight the pioneer spacecraft observations in the 1970s linked the zodiacal light with the interplanetary dust cloud in earths solar system origin the sources of interplanetary dust particles idps include at least asteroid collisions cometary activity and collisions in the inner solar system kuiper belt collisions and interstellar medium grains backman d 1997 indeed one of the longest-standing controversies debated in the interplanetary dust community revolves around the relative contributions to the interplanetary dust cloud from asteroid collisions and cometary activity life cycle of a particle the main physical processes affecting destruction or expulsion mechanisms interplanetary dust particles are expulsion by radiation pressure inward poynting-robertson pr radiation drag solar wind pressure with significant electromagnetic effects sublimation mutual collisions and the dynamical effects of planets backman d 1997 the lifetimes of these dust particles are very short compared to the lifetime of the solar system if one finds grains around a star that is older than about 10000000 years then the grains must have been from recently released fragments of larger objects ie they cannot be leftover grains from the protoplanetary disk backman private communication therefore the grains would be later-generation dust the zodiacal dust in the solar system is 999 later-generation dust and 01 intruding interstellar medium dust all primordial grains from the solar systems formation were removed long ago particles which are affected primarily by radiation pressure are known as beta meteoroids they are generally less than 14 10g and are pushed outward from the sun into interstellar space cloud structures the interplanetary dust cloud has a complex structure reach w 1997 apart from a background density this includes at least 8 dust trailstheir source is thought to be short-period comets a number of dust bands the sources of which are thought to be asteroid families in the main asteroid belt the three strongest bands arise from the themis family the koronis family and the eos family other source families include the maria eunomia and possibly the vesta andor hygiea families reach et al 1996 at least 2 resonant dust rings are known for example the earth-resonant dust ring although every planet in the solar system is thought to have a resonant ring with a wake jackson and zook 1988 1992 dermott sf et al 1994 1997 dust collection on earth in 1951 fred whipple predicted that micrometeorites smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter might be decelerated on impact with the earths upper atmosphere without melting the modern era of laboratory study of these particles began with the stratospheric collection flights of d e brownlee and collaborators in the 1970s using balloons and then u-2 aircraft although some of the particles found were similar to the material in present-day meteorite collections the nanoporous nature and unequilibrated cosmic-average composition of other particles suggested that they began as fine-grained aggregates of nonvolatile building blocks and cometary ice the interplanetary nature of these particles was later verified by noble gas and solar flare track observations in that context a program for atmospheric collection and curation of these particles was developed at johnson space center in texas this stratospheric micrometeorite collection along with presolar grains from meteorites are unique sources of extraterrestrial material not to mention being small astronomical objects in their own right
