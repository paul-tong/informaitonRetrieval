pytheas of massalia pis ancient greek pythas ho massalits latin pytheas massiliensis fl 4th century bc was a greek geographer and explorer from the greek colony of massalia modern-day marseille france he made a voyage of exploration to northwestern europe in about 325bc but his account of it known widely in antiquity has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others on this voyage he circumnavigated and visited a considerable part of great britain he was the first known scientific visitor to see and describe the arctic polar ice and the germanic tribes he is also the first person on record to describe the midnight sun the theoretical existence of some northern phenomena that he described such as a frigid zone and temperate zones where the nights are very short in summer and the sun does not set at the summer solstice was already known similarly reports of a country of perpetual snow and darkness the country of the hyperboreans had reached the mediterranean some centuries before pytheas introduced the idea of distant thule to the geographic imagination and his account of the tides is the earliest one known that suggests the moon as their cause he also may have reached iceland dates pliny says that timaeus born about 350 bc believed pytheas story of the discovery of amber first century bc strabo says that dicaearchus died about 285bc did not trust the stories of pytheas that is all the information that survives concerning the date of pytheas voyage presuming that timaeus would not have written until after he was 20 years old in about 330bc and dicaearchus would have needed time to write his most mature work after 300bc there is no reason not to accept henry fanshawe tozers interval of 330300bc for the voyage some would give timaeus an extra 5years bringing the voyage to 325bc at earliest there is no further evidence if one presumes that pytheas would not have written before reaching age 20 he would have been a contemporary and competitor of timaeus and dicaearchus as they read his writings he must have written toward the earlier years of the interval record pytheas described his travels in a work that has not survived only excerpts remain quoted or paraphrased by later authors most familiarly in strabos geographica plinys natural history and passages in diodorus of sicilys history most of the ancients including the first two just mentioned refer to his work by his name pytheas says two late writers give titles the astronomical author geminus of rhodes mentions ta peri tou okeanou literally things about the ocean sometimes translated as description of the ocean on the ocean or ocean marcianus the scholiast on apollonius of rhodes mentions periodos gs a trip around the earth or periplous sail around scholars of the 19th century tended to interpret these titles as the names of distinct works covering separate voyages for example smiths dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology hypothesizes a voyage to britain and thule written about in ocean and another from cadiz to the don river written about in sail around as is common with ancient texts multiple titles may represent a single source for example if a title refers to a section rather than the whole presently periplus is recognized as a genre of navigational literature mainstream consensus is that there was only one work on the ocean which was based on a periplus diodorus does not mention pytheas by name the association is made as follows pliny reports that timaeus says there is an island named mictis where tin is found and to which the britons cross diodorus says that tin is brought to the island of ictis where there is an emporium the last link is supplied by strabo who says that an emporium on the island of corbulo in the mouth of the river loire was associated with the britain of pytheas by polybius assuming that ictis mictis and corbulo are the same diodorus appears to have read timaeus who must have read pytheas whom polybius also read circumstances of the voyage pytheas was the first documented mediterranean mariner to reach the british isles the start of pytheass voyage is unknown the carthaginians had closed the strait of gibraltar to all ships from other nations some historians mainly of the late 19th century and before therefore speculated without any evidence that he must have traveled overland to the mouth of the loire or the garonne others believed that to avoid the carthaginian blockade he may have stayed close to land and sailed only at night or taken advantage of a temporary lapse in the blockade an alternate theory is that by the 4th century bc the western greeks especially the massaliotes were on amicable terms with carthage in 348bc carthage and rome came to terms over the sicilian wars with a treaty defining their mutual interests rome could use sicilian markets carthage could buy and sell goods at rome and slaves taken by carthage from allies of rome were to be set free rome was to stay out of the western mediterranean but these terms did not apply to massalia which had its own treaty during the second half of the 4th century bc the time of pytheas voyage massaliotes were presumably free to operate as they pleased there is at least no evidence of conflict with carthage in any of the sources that mention the voyage the early part of pytheas voyage is outlined by statements of eratosthenes that strabo says are false because taken from pytheas apparently pytheas said that tides ended at the sacred promontory hieron akrtrion or sagres point and from there to gades is said to be 5days sail strabo complains about this distance and about pytheas portrayal of the exact location of tartessos mention of these places in a journal of the voyage indicates that pytheas passed through the straits of gibraltar and sailed north along the coast of portugal discovery of britain the circumnavigation strabo reports that pytheas says he travelled over the whole of britain that was accessible the word epelthein at root come upon does not imply any specific method and pytheas does not elaborate he does use the word whole and he states a perimetros perimeter of more than 40000stadia using herodotus standard of 600 feet 180m for one stadium gives 4545 miles 7314km however there is no way to tell which standard foot was in effect the english foot is an approximation strabo wants to discredit pytheas on the grounds that 40000stadia is outrageously high and cannot be real diodorus siculus gives a similar number 42500 stadia about 4830 miles 7770km and explains that it is the perimeter of a triangle around britain the consensus has been that he probably took his information from pytheas through timaeaus pliny gives the circuitus reported by pytheas as 4875roman miles the explorer fridtjof nansen explains this apparent fantasy of pytheas as a mistake of timaeus strabo and diodorus siculus never saw pytheas work says nansen but they and others read of him in timaeus pytheas reported only days sail timaeus converted days to stadia at the rate of 1000 per day a standard figure of the times however pytheas only sailed 560stadia per day for a total of 23800 which in nansens view is consistent with 700stadia per degree nansen later states that pytheas must have stopped to obtain astronomical data presumably the extra time was spent ashore using the stadia of diodorus siculus one obtains 425days for the time that would be spent in circumnavigating britain it may have been a virtual circumnavigation see under thule below the perimeter according to nansen based on the 23800 stadia was 2375 miles 3822km this number is in the neighborhood of what a triangular perimeter ought to be but it cannot be verified against anything pytheas may have said nor is diodorus siculus very precise about the locations of the legs the perimeter is often translated as coastline but this translation is misleading the coastline following all the bays and inlets is 7723 miles 12429km see geography of the united kingdom pytheas could have travelled any perimeter between that number and diodorus polybius adds that pytheas said he traversed the whole of britain on foot of which he polybius is skeptical despite strabos conviction of a lie the perimeter said to have been given by pytheas is not evidence of it the issue of what he did say can never be settled until more fragments of pytheas literature are found name and description of the british the first known written use of the word britain is one of its uses was an ancient greek transliteration of the original p-celtic term it is believed to have appeared within a periplus by the geographer and explorer pytheas of massalia but no copies of this work survive the earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors such as those within strabos geographica plinys natural history and diodorus of sicilys bibliotheca historica according to strabo pytheas referred to britain as bretannik which is treated a feminine noun britain is most like welsh ynys prydein the island of britain in which is a p-celtic allophone of q-celtic cruithne in irish cruithen-tuath land of the picts the base word is scottishirish cruth welsh pryd meaning form the british were the people of forms with the sense of shapes or pictures thought to refer to their practice of tattooing or war painting the roman word picti the picts means painted this etymology shows that pytheas interacted not so much with irish or scots as they used q-celtic rather pytheas brought back the p-celtic form from more geographically accessible regions where welsh or breton are spoken presently furthermore some proto-celtic was spoken over all of greater britain and this particular spelling is prototypical of those more populous regions diodorus based on pytheas reports that britain is cold and subject to frosts being too much subject to the bear and not under the arctic pole as some translations say the numerous population of natives he says live in thatched cottages store their grain in subterranean caches and bake bread from it they are of simple manners thesin haplous and are content with plain fare they are ruled by many kings and princes who live in peace with each other their troops fight from chariots as did the greeks in the trojan war the three corners of britain kantion belerion and orkas opposite europe in diodorus is the promontory akrtrion of kantion kent 100 stadia about 11 miles 18km from the land but the text is ambiguous the land could be either britain or the continent four days sail beyond that is another promontory belerion which can only be cornwall as diodorus is describing the triangular perimeter and the third point is orkas presumably the main island of the orkney islands the tin trade the inhabitants of cornwall are involved in the manufacture of tin ingots they mine the ore smelt it and then work it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones after which it is transported to the island of ictis by wagon which can be done at low tide merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river rhne where it is carried down to the mouth diodorus says that the inhabitants of cornwall are civilised in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants discovery of thule strabo relates taking his text from polybius pytheas asserts that he explored in person the whole northern region of europe as far as the ends of the world strabo does not believe it but he explains what pytheas means by the ends of the world thoul he says now spelled thule pliny the elder uses tyle vergil references ultima thule in georgic i line 30 where the ultima refer to the end of the world is the most northerly of the british isles there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the arctic circle see below on arctic circle moreover says strabo none of the other authors mention thule a fact which he uses to discredit pytheas but which to moderns indicates pytheas was the first explorer to arrive there and tell of it thule is described as an island six days sailing north of britain near the frozen sea pepguia thalatta solidified sea pliny adds that it has no nights at midsummer when the sun is passing through the sign of the crab at the summer solstice a reaffirmation that it is on the arctic circle he adds that the crossing to thule starts at the island of berrice the largest of all which may be lewis in the outer hebrides if berrice was in the outer hebrides the crossing would have brought pytheas to the coast of mre og romsdal or trndelag norway explaining how he managed to miss the skagerrak if this is his route in all likelihood he did not actually circumnavigate britain but returned along the coast of germany accounting for his somewhat larger perimeter concerning the location of thule a discrepancy in data caused subsequent geographers some problems and may be responsible for ptolemys distortion of scotland strabo reports that eratosthenes places thule at a parallel 11500stadia 1305miles or 164 north of the mouth of the borysthenes the parallel running through that mouth also passes through celtica and is pytheas base line using 3700 or 3800 stadia approximately 420430miles or 5354 north of marseilles for a base line obtains a latitude of 648 or 649 for thule well short of the arctic circle it is in fact the latitude of trondheim where pytheas may have made land a statement by geminus of rhodes quotes on the ocean as saying the barbarians showed us the place where the sun goes to rest for it was the case that in these parts the nights were very short in some places two in others three hours long so that the sun rose again a short time after it had set nansen claimed that according to this statement pytheas was there in person and that the 21- and 22-hour days must be the customary statement of latitude by length of longest day he calculates the latitudes to be 6432 and 6531 partially confirming hipparchus statement of the latitude of thule and yet strabo says pytheas of massalia tells us that thule is farthest north and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the arctic circle eratosthenes extends the latitudinal distance from massalia to celtica to 5000 stadia 71 placing the base line in normandy the northernmost location cited in britain at the firth of clyde is now northern scotland to get this country south of britain to conform to strabos interpretation of pytheas ptolemy has to rotate scotland by 90 the 5000 stadia must be discounted it crosses the borysthenes upriver near kiev rather than at the mouth it does place pytheas on the arctic circle which in norway is south of the lofoten islands it seems that eratosthenes altered the base line to pass through the northern extreme of celtica pytheas as related by hipparchus probably cited the place in celtica where he first made land if he used the same practice in norway thule is at least somewhere on the entire northwest coast of norway from mre og romsdal to the lofoten islands the explorer richard francis burton in his study of thule states that it has had many definitions over the centuries many more authors have written about it than remembered pytheas the question of the location of pytheas thule remains the latitudes given by the ancient authors can be reconciled the missing datum required to fix the location is longitude manifestly we cannot rely upon the longitude pytheas crossed the waters northward from berrice in the north of the british isles but whether to starboard larboard or straight ahead is not known from the time of the roman empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers iceland shetland the faroe islands norway and later greenland a manuscript variant of a name in pliny has abetted the iceland theory nerigon instead of berrice which sounds like norway if one sails west from norway one encounters iceland burton himself espoused this theory the standard texts have berrice presently as well as bergos for vergos in the same list of islands the scandiae islands are more of a problem as they could be scandinavia but other islands had that name as well moreover procopius says de bello gothico chapter 15 that the earlier name of scandinavia was thule and that it was the home of the goths the fact that pytheas returned from the vicinity of the baltic favors procopiuss opinion the fact that pytheas lived centuries before the colonization of iceland and greenland by european agriculturalists makes them less likely candidates as he stated that thule was populated and its soil was tilled concerning the people of thule strabo says of pytheas but grudgingly he might possibly seem to have made adequate use of the facts as regards the people who live close to the frozen zone when he says that the people live on millet and other herbs and on fruits and roots and where there are grain and honey the people get their beverage also from them as for the grain he says since they have no pure sunshine they pound it out in large storehouses after first gathering in the ears thither for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains what he seems to be describing is an agricultural country that uses barns for threshing grain rather than the mediterranean outside floor of sun-baked mud and manufactures a drink possibly mead encounter with drift ice after mentioning the crossing navigatio from berrice to tyle pliny makes a brief statement that a tyle unius diei navigatione mare concretum a nonnullis cronium appellatur one days sail from thule is the frozen ocean called by some the cronian sea the mare concretum appears to match strabos pepguia thalatta and is probably the same as the topoi places mentioned in strabos apparent description of spring drift ice which would have stopped his voyage further north and was for him the ultimate limit of the world strabo says pytheas also speaks of the waters around thule and of those places where land properly speaking no longer exists nor sea nor air but a mixture of these things like a marine lung in which it is said that earth and water and all things are in suspension as if this something was a link between all these elements on which one can neither walk nor sail the term used for marine lung pleumn thalattios appears to refer to jellyfish of the type the ancients called sea-lung the latter are mentioned by aristotle in on the parts of animals as being free-floating and insensate they are not further identifiable from what aristotle says but some pulmones appear in pliny as a class of insensate sea animal specifically the halipleumon salt-water lung william ogle a major translator and annotator of aristotle attributes the name sea-lung to the lung-like expansion and contraction of the medusae a kind of cnidaria during locomotion the ice resembled floating circles in the water the modern english term for this phenomenon is pancake ice the association of pytheas observations with drift ice has long been standard in navigational literature including nathaniel bowditchs american practical navigator which begins chapter 33 ice navigation with pytheas at its edge sea slush and ice mix surrounded by fog discovery of the baltic strabo says that pytheas gave an account of what is beyond the rhine as far as scythia which he strabo thinks is false in the geographers of the late roman republic and early roman empire such as ptolemy scythia stretches eastward from the mouth of the river vistula thus pytheas must have described the germanic coast of the baltic sea if the statement is true there are no other possibilities as to whether he explored it in person he said that he explored the entire north in person see under thule above as the periplus was a sort of ships log he probably did reach the vistula according to the natural history by pliny the elder pytheas says that the gutones a people of germany inhabit the shores of an estuary of the ocean called mentonomon their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia that at one days sail from this territory is the isle of abalus upon the shores of which amber is thrown up by the waves in spring it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form as also that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel and sell it to their neighbours the teutones the gutones is a simplification of two manuscript variants guttonibus and guionibus which would be in the nominative case guttones or guiones the goths in the main opinion the second major manuscript variant is either mentonomon nominative case or metuonidis genitive case a number of etymologies have been proposed but none very well accepted amber is not actually named it is termed the concreti maris purgamentum the frozen seas leavings after the springtime melt diodorus uses lektron the greek word for amber the object that gave its name to electricity through its ability to acquire a charge pliny is presenting an archaic opinion as in his time amber was a precious stone brought from the baltic at great expense but the germans he says use it for firewood according to pytheas mentonomon is unambiguously stated to be an aestuarium or estuary of 6000 stadia which using the herodotean standard of 600 feet 180m per stadium is 681 miles 1096km that number happens to be the distance from the mouth of the skagerrak to the mouth of the vistula but no source says explicitly where the figure was taken competing views however usually have to reinterpret estuary to mean something other than an estuary as the west of the baltic sea is the only body of estuarial water of sufficient length in the region earlier pliny says that a large island of three days sail from the scythian coast called balcia by xenophon of lampsacus is called basilia by pytheas it is generally understood to be the same as abalus based on the amber the island could have been heligoland zealand the shores of bay of gdansk sambia or the curonian lagoon which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern europe this is the earliest use of germania voyage to the don pytheas claimed to have explored the entire north however he turned back at the mouth of the vistula the border with scythia if he had gone on he would have discovered the ancestral balts they occupied the lands to the east of the vistula in the west they began with the people living around frisches haff lithuanian aismars sea of the aistians who in that vicinity became the baltic prussians on the east herodotus called them the neuri a name related to old prussian narus the deep in the sense of water country later lithuanians would be the people of the shore the vistula was the traditional limit of greater germany place names featuring ner- or nar- are wide-ranging over the vast proto-baltic homeland occupying western russia before the slavs herodotus says that the neuri had scythian customs but they were at first not considered scythian during the war between the scythians and the persian empire the scythians came to dominate the neuri strabo denies that any knowledge of the shores of the eastern baltic existed he had heard of the sauromatai but had no idea where to place them herodotus had mentioned these sauromatai as a distinct people living near the neuri pliny the elder however is much better informed the island of baunonia bornholm he says lies a days sail off scythia where amber is collected to him the limit of germany is the vistula in contrast to strabo he knows that the goths live around the vistula but these are definitely germans by the time of tacitus the aestii have emerged the former scythia is now entirely sarmatia evidently the sarmatians have conquered westward to the vistula the goths have moved to the south that the balts lived east of the vistula from remote prehistoric times is unquestioned the baltic languages however are only known from the 2nd millennium ad they are known to have developed in tribal contexts as they were originally tribal the first mention of any tribes is in ptolemys description of european sarmatia where the main prussian tribes are mentioned for the first time in tacitus only the language of the aestii is mentioned strabo distinguishes the venedi who were likely slavs from these few references which are the only surviving evidence apart from glottochronology and place name analysis it would seem that the balts of pytheas time were well past the common balto-slavic stage and likely spoke a number of related dialects by turning back at what he thought was the limit of germany he not only missed the balts but did not discover that more germans the goths had moved into the baltic area polybius relates on his return thence from the north he traversed the whole of the coast of europe from gades to the tanais some authors consider this leg a second voyage as it does not seem likely he would pass by marseilles without refitting and refreshing the crew it is striking that he encountered the border of scythia turned around and went around europe counter-clockwise until he came to the southern side of scythia on the black sea it is possible to speculate that he may have hoped to circumnavigate europe but the sources do not say in other even more speculative interpretations pytheas returned north and the tanais is not the don but is a northern river such as the elbe river measurements of latitude latitude by the altitude of the sun in discussing the work of pytheas strabo typically uses direct discourse pytheas says in presenting his astronomical observations he changes to indirect discourse hipparchus says that pytheas says either because he never read pytheas manuscript because it was not available to him or in deference to hipparchus who appears to have been the first to apply the babylonian system of representing the sphere of the earth by 360 strabo uses the degrees based on hipparchus neither say that pytheas did nevertheless pytheas did obtain latitudes which according to strabo he expressed in proportions of the gnmn index or trigonometric tangents of angles of elevation to celestial bodies they were measured on the gnmn the vertical leg of a right triangle and the flat leg of the triangle the imaginary hypotenuse looked along the line of sight to the celestial body or marked the edge of a shadow cast by the vertical leg on the horizontal leg pytheas took the altitude of the sun at massalia at noon on the longest day of the year and found that the tangent was the proportion of 120 the length of the gnmn to 15 less than 42 the length of the shadow hipparchus relying on the authority of pytheas says strabo states that the ratio is the same as for byzantium and that the two therefore are on the same parallel nansen and others prefer to give the cotangent 209600 which is the inverse of the tangent but the angle is greater than 45 and it is the tangent that strabo states his number system did not permit him to express it as a decimal but the tangent is about287 it is unlikely that any of the geographers could compute the arctangent or angle of that tangent moderns look it up in a table hipparchos is said to have had a table of some angles the altitude or angle of elevation is 704750 but that is not the latitude at noon on the longest day the plane of longitude passing through marseilles is exactly on edge to the sun if the earths axis were not tilted toward the sun a vertical rod at the equator would have no shadow arod further north would have a north-south shadow and as an elevation of 90 would be a zero latitude the complement of the elevation gives the latitude the sun is even higher in the sky due to the tilt the angle added to the elevation by the tilt is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic and at that time was 234440 the complement of the elevation less the obliquity is 4313 only 5 in error from marseilless latitude 4318 latitude by the elevation of the north pole a second method of determining the latitude of the observer measures the angle of elevation of a celestial pole north in the northern hemisphere seen from zero latitude the north poles elevation is zero that is it is a point on the horizon the declination of the observers zenith also is zero and therefore so is their latitude as the observers latitude increases traveling north so does the declination the pole rises over the horizon by an angle of the same amount the elevation at the terrestrial north pole is 90 straight up and the celestial pole has a declination of the same value the latitude also is 90 moderns have polaris to mark the approximate location of the north celestial pole which it does nearly exactly but this position of polaris was not available in pytheas time due to changes in the positions of the stars pytheas reported that the pole was an empty space at the corner of a quadrangle the other three sides of which were marked by stars their identity has not survived but based on calculations these are believed to have been and in draco and in ursa minor pytheas sailed northward with the intent of locating the arctic circle and exploring the frigid zone to the north of it at the extreme of the earth he did not know the latitude of the circle in degrees all he had to go by was the definition of the frigid zone as the latitudes north of the line where the celestial arctic circle was equal to the celestial tropic of cancer the tropikos kuklos refer to the next subsection strabos angular report of this line as being at 24 may well be based on a tangent known to pytheas but he does not say that in whatever mathematical form pytheas knew the location he could only have determined when he was there by taking periodic readings of the elevation of the pole eksarma tou polou in strabo and others today the elevation can be obtained easily on ship with a quadrant electronic navigational systems have made even this simple measure unnecessary longitude was beyond pytheas and his peers but it was not of as great a consequence because ships seldom strayed out of sight of land east-west distance was a matter of contention to the geographers they are one of strabos most frequent topics because of the gnmn north-south distances were accurate often to within a degree it is unlikely that any gnmn could be read accurately on the pitching deck of a small vessel at night pytheas must have made frequent overnight stops to use his gnmn and talk to the natives which would have required interpreters probably acquired along the way the few fragments that have survived indicate that this material was a significant part of the periplus possibly kept as the ships log there is little hint of native hostility the celts and the germans appear to have helped him which suggests that the expedition was put forward as purely scientific in any case all voyages required stops for food water and repairs the treatment of voyagers fell under the special guest ethic for visitors location of the arctic circle the ancient greek view of the heavenly bodies on which their navigation was based was imported from babylonia by the ionian greeks who used it to become a seafaring nation of merchants and colonists during the archaic period in greece massalia was an ionian colony the first ionian philosopher thales was known for his ability to measure the distance of a ship at sea from a cliff by the very method pytheas used to determine the latitude of massalia the trigonometric ratios the astronomic model on which ancient greek navigation was based which is still in place today was already extant in the time of pytheas the concept of the degrees only being missing the model divided the universe into a celestial and an earthly sphere pierced by the same poles each of the spheres were divided into zones zonai by circles kukloi in planes at right angles to the poles the zones of the celestial sphere repeated on a larger scale those of the terrestrial sphere the basis for division into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies that of the stars and that of the sun and moon astronomers know today that the earth revolving around the sun is tilted on its axis bringing each hemisphere now closer to the sun now further away the greeks had the opposite model that the stars and the sun rotated around the earth the stars moved in fixed circles around the poles the sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles which obliquity brought it now to the north now to the south the circle of the sun was the ecliptic it was the center of a band called the zodiac on which various constellations were located the shadow cast by a vertical rod at noon was the basis for defining zonation the intersection of the northernmost or southernmost points of the ecliptic defined the axial circles passing through those points as the two tropics tropikoi kukloi circles at the turning points later named for the zodiacal constellations found there cancer and capricorn during noon of the summer solstice therin trop rods there cast no shadow the latitudes between the tropics were called the torrid zone diakekaumen burned up based on their experience of the torrid zone south of egypt and libya the greek geographers judged it uninhabitable symmetry requires that there be an uninhabitable frigid zone katepsugmen frozen to the north and reports from there since the time of homer seemed to confirm it the edge of the frigid zone ought to be as far south from the north pole in latitude as the summer tropic is from the equator strabo gives it as 24 which may be based on a previous tangent of pytheas but he does not say the arctic circle would then be at 66 accurate to within a degree seen from the equator the celestial north pole boreios polos is a point on the horizon as the observer moves northward the pole rises and the circumpolar stars appear now unblocked by the earth at the tropic of cancer the radius of the circumpolar stars reaches 24 the edge stands on the horizon the constellation of mikra arktos ursa minor little bear was entirely contained within the circumpolar region the latitude was therefore called the arktikos kuklos circle of the bear the terrestrial arctic circle was regarded as fixed at this latitude the celestial arctic circle was regarded as identical to the circumference of the circumpolar stars and therefore a variable when the observer is on the terrestrial arctic circle and the radius of the circumpolar stars is 66 the celestial arctic circle is identical to the celestial tropic of cancer that is what pytheas means when he says that thule is located at the place where the arctic circle is identical to the tropic of cancer at that point on the day of the summer solstice the vertical rod of the gnmn casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360 as the sun does not set under the pole the arctic circle is identical to the equator and the sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon the shadow of the gnmn winds perpetually around it latitude by length of longest day and by suns elevation on shortest day strabo uses the astronomical cubit pchus the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger as a measure of the elevation of the sun the term cubit in this context is obscure it has nothing to do with distance along either a straight line or an arc does not apply to celestial distances and has nothing to do with the gnmn hipparchus borrowed this term from babylonia where it meant 2 they in turn took it from ancient sumer so long ago that if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either babylonia or ionia it did not survive strabo states degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a great circle the greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude it is stated in equinoctial hours hrai ismerinai one being 112 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an equinox based partly on data taken from pytheas hipparchus correlated cubits of the suns elevation at noon on the winter solstice latitudes in hours of a day on the summer solstice and distances between latitudes in stadia for some locations pytheas had proved that marseilles and byzantium were on the same parallel see above hipparchus through strabo adds that byzantium and the mouth of the borysthenes todays dnepr river were on the same meridian and were separated by 3700 stadia 53 at strabos 700stadia per a degree of meridian arc as the parallel through the river-mouth also crossed the coast of celtica the distance due north from marseilles to celtica was 3700 stadia a baseline from which pytheas seems to have calculated latitude and distance strabo says that ierne ireland is under 5000 stadia 71 north of this line these figures place celtica around the mouth of the loire river an emporium for the trading of british tin the part of ireland referenced is the vicinity of belfast pytheas then would either have crossed the bay of biscay from the coast of spain to the mouth of the loire or reached it along the coast crossed the english channel from the vicinity of brest france to cornwall and traversed the irish sea to reach the orkney islands a statement of eratosthenes attributed by strabo to pytheas that the north of the iberian peninsula was an easier passage to celtica than across the ocean is somewhat ambiguous apparently he knew or knew of both routes but he does not say which he took at noon on the winter solstice the sun stands at 9 cubits and the longest day on the summer solstice is 16 hours at the baseline through celtica at 2500stadia approximately 283 miles or 36 north of celtica are a people hipparchus called celtic but whom strabo thinks are the british a discrepancy he might not have noted if he had known that the british were also celtic the location is cornwall the sun stands at 6cubits and the longest day is 17hours at 9100stadia approximately 1032miles north of marseilles 5400 or 77 north of celtica the elevation is 4cubits and the longest day is 18hours this location is in the vicinity of the firth of clyde here strabo launches another quibble hipparchus relying on pytheas according to strabo places this area south of britain but he strabo calculates that it is north of ierne pytheas however rightly knows what is now scotland as part of britain land of the picts even though north of ierne north of southern scotland the longest day is 19 hours strabo based on theory alone states that ierne is so cold that any lands north of it must be uninhabited in the hindsight given to moderns pytheas in relying on observation in the field appears more scientific than strabo who discounted the findings of others merely because of their strangeness to him the ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply that he did not believe scandinavia could exist this disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of pytheas data on the tides pliny reports that pytheas of massalia informs us that in britain the tide rises 80cubits the passage does not give enough information to determine which cubit pliny meant however any cubit gives the same general result if he was reading an early source the cubit may have been the cyrenaic cubit an early greek cubit of 4631mm in which case the distance was 37 metres 121ft this number far exceeds any modern known tides the national oceanography centre which records tides at tidal gauges placed in about 55ports of the uk tide gauge network on an ongoing basis records the highest mean tidal change between 1987 and 2007 at avonmouth in the severn estuary of 6955m 2282ft the highest predicted spring tide between 2008 and 2026 at that location will be 1464m 480ft on 29september2015 even allowing for geologic and climate change pytheas 80 cubits far exceeds any known tides around britain one well-circulated but unevidenced answer to the paradox is that pytheas is referring to a storm surge despite the modern arguments the fact remains that pytheas experienced tides that exceeded by far the usual tides in the mediterranean and particularly those at massilia matching fragments of atius in pseudo-plutarch and stobaeus attribute the flood tides plmmurai to the filling of the moon plrsis ts slns and the ebb tides amptides to the lessening meisis the words are too ambiguous to make an exact determination of pytheas meaning whether diurnal or spring and neap tides are meant or whether full and new moons or the half-cycles in which they occur different translators take different views that daily tides should be caused by full moons and new moons is manifestly wrong which would be a surprising view in a greek astronomer and mathematician of the times he could have meant that spring and neap tides were caused by new and full moons which is partially correct in that spring tides occur at those times a gravitational theory objects fall to the center existed at the time but pytheas appears to have meant that the phases themselves were the causes aitiai however imperfect or imperfectly related the viewpoint pytheas was the first to associate the tides to the phases of the moon literary influence pytheas was a central source of information on the north sea and the subarctic regions of western europe to later periods and possibly the only source the only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw pytheas original text were dicaearchus timaeus eratosthenes crates of mallus hipparchus polybius artemidorus and posidonius notably the list does not include strabo or tacitus though strabo discusses him and tacitus may likely have known about his work either of the two could have known him through other writers or have read his work in the original strabo citing polybius accuses pytheas of promulgating a fictitious journey he could never have funded as he was a private individual idits and a poor man pens markham proposes a possible answer to the funding question seeing that pytheas was known as a professional geographer and that north europe was as yet a question mark to massalian merchants he suggests that the enterprise was a government expedition of which pytheas was placed in command in another suggestion the merchants of marseilles sent him out to find northern markets these theories are speculative but perhaps less so than strabos contention that pytheas was a charlatan just because a professional geographer doubted him strabo does explain his reasons for doubting pytheas veracity citing numerous instances of pytheas apparently being far off the mark on details concerning known regions he says however any man who has told such great falsehoods about the known regions would hardly i imagine be able to tell the truth about places that are not known to anybody as an example he mentions that pytheas says kent is several days sail from celtica when it is visible from gaul across the channel if pytheas had visited the place he should have verified it personally the objection although partially true is itself flawed strabo interjects his own view of the location of celtica that it was opposite to britain end to end pytheas however places it further south around the mouth of the loire see above from which it might justifiably be several days sail the people across from britain in caesars time are the germani in the north and the belgae in the south still some of the celtic lands were on the channel and were visible from it which pytheas should have mentioned but strabo implies he did not strabos other objections are similarly flawed or else completely wrong he simply did not believe the earth was inhabited north of ierne pytheas however could not then answer for himself or protect his own work from loss or alteration so most of the questions concerning his voyage remain unresolved to be worked over by every generation to some he is a daring adventurer and discoverer to others a semi-legendary blunderer or prevaricator the logical outcome of this tendency is the historical novel with pytheas as the main character and the celebration of pytheas in poetry beginning as far back as virgil the process continues into modern times for example pytheas is a key theme in charles olsons maximus poems details of pytheas voyage
