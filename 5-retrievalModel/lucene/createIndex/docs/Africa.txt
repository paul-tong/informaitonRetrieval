africa is the worlds second largest and second most-populous continent being behind asia in both categories at about 303 million km 117 million squaremiles including adjacent islands it covers 6 of earths total surface area and 20 of its land area with 12 billion people as of 2016 it accounts for about 16 of the worlds human population the continent is surrounded by the mediterranean sea to the north the isthmus of suez and the red sea to the northeast the indian ocean to the southeast and the atlantic ocean to the west the continent includes madagascar and various archipelagos it contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states countries nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition the majority of the continent and its countries are in the northern hemisphere with a substantial portion and number of countries in the southern hemisphere africas average population is the youngest amongst all the continents the median age in 2012 was 197 when the worldwide median age was 304 algeria is africas largest country by area and nigeria is its largest by population africa particularly central eastern africa is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the hominidae clade great apes as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago including sahelanthropus tchadensis australopithecus africanus a afarensis homo erectus h habilis and h ergasterthe earliest homo sapiens modern human found in ethiopia date to circa 200000 years ago africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities cultures and languages in the late 19th century european countries colonised almost all of africa most present states in africa originated from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century african nations cooperate through the establishment of the african union which is headquartered in addis ababa etymology afri was a latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern africa to the west of the nile river and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean ancient libya this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe an ancestor of modern berbers see terence for discussion the name had usually been connected with the phoenician word afar meaning dust but a 1981 hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the berber word ifri plural ifran meaning cave in reference to cave dwellers the same word may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania a berber tribe originally from yafran also known as ifrane in northwestern libya under roman rule carthage became the capital of the province it then named africa proconsularis following its defeat of the carthaginians in the third punic war in 146 bc which also included the coastal part of modern libya the latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land eg in celtica from celtae as used by julius caesar the later muslim region of ifriqiya following its conquest of the byzantine eastern roman empires exarchatus africae also preserved a form of the name according to the romans africa lay to the west of egypt while asia was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy 85165 ad indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of africa expanded with their knowledge other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name africa the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus ant 115 asserted that it was named for epher grandson of abraham according to gen 254 whose descendants he claimed had invaded libya isidore of seville in his 7th-century etymologiae xiv52 suggests africa comes from the latin aprica meaning sunny massey in 1881 stated that africa is derived from the egyptian af-rui-ka meaning to turn toward the opening of the ka the ka is the energetic double of every person and the opening of the ka refers to a womb or birthplace africa would be for the egyptians the birthplace michle fruyt in 1976 proposed linking the latin word with africus south wind which would be of umbrian origin and mean originally rainy wind robert r stieglitz of rutgers university in 1984 proposed the name africa derived from the latin aphir-ic-a is cognate to hebrew ophir ibn khallikan and some other historians claim that the name of africa came from a himyarite king called afrikin ibn kais ibn saifi also called afrikus son of abrahah who subdued ifriqiya history prehistory africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human species originating from the continent during the mid-20th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago bpbefore present fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man such as australopithecus afarensis radiometrically dated to approximately 3930million years bp paranthropus boisei c 2314million years bp and homo ergaster c 19million600000 years bp have been discovered after the evolution of homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150000 to 100000 years bp in africa the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50000 years bp exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea the strait of gibraltar in morocco or the isthmus of suez in egypt other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa southeast africa north africa and the sahara the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions at the end of the ice ages estimated to have been around 10500 bc the sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili najjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia however the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile around 3500 bc due to a tilt in the earths orbit the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements a major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa since this time dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and increasingly during the last 200 years in ethiopia the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures it is speculated that by 6000 bc cattle were domesticated in north africa in the sahara-nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia around 4000 bc the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification this in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west africa by the first millennium bc ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan africa and by 500 bc metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa although other regions didnt begin ironworking until the early centuries ad copper objects from egypt north africa nubia and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc have been excavated in west africa suggesting that trans-saharan trade networks had been established by this date early civilizations at about 3300 bc the historical record opens in northern africa with the rise of literacy in the pharaonic civilization of ancient egypt one of the worlds earliest and longest-lasting civilizations the egyptian state continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 bc egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day libya and nubia and according to martin bernal as far north as crete an independent centre of civilization with trading links to phoenicia was established by phoenicians from tyre on the north-west african coast at carthage european exploration of africa began with ancient greeks and romans in 332 bc alexander the great was welcomed as a liberator in persian-occupied egypt he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death following the conquest of north africas mediterranean coastline by the roman empire the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus born in leptis magna in present-day libyahis mother was italian roman and his father was punic christianity spread across these areas at an early date from judaea via egypt and beyond the borders of the roman world into nubia by ad 340 at the latest it had become the state religion of the aksumite empire syro-greek missionaries who arrived by way of the red sea were responsible for this theological development in the early 7th century the newly formed arabian islamic caliphate expanded into egypt and then into north africa in a short while the local berber elite had been integrated into muslim arab tribes when the umayyad capital damascus fell in the 8th century the islamic centre of the mediterranean shifted from syria to qayrawan in north africa islamic north africa had become diverse and a hub for mystics scholars jurists and philosophers during the above-mentioned period islam spread to sub-saharan africa mainly through trade routes and migration ninth to eighteenth centuries pre-colonial africa possessed perhaps as many as 10000 different states and polities characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule these included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the san people of southern africa larger more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the bantu-speaking peoples of central southern and eastern africa heavily structured clan groups in the horn of africa the large sahelian kingdoms and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the akan edo yoruba and igbo people in west africa and the swahili coastal trading towns of southeast africa by the ninth century ad a string of dynastic states including the earliest hausa states stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central sudan the most powerful of these states were ghana gao and the kanem-bornu empire ghana declined in the eleventh century but was succeeded by the mali empire which consolidated much of western sudan in the thirteenth century kanem accepted islam in the eleventh century in the forested regions of the west african coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes found at the town of igbo-ukwu the bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century the kingdom of ife historically the first of these yoruba city-states or kingdoms established government under a priestly oba king or ruler in the yoruba language called the ooni of ife ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in west africa and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture the ife model of government was adapted at the oyo empire where its obas or kings called the alaafins of oyo once controlled a large number of other yoruba and non-yoruba city-states and kingdoms the fon kingdom of dahomey was one of the non-yoruba domains under oyo control the almoravids were a berber dynasty from the sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the eleventh century the banu hilal and banu maqil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers where the locals were arabized and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of islam following the breakup of mali a local leader named sonni ali 14641492 founded the songhai empire in the region of middle niger and the western sudan and took control of the trans-saharan trade sonni ali seized timbuktu in 1468 and jenne in 1473 building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of muslim merchants his successor askia mohammad i 14931528 made islam the official religion built mosques and brought to gao muslim scholars including al-maghili d1504 the founder of an important tradition of sudanic african muslim scholarship by the eleventh century some hausa states such as kano jigawa katsina and gobir had developed into walled towns engaging in trade servicing caravans and the manufacture of goods until the fifteenth century these small states were on the periphery of the major sudanic empires of the era paying tribute to songhai to the west and kanem-borno to the east mansa musa ruled the mali empire in the 14th century height of slave trade slavery had long been practiced in africa between the 7th and 20th centuries the arab slave trade also known as slavery in the east took 18 million slaves from africa via trans-saharan and indian ocean routes between the 15th and the 19th centuries the atlantic slave trade took an estimated 712 million slaves to the new world in addition more than 1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries in west africa the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities the gradual decline of slave-trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america and the british royal navys increasing presence off the west african coast obliged african states to adopt new economies between 1808 and 1860 the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1600 slave ships and freed 150000 africans who were aboard action was also taken against african leaders who refused to agree to british treaties to outlaw the trade for example against the usurping king of lagos deposed in 1851 anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 african rulers the largest powers of west africa the asante confederacy the kingdom of dahomey and the oyo empire adopted different ways of adapting to the shift asante and dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil cocoa timber and gold forming the bedrock of west africas modern export trade the oyo empire unable to adapt collapsed into civil wars colonialism and the scramble for africa in the late 19th century the european imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent creating many colonial territories and leaving only two fully independent states ethiopia known to europeans as abyssinia and liberia egypt and sudan were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire however after the british occupation of 1882 egypt was effectively under british administration until 1922 berlin conference the berlin conference held in 188485 was an important event in the political future of african ethnic groups it was convened by king leopold ii of belgium and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories the berlin conference sought to end the european powers scramble for africa by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence they set up the political divisions of the continent by spheres of interest that exist in africa today independence struggles imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence independence movements in africa gained momentum following world war ii which left the major european powers weakened in 1951 libya a former italian colony gained independence in 1956 tunisia and morocco won their independence from france ghana followed suit the next year march 1957 becoming the first of the sub-saharan colonies to be granted independence most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade portugals overseas presence in sub-saharan africa most notably in angola cape verde mozambique guinea-bissau and so tom and prncipe lasted from the 16th century to 1975 after the estado novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in lisbon rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the united kingdom in 1965 under the white minority government of ian smith but was not internationally recognized as an independent state as zimbabwe until 1980 when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war although south africa was one of the first african countries to gain independence the state remained under the control of the countrys white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994 post-colonial africa today africa contains 54 sovereign countries most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism since colonialism african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule however few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis and many have instead cycled through a series of coups producing military dictatorships great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups and graft under these leaders for political gain many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts some of which had been exacerbated or even created by colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations border and territorial disputes were also common with the european-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union as well as the policies of the international monetary fund also played a role in instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states france or both the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements in rhodesia soviet and chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the zimbabwe patriotic front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the countrys white government there was a major famine in ethiopia when hundreds of thousands of people starved some claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 55 million people since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800000 people were murdered aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issue in the 21st century however the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined for instance the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years this coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations mainly from china which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline several african economies are among the worlds fastest growing as of 2016 a significant part of this growth which is sometimes referred to as africa rising can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone migration from african nations has increased dramatically in the last decade geology and geography africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the earth separated from europe by the mediterranean sea it is joined to asia at its northeast extremity by the isthmus of suez transected by the suez canal 163km 101mi wide geopolitically egypts sinai peninsula east of the suez canal is often considered part of africa as well the coastline is 26000km 16000mi long and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that europe which covers only 10400000km 4000000sqmi about a third of the surface of africa has a coastline of 32000km 20000mi from the most northerly point ras ben sakka in tunisia 3721 n to the most southerly point cape agulhas in south africa 345115 s is a distance of approximately 8000km 5000mi cape verde 173322 w the westernmost point is a distance of approximately 7400km 4600mi to ras hafun 512752 e the most easterly projection that neighbours cape guardafui the tip of the horn of africa africas largest country is algeria and its smallest country is seychelles an archipelago off the east coast the smallest nation on the continental mainland is the gambia african plate the african plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian it includes much of the continent of africa as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges between 60million years ago and 10million years ago the somali plate began rifting from the african plate along the east african rift since the continent of africa consists of crust from both the african and the somali plates some literature refers to the african plate as the nubian plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole geologically africa includes the arabian peninsula the zagros mountains of iran and the anatolian plateau of turkey mark where the african plate collided with eurasia the afrotropic ecozone and the saharo-arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically and the afro-asiatic language family unites the north linguistically climate the climate of africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks its northern half is primarily desert or arid while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle rainforest regions in between there is a convergence where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60 of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts the record for the highest-ever recorded temperature in libya in 1922 58c 136f was discredited in 2013 fauna africa boasts perhaps the worlds largest combination of density and range of freedom of wild animal populations and diversity with wild populations of large carnivores such as lions hyenas and cheetahs and herbivores such as buffalo elephants camels and giraffes ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains it is also home to a variety of jungle animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians in addition africa has the largest number of megafauna species as it was least affected by the extinction of the pleistocene megafauna ecology and biodiversity africa has over 3000 protected areas with 198 marine protected areas 50 biosphere reserves and 80 wetlands reserves significant habitat destruction increases in human population and poaching are reducing africas biological diversity and arable land human encroachment civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in africa this has been exacerbated by administrative problems inadequate personnel and funding problems deforestation is affecting africa at twice the world rate according to the united nations environment programme unep according to the university of pennsylvania african studies center 31 of africas pasture lands and 19 of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded and africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world some sources claim that approximately 90 of the original virgin forests in west africa have been destroyed over 90 of madagascars original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago about 65 of africas agricultural land suffers from soil degradation politics there are clear signs of increased networking among african organizations and states for example in the civil war in the democratic republic of the congo former zaire rather than rich non-african countries intervening neighbouring african countries became involved see also second congo war since the conflict began in 1998 the estimated death toll has reached 5 million the african union the african union au is a 55-member federation consisting of all of africas states the union was formed with addis ababa ethiopia as its headquarters on 26 june 2001 the union was officially established on 9 july 2002 as a successor to the organisation of african unity oau in july 2004 the african unions pan-african parliament pap was relocated to midrand in south africa but the african commission on human and peoples rights remained in addis ababa there is a policy in effect to decentralize the african federations institutions so that they are shared by all the states the african union not to be confused with the au commission is formed by the constitutive act of the african union which aims to transform the african economic community a federated commonwealth into a state under established international conventions the african union has a parliamentary government known as the african union government consisting of legislative judicial and executive organs it is led by the african union president and head of state who is also the president of the pan-african parliament a person becomes au president by being elected to the pap and subsequently gaining majority support in the pap the powers and authority of the president of the african parliament derive from the constitutive act and the protocol of the pan-african parliament as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by african treaties and by international treaties including those subordinating the secretary general of the oau secretariat au commission to the pap the government of the au consists of all-union federal regional state and municipal authorities as well as hundreds of institutions that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution political associations such as the african union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continents many countries extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of africa often under the oversight of the state most of such violations occur for political reasons often as a side effect of civil war countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the democratic republic of the congo sierra leone liberia sudan zimbabwe and cte divoire economy although it has abundant natural resources africa remains the worlds poorest and most under-equipped continent the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations failed central planning high levels of illiteracy lack of access to foreign capital and frequent tribal and military conflict ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide its total nominal gdp remains behind that of the united states china japan germany the united kingdom india and france according to the united nations human development report in 2003 the bottom 24 ranked nations 151st to 175th were all african poverty illiteracy malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation as well as poor health affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent in august 2008 the world bank announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of 125 per day versus the previous measure of 100 81 of the sub-saharan africa population was living on less than 250 ppp per day in 2005 compared with 86 for india sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty 125 per day some 50 of the population living in poverty in 1981 200 million people a figure that rose to 58 in 1996 before dropping to 50 in 2005 380 million people the average poor person in sub-saharan africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973 indicating increasing poverty in some areas some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors africa is now at risk of being in debt once again particularly in sub-saharan african countries the last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme hipc the hipc resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in africa about ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-saharan africa was resolved zambia fell back into dept a small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011 but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite from 1995 to 2005 africas rate of economic growth increased averaging 5 in 2005 some countries experienced still higher growth rates notably angola sudan and equatorial guinea all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity in a recently published analysis based on world values survey data the austrian political scientist arno tausch maintained that several african countries most notably ghana perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy tauschs global value comparison based on the world values survey derived the following factor analytical scales 1 the non-violent and law-abiding society 2 democracy movement 3 climate of personal non-violence 4 trust in institutions 5 happiness good health 6 no redistributive religious fundamentalism 7 accepting the market 8 feminism 9 involvement in politics 10 optimism and engagement 11 no welfare mentality acceptancy of the calvinist work ethics the spread in the performance of african countries with complete data tausch concluded is really amazing while one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in ghana the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for egypt and algeria and especially for africas leading economy south africa high human inequality as measured by the undps human development reports index of human inequality further impairs the development of human security tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism corresponding to economic and human rights data emerging from africa is reflected in the development of a civil society the continent is believed to hold 90 of the worlds cobalt 90 of its platinum 50 of its gold 98 of its chromium 70 of its tantalite 64 of its manganese and one-third of its uranium the democratic republic of the congo drc has 70 of the worlds coltan a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones the drc also has more than 30 of the worlds diamond reserves guinea is the worlds largest exporter of bauxite as the growth in africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels in fact the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity in recent years the peoples republic of china has built increasingly stronger ties with african nations and is africas largest trading partner in 2007 chinese companies invested a total of us1 billion in africa a harvard university study led by professor calestous juma showed that africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency african agriculture is at the crossroads we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured africas export of raw materials and importation of food africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity during us president barack obamas visit to africa in july 2013 he announced a us7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with african heads of state he also announced a new programme named trade africa designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between africa and the us demographics africas population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years and consequently it is relatively young in some african states more than half the population is under 25 years of age the total number of people in africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990 as of 2016 the population of africa is estimated at 12 billion africas total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent african population surpassed europe in the 1990s while the americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000 africas rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population at roughly the same time india and chinas 14 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022 this increase in number of babies born in africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37 in the year 2050 an increase of 21 since 1990 alone speakers of bantu languages part of the nigercongo family are the majority in southern central and southeast africa the bantu-speaking peoples from the sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-saharan africa but there are also several nilotic groups in south sudan and east africa the mixed swahili people on the swahili coast and a few remaining indigenous khoisan san or bushmen and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa respectively bantu-speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea and are found in parts of southern cameroon in the kalahari desert of southern africa the distinct people known as the bushmen also san closely related to but distinct from hottentots have long been present the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa pygmies are the pre-bantu indigenous peoples of central africa the peoples of west africa primarily speak nigercongo languages belonging mostly to its non-bantu branches though some nilo-saharan and afro-asiatic speaking groups are also found the nigercongo-speaking yoruba igbo fulani akan and wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential in the central sahara mandinka or mande groups are most significant chadic-speaking groups including the hausa are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the sahara and nilo-saharan communities such as the songhai kanuri and zarma are found in the eastern parts of west africa bordering central africa the peoples of north africa consist of three main indigenous groups berbers in the northwest egyptians in the northeast and nilo-saharan-speaking peoples in the east the arabs who arrived in the 7th century ad introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians who founded carthage and hyksos the indo-iranian alans the indo- european greeks romans and vandals settled in north africa as well significant berber communities remain within morocco and algeria in the 21st century while to a lesser extent berber speakers are also present in some regions of tunisia and libya the berber-speaking tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa in mauritania there is a small but near-extinct berber community in the north and nigercongo-speaking peoples in the south though in both regions arabic and arab culture predominates in sudan although arabic and arab culture predominate it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke nilo-saharan such as the nubians fur masalit and zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the arabian peninsula small communities of afro-asiatic-speaking beja nomads can also be found in egypt and sudan in the horn of africa some ethiopian and eritrean groups like the amhara and tigrayans collectively known as habesha speak languages from the semitic branch of the afro-asiatic language family while the oromo and somali speak languages from the cushitic branch of afro-asiatic prior to the decolonization movements of the post-world war ii era europeans were represented in every part of africa decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers especially from algeria and morocco 16 million pieds-noirs in north africa kenya congo rhodesia mozambique and angola between 1975 and 1977 over a million colonials returned to portugal alone nevertheless white africans remain an important minority in many african states particularly zimbabwe namibia runion and the republic of south africa the country with the largest white african population is south africa dutch and british diasporas represent the largest communities of european ancestry on the continent today european colonization also brought sizable groups of asians particularly from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and southeast african countries the large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in 1972 though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds people with origins in two or more races and continents during the 20th century small but economically important communities of lebanese and chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa respectively languages by most estimates well over a thousand languages unesco has estimated around two thousand are spoken in africa most are of african origin though some are of european or asian origin africa is the most multilingual continent in the world and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple african languages but one or more european ones as well there are four major language families indigenous to africa the afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the horn of africa north africa the sahel and southwest asia the nilo-saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people nilo-saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in chad ethiopia kenya nigeria sudan south sudan uganda and northern tanzania the niger-congo language family covers much of sub-saharan africa in terms of number of languages it is the largest language family in africa and perhaps the largest in the world the khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in southern africa by approximately 400000 people many of the khoisan languages are endangered the khoi and san peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of africa following the end of colonialism nearly all african countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages such as swahili yoruba igbo and hausa in numerous countries english and french see african french are used for communication in the public sphere such as government commerce education and the media arabic portuguese afrikaans and spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of africa and that are used by millions of africans today both in the public and private spheres italian is spoken by some in former italian colonies in africa german is spoken in namibia as it was a former german protectorate culture some aspects of traditional african cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes for example african customs were discouraged and african languages were prohibited in mission schools leopold ii of belgium attempted to civilize africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m cole the precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art fraser and cole assert that in igboland some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions author chika okeke-agulu states that the racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art in soweto the west rand administrative board established a cultural section to collect read and review scripts before performances could occur editors f abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between africa and europe on the other hand mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music dance spirituality and other performative cultures to reasset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures under such movements as the african renaissance led by thabo mbeki afrocentrism led by a group of scholars including molefi asante as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of vodou and other forms of spirituality visual art and architecture african art and architecture reflect the diversity of african cultures the regions oldest known beads were made from nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72000 years ago the great pyramid of giza in egypt was the worlds tallest structure for 4000 years until the completion of lincoln cathedral around the year 1300 the stone ruins of great zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture as are the monolithic churches at lalibela ethiopia such as the church of saint george music and dance egypt has long been a cultural focus of the arab world while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-saharan africa in particular west africa was transmitted through the atlantic slave trade to modern samba blues jazz reggae hip hop and rock the 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of afrobeat and highlife music modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous dominated by the music of the democratic republic of congo indigenous musical and dance traditions of africa are maintained by oral traditions and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of north africa and southern africa arab influences are visible in north african music and dance and in southern africa western influences are apparent due to colonization sports fifty-four african countries have football soccer teams in the confederation of african football egypt has won the african cup seven times and a
