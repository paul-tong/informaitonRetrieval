luminance is a photometric measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction it describes the amount of light that passes through is emitted or reflected from a particular area and falls within a given solid angle the si unit for luminance is candela per square metre cdm a non-si term for the same unit is the nit the cgs unit of luminance is the stilb which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10kcdm explanation luminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat diffuse surfaces the luminance indicates how much luminous power will be detected by an eye looking at the surface from a particular angle of view luminance is thus an indicator of how bright the surface will appear in this case the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the eyes pupil luminance is used in the video industry to characterize the brightness of displays a typical computer display emits between 50 and 7002300000000000000300cdm the sun has a luminance of about 70091600000000000001610cdm at noon luminance is invariant in geometric optics this means that for an ideal optical system the luminance at the output is the same as the input luminance for real passive optical systems the output luminance is at most equal to the input as an example if one uses a lens to form an image that is smaller than the source object the luminous power is concentrated into a smaller area meaning that the illuminance is higher at the image the light at the image plane however fills a larger solid angle so the luminance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens the image can never be brighter than the source definition the luminance of a specified point of a light source in a specified direction is defined by the derivative where lv is the luminance cdm dv is the luminous flux lm leaving the area d in any direction contained inside the solid angle d d is an infinitesimal area m of the source containing the specified point d is an infinitesimal solid angle sr containing the specified direction is the angle between the normal n to the surface d and the specified direction if light travels through a lossless medium the luminance does not change along a given light ray as the ray crosses an arbitrary surface s the luminance is given by where ds is the infinitesimal area of s seen from the source inside the solid angle d ds is the infinitesimal solid angle subtended by d as seen from ds s is the angle between the normal ns to ds and the direction of the light more generally the luminance along a light ray can be defined as where dg is the etendue of an infinitesimally narrow beam containing the specified ray dv is the luminous flux carried by this beam n is the index of refraction of the medium relation to illuminance the luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the illuminance it receives where the integral covers all the directions of emission and mv is the surfaces luminous exitance ev is the received illuminance and r is the reflectance in the case of a perfectly diffuse reflector also called a lambertian reflector the luminance is isotropic per lamberts cosine law then the relationship is simply units a variety of units have been used for luminance besides the candela per square metre one candela per square metre is equal to 10 stilbs the cgs unit of luminance apostilbs 10 lamberts 0292 foot-lamberts health effects retinal damage can occur when the eye is exposed to high luminance damage can occur due to local heating of the retina photochemical effects can also cause damage especially at short wavelengths luminance meter a luminance meter is a device used in photometry that can measure the luminance in a particular direction and with a particular solid angle the simplest devices measure the luminance in a single direction while imaging luminance meters measure luminance in a way similar to the way a digital camera records color images see also orders of magnitude luminance diffuse reflection etendue exposure value lambertian reflectance lightness property of a color luma the representation of luminance in a video monitor lumen unit radiance radiometric quantity analogous to luminance brightness the subjective impression of luminance glare a kodak guide to estimating luminance and illuminance using a cameras exposure meter also available in pdf form autodesk design academy measuring light levels
