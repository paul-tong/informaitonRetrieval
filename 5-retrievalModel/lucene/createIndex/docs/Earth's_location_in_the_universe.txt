knowledge of the location of earth has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations and has expanded radically in the last century initially earth was believed to be the center of the universe which consisted only of those planets visible with the naked eye and an outlying sphere of fixed stars after the acceptance of the heliocentric model in the 17th century observations by william herschel and others showed that the sun lay within a vast disc-shaped galaxy of stars by the 20th century observations of spiral nebulae revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an expanding universe grouped into clusters and superclusters by the end of the 20th century the overall structure of the visible universe was becoming clearer with superclusters forming into a vast web of filaments and voids superclusters filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the universe that we can observe at still larger scales over 1000 megaparsecs the universe becomes homogeneous meaning that all its parts have on average the same density composition and structure since there is believed to be no center or edge of the universe there is no particular reference point with which to plot the overall location of the earth in the universe because the observable universe is defined as that region of the universe visible to terrestrial observers earth is by definition the center of earths observable universe reference can be made to the earths position with respect to specific structures which exist at various scales it is still undetermined whether the universe is infinite there have been numerous hypotheses that our universe may be only one such example within a higher multiverse however no direct evidence of any sort of multiverse has ever been observed and some have argued that the hypothesis is not falsifiable see also cosmic view cosmic zoom galaxy song orders of magnitude length pale blue dot powers of ten film history of the center of the universe notes
