cosmology from the greek kosmos world and - -logia study of is a branch of astronomy concerned with the studies of the origin and evolution of the universe from the big bang to today and on into the future it is the scientific study of the origin evolution and eventual fate of the universe physical cosmology is the scientific study of the universes origin its large-scale structures and dynamics and its ultimate fate as well as the laws of science that govern these areas the term cosmology was first used in english in 1656 in thomas blounts glossographia and in 1731 taken up in latin by german philosopher christian wolff in cosmologia generalis religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology physical cosmology is studied by scientists such as astronomers and physicists as well as philosophers such as metaphysicians philosophers of physics and philosophers of space and time because of this shared scope with philosophy theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects modern physical cosmology is dominated by the big bang theory which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics more specifically a standard parameterization of the big bang with dark matter and dark energy known as the lambda-cdm model theoretical astrophysicist david n spergel has described cosmology as a historical science because when we look out in space we look back in time due to the finite nature of the speed of light disciplines view talk edit physics and astrophysics have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe the universe is generally understood to have begun with the big bang followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13799 0021 billion years ago cosmogony studies the origin of the universe and cosmography maps the features of the universe in diderots encyclopdie cosmology is broken down into uranology the science of the heavens aerology the science of the air geology the science of the continents and hydrology the science of waters metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities this is exemplified by marcus aureliuss observation that a mans place in that relationship he who does not know what the world is does not know where he is and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists does not know who he is nor what the world is physical cosmology physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the universe it also includes the study of the nature of the universe on a large scale in its earliest form it was what is now known as celestial mechanics the study of the heavens greek philosophers aristarchus of samos aristotle and ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories the geocentric ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when nicolaus copernicus and subsequently johannes kepler and galileo galilei proposed a heliocentric system this is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology isaac newtons principia mathematica published in 1687 was the first description of the law of universal gravitation it provided a physical mechanism for keplers laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems caused by gravitational interaction between the planets to be resolved a fundamental difference between newtons cosmology and those preceding it was the copernican principlethat the bodies on earth obey the same physical laws as all the celestial bodies this was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with albert einsteins publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper cosmological considerations of the general theory of relativity although this paper was not widely available outside of germany until the end of world wari general relativity prompted cosmogonists such as willem de sitter karl schwarzschild and arthur eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects physicists began changing the assumption that the universe was static and unchanging in 1922 alexander friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter around the same time 1917 to 1922 the great debate took place with early cosmologists such as heber curtis and ernst pik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own in parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax mount wilson astronomer harlow shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the milky way star system only while heber d curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes this difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the great debate on 26 april 1920 at the meeting of the us national academy of sciences in washington dc the debate was resolved when edwin hubble detected cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy in 1923 and 1924 their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the milky way subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant introduced by einstein in his 1917 paper may result in an expanding universe depending on its value thus the big bang model was proposed by the belgian priest georges lematre in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by edwin hubbles discovery of the red shift in 1929 and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by arno penzias and robert woodrow wilson in 1964 these findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies since around 1990 several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation these advances include observations of the microwave background from the cobe wmap and planck satellites large new galaxy redshift surveys including 2dfgrs and sdss and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing these observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory a modified big bang theory and the specific version known as the lambda-cdm model this has led many to refer to modern times as the golden age of cosmology on 17 march 2014 astronomers at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics announced the detection of gravitational waves providing strong evidence for inflation and the big bang however on 19 june 2014 lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported on 1 december 2014 at the planck 2014 meeting in ferrara italy astronomers reported that the universe is 138 billion years old and is composed of 49 atomic matter 266 dark matter and 685 dark energy religious or mythological cosmology religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology philosophical cosmology cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space time and all phenomena historically it has had quite a broad scope and in many cases was founded in religion in modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the universe which are beyond the scope of science it is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like dialectics modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as what is the origin of the universe what is its first cause is its existence necessary see monism pantheism emanationism and creationism what are the ultimate material components of the universe see mechanism dynamism hylomorphism atomism what is the ultimate reason for the existence of the universe does the cosmos have a purpose see teleology does the existence of consciousness have a purpose how do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths see epistemology historical cosmologies table notes the term static simply means not expanding and not
