the strait of magellan spanish estrecho de magallanes also called the straits of magellan is a navigable sea route in southern chile separating mainland south america to the north and tierra del fuego to the south the strait is the most important natural passage between the atlantic and pacific oceans the route is considered difficult to navigate due to frequent narrows and unpredictable winds and currents maritime piloting is now compulsory the strait is shorter and more sheltered than the drake passage the often stormy open sea route around cape horn along with the narrow and sometimes treacherous beagle channel and the seasonal and historically treacherous north west passage these were the only sea routes between the atlantic and pacific until the construction of the panama canal history indigenous peoples the strait of magellan has been inhabited by indigenous americans for thousands of years on the western part of its northern coast lived the alacalufe also known as the kawsqar to the east of the kawsqar lived the tehuelche whose territory extended to the north in patagonia south of the tehuelche across the strait of magellan lived the selknam who inhabited the majority of the eastern portion of tierra del fuego to the west of the selknam were the yaghan who inhabited the southernmost part of tierra del fuego all tribes in the strait of magellan area were nomadic hunter-gatherers the only non-maritime culture in the area were the tehuelche who fished and gathered shellfish along the coast during the winter and moved into the southern andes in the summer to hunt in the other three maritime-based tribes each family had a canoe around 7 to 9 feet long that held the entire family and a dog the canoe often contained a fire the family would use for warmth their sustenance came almost entirely from the sea the men typically hunted seals and fished while the women dove into the frigid waters to gather shellfish they wore little to no clothing and made extensive use of fires to keep warm in the bitterly-cold climate the tribes of the region faced little european interference until the late 19th century then european diseases wiped out large portions of the indigenous population and extermination campaigns sponsored by the governments of chile and argentina like the selknam genocide eliminated the rest some were taken in by missionaries but today almost no full-blooded descendants of these peoples remain and almost all of their culture is lost only two languages formerly spoken along the strait of magellan are extant and both are spoken by less than ten people although today there are hundreds of people who self-identify as descendants of indigenous peoples from the strait of magellan discovery by europeans accounts before magellan it was reported by antnio galvo in 1563 that the position of the strait of magellan was previously mentioned in old charts as dragons tail draco cola he pedro brought a map which had all the circuit of the world described the strait of magellan was called the dragons tail and there were also the cape of good hope and the coast of africa francisco de sousa tavares told me that in the year 1528 the infant d fernando showed him a map which had been found in the cartorio of alcobaa which had been made more than 120 years before the which contained all the navigation of india with the cape of good hope this however would suggest that the strait was mentioned in maps before the americas were discovered and consequently the claim has to be considered dubious magellan ferdinand magellan portuguese ferno de magalhes a portuguese explorer and navigator in the service of charles i of spain became the first european to navigate the strait in 1520 during his global circumnavigation voyage on march 22 1518 the expedition was organized in valladolid naming magellan captain general of the fleet and governor of all the lands discovered and establishing the privileges of magellan and his business associate rui faleiro the fleet would become known as the armada de las molucas or fleet of the moluccas the expeditionary fleet of five ships set sail from sanlcar de barrameda on september 20 1519 the five ships included la trinidad 110 tons crew 55 under the command of magellan la san antonio 120 tons crew60 under the command of juan de cartagena la concepcin 90 tons crew45 under the command of gaspar de quezada juan sebastin elcano served as boatswain la victoria 85 tons crew 42 under the command of luis de mendoza and la santiago 75 tons crew32 under command of juan rodrguez serrano joo rodrigues serro before the passage of the strait and after the mutiny in puerto san julin lvaro de mesquita became captain of the san antonio and duarte barbosa of victoria later serro became captain of concepcion his santiago sent on a mission to find the passage was caught in a storm and wrecked san antonio charged to explore magdalen sound failed to return to the fleet instead sailing back to spain under estvo gomes who imprisoned the captain mesquita magellans ships entered the strait on november 1 1520 all saints day and it was initially called estrecho de todos los santos strait of all saints magellans chronicler antonio pigafetta called it the patagonian strait and others victoria strait commemorating the first ship entering it within seven years it was being called estrecho de magallanes in honor of magellan the spanish empire and the captaincy general of chile used it as the southern boundary of their territory other explorers the first spanish colony was established in 1584 by pedro sarmiento de gamboa who founded nombre de jess and rey don felipe on the northern shore of the strait these towns suffered severe food shortages and when the english navigator sir thomas cavendish landed at the site of rey don felipe in 1587 he found only ruins of the settlement he renamed the place port famine other early explorers included francis drake 1578 in february 1696 the first french expedition under the command of m de gennes reached the strait of magellan the expedition is described by the young french explorer engineer and hydrographer franois froger in his a relation of a voyage 1699 the first map of the pacific ocean descriptio maris pacifici from 1589 depicts the strait as the only route between the atlantic and pacific oceans the much wider drake passage was discovered in 1616 the strait was first carefully explored and thoroughly charted by phillip parker king who commanded the british survey vessel hms adventure and in consort with hms beagle spent five years surveying the complex coasts around the strait 18261830 a report on the survey was presented at two meetings of the geographical society of london in 1831 incorporation into chile chile took possession of the strait of magellan on may 23 1843 president bulnes of chile ordered this expedition after consulting the chilean libertador bernardo ohiggins 17781842 who feared an occupation by great britain or france the first chilean settlement was fuerte bulnes situated in a forested zone on the north side of the strait fuerte bulnes was later abandoned and in 1848 the city of punta arenas was founded farther north where the magellanic forests meets the patagonian plains in tierra del fuego across the strait from punta arenas the village of porvenir emerged during the tierra del fuego gold rush in the late 19th century argentina effectively recognized chilean sovereignty over the strait of magellan in the boundary treaty of 1881 between chile and argentina argentina had previously claimed all of the strait or at least the eastern third of it in 1840 the pacific steam navigation company was the first to use steamships for commercial traffic in the strait until the panama canal opened in 1914 the strait of magellan was the main route for steamships traveling from the atlantic ocean to the pacific it was often considered the only safe way to move between the atlantic and pacific oceans as the drake passage separating cape horn the southern tip of south america from antarctica is notorious for turbulent and unpredictable weather and is frequented by icebergs and sea ice ships in the strait protected by tierra del fuego to the south and the coast of continental south america to the north crossed with relative ease and punta arenas became a primary refueling port providing coal for steam ships in transit sailing ships however partly because of variable winds and currents in the strait generally preferred the drake passage as they had more room to maneuver there features the strait is approximately 570 kilometres 310nmi 350mi long and about 2 kilometres 11nmi 12mi wide at its narrowest point carlos iii island west of cape froward the northwestern portion of the strait is connected with other sheltered waterways via the smyth channel this area is similar to the inside passage of alaska south of cape froward the principal shipping route follows the magdalena channel the eastern opening is a wide bay on the border of chile and argentina between punta dngeness on the mainland and cabo del espritu santo cape of the holy spirit on tierra del fuego the border as defined in the treaty of peace and friendship of 1984 between chile and argentina immediately west are primera angostura and segunda angostura narrows formed by two terminal moraines of different ages the primera angostura is the closest approach of isla grande de tierra del fuego to the mainland of south america farther west lies magdalena island part of los pinginos natural monument the straits southern boundary in the east follows first the shoreline of the isla grande de tierra del fuego then the northern end of the canal whiteside and the shoreline of dawson island the western part of the strait leads northwest from the northern end of the magdalena channel to the straits pacific entrance this portion of the strait is flanked on the south by capitn aracena island clarence island santa ins island desolacin island cabo pilar and other smaller islands and on the north by brunswick peninsula riesco island muoz gamero peninsula manuel rodriguez island and other minor islands of the queen adelaide archipelago two narrow channels connect the strait with seno otway and seno skyring a broader channel smyth channel leads north from the strait between muoz gamero peninsula and manuel rodriguez island francisco coloane coastal and marine protected area a sanctuary for humpback whales is located in this area this part of the strait lies on the elongated magallanes-fagnano fault which marks a plate boundary between the south american plate and the scotia plate this fault continues southward under almirantazgo fjord and then below fagnano lake possibly new tourism industries could be established in the eastern part of the strait for watching southern right whales as the number of observations in the area has increased in recent years toponym of the zone the place names of the zone come from a variety of origins many from spanish and english and from at least one native language that is adaptations of the ona language to the spanish language phonology and spelling like timaukel hamlet at the east side of tierra del fuego carukinka the end of the almirantazgo fjord anika a channel located at 54 7 s and 70 30 w and arska the north side of the dawson island magellan named initially the strait todos los santos as he began the voyage through the west on 1 november 1520 charles v holy roman emperor renamed it as estrecho de magallanes magellan named the island on the south side as tierra del fuego which the yaghan people called onaisn in the yaghan language magellan also gave the name patagones big feet to the mainland indians their land was subsequently known as patagonia baha cordes is named after the dutch pirate baltazar de cordes lighthouses in the strait the national geospatial-intelligence agency lists 41 lighthouses in the waterway some of them are more than a century old and some are declared monumento nacional among the most impressive lighthouses are the county of peebles hulk the worlds first four-masted iron-hulled full-rig ship used now as a breakwater for the harbour at punta arenas the san isidro lighthouse restored in 2004 and which is now a museum and lodge and the evangelistas lighthouse located at the western mouth of the strait and built by george slight who wrote on his arrival in 1934 i never imagined seeing something so wild and desolate as those emerging dark rocks in the middle of the raging waves to see these stormy craggy rocks was frightening with a dim light on the horizon we could see large waves crashing heavily in the western part of the islands a vision that hardly anyone can imagine tidal characteristics of the strait of magellan on the atlantic side the strait is characterized by semidiurnal macrotides with mean and spring tide ranges of 71 and 90 m respectively on the pacific side tides are mixed mainly semidiurnal with mean and spring tide ranges of 11 and 12 m respectively there is enormous tidal
