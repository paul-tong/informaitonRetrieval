the apollo telescope mount or atm was a solar observatory attached to skylab the first american space station the atm was manually operated by the astronauts aboard skylab from 197374 yielding data principally as exposed photographic film that was returned to earth with the crew the film magazines had to be changed out by the crew during spacewalks the atm was designed and construction was managed at nasas marshall space flight center it included eight major observational instruments along with several lesser experiments the atm made observations at a variety of wavelengths including x-rays ultraviolet and visible light as of 2006 the original exposures were on file and accessible to interested parties at the naval research laboratory in washington dc design the atm was actively cooled to maintain the temperature of the instruments within a certain range pointing was done with the help of the skylab computer which could be commanded from the space station by astronauts or by communication link from earth history the atm was one of the projects that came out of the late 1960s apollo applications program which studied a wide variety of ways to use the infrastructure developed for the apollo program in the 1970s among these concepts were various extended-stay lunar missions a permanent lunar base long-duration space missions a number of large observatories and eventually the wet workshop space station in the case of the atm the initial idea was to mount the instrumentation in a deployable unit attached to the service module this was then changed to use a modified apollo lunar module to house controls observation instruments and recording systems while the lunar descent stage was replaced with a large solar telescope and solar panels to power it all after launch it would be met in orbit by a three-crew apollo csm who would operate it and retrieve data before returning to earth as many of the other concepts were dropped eventually only the space station and atm remained on the books the plans then changed to launch the atm and have it connect to skylab in orbit both spacecraft would then be operated by the skylab crews with the cancellation of the later apollo landing missions providing a saturn v the wet workshop concept was no longer needed instead the plans were changed to orbit an expanded dry version of the station the atm would now be launched attached to the station as the saturn v had enough power to launch them both at the same time this change saved the skylab program when a problem during launch destroyed one of the workshop solar panels and prevented the other from automatically deploying the windmill-like arrays on the atm which fed power to both the atm and the station remained undamaged due to the protection within the launch shroud and provided enough power for manned operations until the one remaining workshop array could be deployed during the first manned mission there were additional astronomical and earth observation experiments aboard skylab during development the atm was subjected to thermal vacuum testing instruments there were 8 major solar studies instruments on the mount combined they could observe the sun in light wavelengths from 2 to 7000 angstroms which corresponds to soft x-ray ultraviolet and visible light two x-ray telescopes extreme ultraviolet spectroheliograph ultraviolet spectroheliometer ultraviolet spectrograph visible light coronagraph two hydrogen alpha telescopes same instruments by designation the x-ray instruments included s-054 s-056 s-020 x-ray and extreme ultraviolet camera uv instruments included s-082a extreme ultraviolet spectroheliograph s-082b ultraviolet spectroheliometer s-055 ultraviolet spectrograph hydrogen alpha and coronograph h-alpha no 1 h-alpha no 2 s-052 a coronagraph also experiment s149 was attached to one of the atm solar panels film canisters six atm experiments used film to record data and over the course of the missions over 150000 successful exposures were recorded the film canister had to be manually retrieved on manned spacewalks to the instruments during the missions the film canisters were returned to earth aboard the apollo capsules when each mission ended and were among the heaviest items that had to be returned at the end of each mission the heaviest canisters weighed 40kg 881 lb and could hold up to 16000 frames of film over the course of operations almost 30 canisters were loaded and utilized and then returned to earth results experiments the instruments were used for various types of observations including pre-planned experiements including a set of student experiments this is a chart describing an example of this s-54 x-ray spectrographic telesope legacy a backup atm spar instruments were mounted to this was restored at put on display in 2015 at the steven f udvar-hazy center in chantilly virginia us the restoration involved repairing some kapton layers that had degraded after 4
