in the united states in 1845 it was a principal location of the seminole wars against the native americans and racial segregation after the american civil war today florida is distinctive for its large cuban expatriate community and high population growth as well as for its increasing environmental issues the states economy relies mainly on tourism agriculture and transportation which developed in the late 19th century florida is also renowned for amusement parks orange crops winter vegetables the kennedy space center and as a popular destination for retirees florida is the flattest state in the united states lake okeechobee is the largest freshwater lake in the us state of florida floridas close proximity to the ocean influences many aspects of florida culture and daily

american alligator american crocodile american flamingo roseate spoonbill florida panther bottlenose dolphin and manatee can be found in everglades national park in the southern part of the state along with hawaii florida is one of only two states that has a tropical climate and is the only continental state with either a tropical climate or a coral reef the florida reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental united states and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world after the great barrier reef and belize barrier reef history by the 16th century the earliest time for which there is a historical record major native american groups included the apalachee of the florida panhandle the timucua of northern and central florida the ais of the central atlantic coast the tocobaga of the tampa bay area the calusa of southwest florida and the tequesta of the southeastern coast european arrival florida was the first region of the continental united states to be visited and settled by europeans the earliest known european explorers came with the spanish conquistador juan ponce de len ponce de len spotted and landed on the peninsula on april 2 1513 he named the region florida land of flowers the story that he was searching for the fountain of youth is mythical and only appeared long after his death in may 1539 conquistador hernando de soto skirted the coast of florida searching for a deep harbor to land he described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile some reaching as high as 70 feet 21m with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult the spanish introduced christianity cattle horses sheep the castilian language and more to florida spain established several settlements in florida with varying degrees of success in 1559 don tristn de luna y arellano established a settlement at present-day pensacola making it the first attempted settlement in florida but it was mostly abandoned by 1561 in 1565 the settlement of st augustine san agustn was established under the leadership of admiral and governor pedro menndez de avils creating what would become one of the oldest continuously-occupied european settlements in the continental us and establishing the first generation of floridanos and the government of florida spain maintained strategic control over the region by converting the local tribes to christianity the marriage between luisa de abrego a free black domestic servant from seville and miguel rodrguez a white segovian occurred in 1565 in st augustine it is the first recorded christian marriage in the continental united states some spanish married or had unions with pensacola creek or african women both slave and free and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos the spanish encouraged slaves from the southern british colonies to come to florida as a refuge promising freedom in exchange for conversion to catholicism king charles ii of spain issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to spanish florida and accepted conversion and baptism most went to the area around st augustine but escaped slaves also reached pensacola st augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending spain as early as 1683 the geographical area of florida diminished with the establishment of english settlements to the north and french claims to the west the english attacked st augustine burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times spain built the castillo de san marcos in 1672 and fort matanzas in 1742 to defend floridas capital city from attacks and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the captaincy general of cuba and the spanish west indies florida attracted numerous africans and african americans from adjacent british colonies who sought freedom from slavery in 1738 governor manuel de montiano established fort gracia real de santa teresa de mose near st augustine a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the florida militia and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in north america in 1763 spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana cuba which had been captured by the british during the seven years war it was part of a large expansion of british territory following their victory in the seven years war a large portion of the floridano population left taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to cuba the british soon constructed the kings road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point called wacca pilatka or the british name cow ford ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there the british divided and consolidated the florida provinces las floridas into east florida and west florida a division the spanish government kept after the brief british period the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement in order to induce settlers to move to florida reports of its natural wealth were published in england a large number of british settlers who were described as being energetic and of good character moved to florida mostly coming from south carolina georgia and england there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda this would be the first permanent english-speaking population in what is now duval county baker county st johns county and nassau county the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well as the export of lumber the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were with the advice of councils to establish courts this was the first introduction of the english-derived legal system which florida still has today including trial by jury habeas corpus and county-based government neither east florida nor west florida sent any representatives to philadelphia to draft the declaration of independence florida remained a loyalist stronghold for the duration of the american revolution spain regained both east and west florida after britains defeat in the american revolution and the subsequent treaty of versailles in 1783 and continued the provincial divisions until 1821 joining the united states indian removal defense of floridas northern border with the united states was minor during the second spanish period the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against us territories and the us pressed spain for reform americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities and the floridan government they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to immigrate into florida unchecked these migrants mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period would be the progenitors of the population known as florida crackers these american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish authorities the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called free and independent republic of west florida on september 23 after meetings beginning in june rebels overcame the garrison at baton rouge now in louisiana and unfurled the flag of the new republic a single white star on a blue field this flag would later become known as the bonnie blue flag in 1810 parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans the us annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812 spain continued to dispute the area though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied in 1812 a group of settlers from georgia with de facto support from the us federal government attempted to overthrow the floridan government in the province of east florida the settlers hoped to convince floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from spain but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813 seminoles based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves the united states army led increasingly frequent incursions into spanish territory including the 18171818 campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war the united states now effectively controlled east florida control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy civilized or savage of the united states and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them florida had become a burden to spain which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the united states through the adamsons treaty which took effect in 1821 president james monroe was authorized on march 3 1821 to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial governance andrew jackson on behalf of the us federal government served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory for a brief period on march 30 1822 the us congress merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida territory by the early 1800s indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern us and also in florida in 1830 the us congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased pressure grew on the us government to remove the indians from florida seminoles offered sanctuary to blacks and these became known as the black seminoles and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers in 1832 the treaty of paynes landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida many seminole left at this time some seminoles remained and the us army arrived in florida leading to the second seminole war 18351842 following the war approximately 3000 seminole and 800 black seminole were removed to indian territory a few hundred seminole remained in florida in the everglades on march 3 1845 florida became the 27th state to join the united states of america the state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves initially its population grew slowly as european settlers continued to encroach on seminole lands and the united states intervened to move the remaining seminoles to the west the third seminole war 185558 resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining seminoles although hundreds of seminole indians remained in the everglades slavery war and disenfranchisement american settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north florida which required numerous laborers which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market by 1860 florida had only 140424 people of whom 44 were enslaved there were fewer than 1000 free african americans before the american civil war on january 10 1861 nearly all delegates in the florida legislature approved an ordinance of secession declaring florida to be a sovereign and independent nationan apparent reassertion to the preamble in floridas constitution of 1838 in which florida agreed with congress to be a free and independent state although not directly related to the issue of slavery the ordinance declared floridas secession from the union allowing it to become one of the founding members of the confederate states a looser union of states the confederal union received little help from florida the 15000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee on february 20 1864 and the battle of natural bridge on march 6 1865 both were confederate victories the war ended in 1865 following the american civil war floridas congressional representation was restored on june 25 1868 albeit forcefully after radical reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders after the reconstruction period ended in 1876 white democrats regained power in the state legislature in 1885 they created a new constitution followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites until the mid-20th century florida was the least populous state in the southern united states in 1900 its population was only 528542 of whom nearly 44 were african american the same proportion as before the civil war the boll weevil devastated cotton crops forty thousand blacks roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population left the state in the great migration they left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage 20th and 21st century growth historically floridas economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle sugar cane citrus fruits tomatoes and strawberries economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s which brought a brief period of intense land development devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 followed by the great depression brought that period to a halt floridas economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii in 1939 florida was described as still very largely an empty state subsequently the growing availability of air conditioning the climate and a low cost of living made the state a haven migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased floridas population after 1945 in the 1960s many refugees from cuba fleeing fidel castros communist regime arrived in miami at the freedom tower where the federal government used the facility to process document and provide medical and dental services for the newcomers as a result the freedom tower was also called the ellis island of the south in recent decades more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy with a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census florida is the most populous state in the southeastern united states and the third-most populous in the united states after hurricane maria devastated puerto rico in september 2017 a large population of puerto ricans began moving to florida to escape the widespread destruction hundreds of thousands of puerto ricans arrived in florida after maria dissipated with nearly half of them arriving in orlando and large populations also moving to tampa fort lauderdale and west palm beach geography much of florida is on a peninsula between the gulf of mexico the atlantic ocean and the straits of florida spanning two time zones it extends to the northwest into a panhandle extending along the northern gulf of mexico it is bordered on the north by georgia and alabama and on the west at the end of the panhandle by alabama it is the only state that borders the atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico florida also is the southernmost state in the 48 contiguous states with hawaii being the only state reaching farther south florida is west of the bahamas and 90 miles 140km north of cuba florida is one of the largest states east of the mississippi river and only alaska and michigan are larger in water area the water boundary is 3 nautical miles 35mi 56km offshore in the atlantic ocean and 9 nautical miles 10mi 17km offshore in the gulf of mexico at 345 feet 105m above mean sea level britton hill is the highest point in florida and the lowest highpoint of any us state much of the state south of orlando lies at a lower elevation than northern florida and is fairly level much of the state is at or near sea level however some places such as clearwater have promontories that rise 50 to 100ft 15 to 30m above the water much of central and north florida typically 25mi 40km or more away from the coastline have rolling hills with elevations ranging from 100 to 250ft 30 to 76m the highest point in peninsular florida east and south of the suwannee river sugarloaf mountain is a 312-foot 95m peak in lake county on average florida is the flattest state in the united states climate the climate of florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is distant from the ocean north of lake okeechobee the prevalent climate is humid subtropical kppen cfa while areas south of the lake including the florida keys have a true tropical climate kppen aw mean high temperatures for late july are primarily in the low 90s fahrenheit 3234c mean low temperatures for early to mid january range from the low 40s fahrenheit 47c in north florida to above 60f 16c from miami on southward with an average daily temperature of 707f 215c it is the warmest state in the us in the summer high temperatures in the state seldom exceed 100f 38c several record cold maxima have been in the 30s f 1 to 4c and record lows have been in the 10s 12 to 7c these temperatures normally extend at most a few days at a time in the northern and central parts of florida south florida however rarely encounters below freezing temperatures the hottest temperature ever recorded in florida was 109f 43c which was set on june 29 1931 in monticello the coldest temperature was 2f 19c on february 13 1899 just 25 miles 40km away in tallahassee due to its subtropical and tropical climate florida rarely receives measurable snowfall however on rare occasions a combination of cold moisture and freezing temperatures can result in snowfall in the farthest northern regions like jacksonville gainesville or pensacola frost which is more common than snow sometimes occurs in the panhandle the usda plant hardiness zones for the state range from zone 8a no colder than 10f or 12c in the inland western panhandle to zone 11b no colder than 45f or 7c in the lower florida keys fog also occurs all over the state or climate of florida floridas nickname is the sunshine state but severe weather is a common occurrence in the state central florida is known as the lightning capital of the united states as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country florida has one of the highest average precipitation levels of any state in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in much of the state from late spring until early autumn a narrow eastern part of the state including orlando and jacksonville receives between 2400 and 2800 hours of sunshine annually the rest of the state including miami receives between 2800 and 3200 hours annually florida leads the united states in tornadoes per area when including waterspouts but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the midwest and great plains hail often accompanies the most severe thunderstorms hurricanes pose a severe threat each year during june 1 to november 30 hurricane season particularly from august to october florida is the most hurricane-prone state with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the united states 83 have either hit florida or texas from 1851 to 2006 florida was struck by 114 hurricanes 37 of them majorcategory 3 and above it is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm in 1992 florida was the site of what was then the costliest weather disaster in us history hurricane andrew which caused more than 25billion in damages when it struck during august it held that distinction until 2005 when hurricane katrina surpassed it and it has since been surpassed by six other hurricanes andrew is currently the second costliest hurricane in floridas history fauna florida is host to many types of wildlife including marine mammals bottlenose dolphin short-finned pilot whale north atlantic right whale west indian manatee mammals florida panther northern river otter mink eastern cottontail rabbit marsh rabbit raccoon striped skunk squirrel white-tailed deer key deer bobcats red fox gray fox coyote wild boar florida black bear nine-banded armadillos virginia opossum reptiles eastern diamondback and pygmy rattlesnakes gopher tortoise

caracara snail kite osprey white and brown pelicans sea gulls whooping and sandhill cranes roseate spoonbill american white ibis florida scrub jay state endemic and others one subspecies of wild turkey meleagris gallopavo namely subspecies osceola is found only in florida the state is a wintering location for many species of eastern north american birds as a result of climate change there have been small numbers of several new species normally native to cooler areas to the north snowy owls snow buntings harlequin ducks and razorbills these have been seen in the northern part of the state invertebrates carpenter ants termites american cockroach africanized bees the miami blue butterfly and the grizzled mantis florida also has more than 500 nonnative animal species and 1000 nonnative insects found throughout the state some exotic species living in florida include the burmese python green iguana veiled chameleon argentine black and white tegu peacock bass mayan cichlid lionfish white-nosed coati rhesus macaque vervet monkey cuban tree frog cane toad indian peafowl monk parakeet tui parakeet and many more some of these nonnative species do not pose a threat to any native species but some do threaten the native species of florida by living in the state and eating them flora there are about 3000 different types of wildflowers in florida this is the third-most diverse state in the union behind california and texas both larger states in florida wild populations of coconut palms extend up the east coast from key west to jupiter inlet and up the west coast from marco island to sarasota many of the smallest coral islands in the florida keys are known to have abundant coconut palms sprouting from coconuts that have drifted or been deposited by ocean currents coconut palms are cultivated north of south florida to roughly cocoa beach on the east coast and the tampa bay area on the west coast on the east coast of the state mangroves have normally dominated the coast from cocoa beach southward salt marshes from st augustine northward from st augustine south to cocoa beach the coast fluctuates between the two depending on the annual weather conditions all three mangrove species flower in the spring and early summer propagules fall from late summer through early autumn florida mangrove plant communities covered an estimated 430000 to 540000 acres 1700 to 2200km in florida in 1981 ninety percent of the florida mangroves are in southern florida in collier lee miami-dade and monroe counties florida reef the florida reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental united states it is also the third largest coral barrier reef system in the world after the great barrier reef and the belize barrier reef the reef lies a little bit off of the coast of the florida keys a lot of the reef lies within john pennekamp coral reef state park which was the first underwater park in the united states the park contains a lot of tropical vegetation marine life and seabirds the florida reef extends into other parks and sanctuaries as well including dry tortugas national park biscayne national park and the florida keys national marine sanctuary almost 1400 species of marine plants and animals including more than 40 species of stony corals and 500 species of fish live on the florida reef the florida reef being a delicate ecosystem like other coral reefs faces many threats including overfishing plastics in the ocean coral bleaching rising sea levels and changes in sea surface temperature environmental issues florida is a low per capita energy user it is estimated that approximately 4 of energy in the state is generated through renewable resources floridas energy production is 6 of the nations total energy output while total production of pollutants is lower with figures of 6 for nitrogen oxide 5 for carbon dioxide and 4 for sulfur dioxide wildfires in florida occur at all times of the year all potable water resources have been controlled by the state government through five regional water authorities since 1972 red tide has been an issue on the southwest coast of florida as well as other areas while there has been a great deal of conjecture over the cause of the toxic algae bloom there is no evidence that it is being caused by pollution or that there has been an increase in the duration or frequency of red tides red tide is now killing off wildlife or tropical fish and coral reefs putting all in danger the florida panther is close to extinction a record 23 were killed in 2009 mainly by automobile collisions leaving about 100 individuals in the wild the center for biological diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction american flamingos are rare to see in florida due to being hunted in the 1900s where it was to a point considered completely extirpated now the flamingos are reproducing toward making a comeback to south florida since it is adamantly considered native to the state and also are now being protected much of florida has an elevation of less than 12 feet 37m including many populated areas therefore it is susceptible to rising sea levels associated with global warming the atlantic beaches that are vital to the states economy are being washed out to sea due to rising sea levels caused by climate change the miami beach area close to the continental shelf is running out of accessible offshore sand reserves elevated temperatures can damage coral reefs causing coral bleaching the first recorded bleaching incident on the florida reef was in 1973 incidents of bleaching have become more frequent in recent decades in correlation with a rise in sea surface temperatures white band disease has also adversely affected corals on the florida reef geology the florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the florida platform the largest deposits of potash in the united states are found in florida the largest deposits of rock phosphate in the country are found in florida most of this is in bone valley extended systems of underwater caves sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents the limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell during the last glacial period lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula largely savanna while there are sinkholes in much of the state modern sinkholes have tended to be in west-central florida everglades national park covers 1509000 acres 6110km throughout dade monroe and collier counties in florida the everglades an enormously wide slow-flowing river encompasses the southern tip of the peninsula sinkhole damage claims on property in the state exceeded a total of 2billion from 2006 through 2010 winter park sinkhole in central florida appeared may 8 1981 it was approximately 350 feet 107m wide and 75 feet 23m deep it was notable as one of the largest recent sinkholes to form in the united states it is now known as lake rose the econlockhatchee river econ river for short is an 877-kilometer-long 545mi north-flowing blackwater tributary of the st johns river the longest river in the us state of florida the econ river flows through osceola orange and seminole counties in central florida just east of the orlando metropolitan area east of state road 417 it is a designated outstanding florida waters earthquakes are rare because florida is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries regions demographics population the united states census bureau estimates that the

of 1965 providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for african americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement that had excluded most of them for decades from the political process from the 1930s through much of the 1960s florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative democrats who together with other democrats of the solid south exercised considerable control in congress they have gained slightly less federal money from national programs than they have paid in taxes since the 1970s conservative white voters in the state have largely shifted from the democratic to the republican party though the majority of registered voters in florida are democrats it continued to support republican presidential candidates through 2004 except in 1976 and 1996 when the democratic nominee was from the south in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections

proportion 2008 marked the first time since 1944 when franklin d roosevelt carried the state for the fourth time that florida was carried by a northern democrat for president the first post-reconstruction era republican elected to congress from florida was william c cramer in 1954 from pinellas county on the gulf coast where demographic changes were underway in this period african americans were still disenfranchised by the states constitution and discriminatory practices in the 19th century they had made up most of the republican party cramer built a different republican party

upset election in 1968 edward j gurney also a white conservative was elected as the states first post-reconstruction republican us senator in 1970 democrats took the governorship and the open us

voted for a losing candidate only twice in 1998 democratic voters dominated areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white liberals from the northeastern united states known colloquially as snowbirds south florida and the miami metropolitan area are dominated by both racial minorities and white liberals because of this the area has consistently voted as one of the most democratic areas of the state the daytona beach area is similar demographically and the city of orlando has a large hispanic population which has often favored democrats republicans made

court by supporters of the above amendments the court ruled in 2014 after lengthy testimony that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering after this was appealed in july 2015
