apollo 8 the second manned spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program was launched on december 21 1968 and became the first manned spacecraft to leave low earth orbit reach the moon orbit it and return the three-astronaut crewfrank borman james lovell and william anderswere the first humans to witness and photograph an earthrise and to escape the gravity of a celestial body apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn v rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center located adjacent to cape canaveral air force station in florida originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 the mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitts crew who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became the crew for the apollo 9 mission and bormans crew were moved to the apollo 8 mission this left bormans crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training apollo 8 took 68 hours almost three days to travel the distance to the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours during which they made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever apollo 8s successful mission paved the way for apollo 11 to fulfill us president john f kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s the apollo 8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 1968 when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean the crew members were named time magazines men of the year for 1968 upon their return background in the late 1950s and early 1960s the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october 4 1957 the soviet union launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president john f kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning the soviet union had better booster rockets which meant that kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality something spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such a project to land a man on the moon and return him to the earth this project already had a name project apollo an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that would return to earth a service module sm to provide the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a two-stage lunar module lm which comprised a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by the saturn v rocket that was then under development framework prime crew the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november 20 1967 collins was replaced by jim lovell in july 1968 after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among pre-space shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini vii and gemini xii this would also be the first case of a commander of a previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as a non-commander backup crew the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command apollo 11 with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on the backup crew of apollo 11 as lmp and flew on apollo 13 as lmp support personnel during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes the support crew developed procedures in the simulators especially those for emergency situations so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for apollo 8 the support crew consisted of ken mattingly vance brand and gerald carr the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo 8 the capcoms were michael collins gerald carr ken mattingly neil armstrong buzz aldrin vance brand and fred haise the mission control teams rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director the directors for apollo 8 were clifford e charlesworth green team glynn lunney black team and milton windler maroon team mission insignia and callsign the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm it shows a red figure 8 looping around the earth and moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission on the bottom of the 8 are the names of the three astronauts the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a t-38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of the apollo 8s re-designation as a lunar-orbital mission the crew wanted to name their spacecraft but nasa did not allow it the crew would have likely chosen columbiad the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon the apollo 11 cm was named columbia in part for that reason preparations mission schedule on september 20 1967 nasa adopted a seven-step plan for apollo missions with the final step being a moon landing apollo 4 and apollo 6 were a missions tests of the saturn v launch vehicle using an unmanned block i production model of the command and service module csm in earth orbit apollo 5 was a b mission a test of the lm in earth orbit apollo 7 scheduled for october 1968 would be a c mission a manned earth-orbit flight of the csm further missions depended on the readiness of the lm it had been decided as early as may 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions apollo 8 was planned as the d mission a test of the lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart while bormans crew would fly the e mission a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo 9 in early 1969 the f mission would test the csm and lm in lunar orbit and the g mission would be the finale the moon landing production of the lm fell behind schedule and when apollo 8s lm-3 arrived at the kennedy space center ksc in june 1968 over 100 significant defects were discovered leading bob gilruth the director of the manned spacecraft center msc and others to conclude that there was no prospect of lm-3 being ready to fly in 1968 indeed it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march 1969 following the original seven-step plan would have meant delaying the d and subsequent missions and endangering the programs goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969 george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august 1968 to keep the program on track despite the lm delay since the next csm designated as csm-103 would be ready three months before lm-3 a csm-only mission could be flown in december 1968 instead of repeating the c mission flight of apollo 7 this csm could be sent all the way to the moon with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo 10 the scheduled f mission this also meant that the medium earth orbit e mission could be dispensed with the net result was that only the d mission had to be delayed and the plan for lunar landing in mid-1969 could remain on timeline on august 9 1968 low discussed the idea with gilruth flight director chris kraft and the director of flight crew operations donald slayton they then flew to the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama where they met with ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel c phillips rocco petrone and wernher von braun kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn v as-503 could be made ready by december 1 and von braun was confident that the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollo 6 had been fixed almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator backed by the full support of his agency webb authorized the mission apollo 8 was officially changed from a d mission to a c-prime lunar-orbit mission with the change in mission for apollo 8 slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it mcdivitt turned it down his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the lm and that was what he still wanted to do slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the d and e missions this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring bormans crew to use csm-103 while mcdivitts crew would use csm-104 since cm-104 could not be made ready by december david scott was not happy about giving up cm-103 the testing of which he had closely supervised for cm-104 although the two were almost identical and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm instead in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance apollo 8 would carry a lm test article a boilerplate model of lm-3 added pressure on the apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the soviet unions zond 5 mission which flew some living creatures including russian tortoises in a cislunar loop around the moon and returned them to earth on september 21 there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968 the apollo 8 crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his 1927 flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the next day the lindberghs watched the launch of apollo 8 from a nearby dune saturn v redesign the saturn v rocket used by apollo 8 was designated as-503 or the 03rd model of the saturn v 5 rocket to be used in the apollo-saturn as program when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december 20 1967 it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned earth-orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command and service module apollo 6 had suffered several major problems during its april 1968 flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two second-stage engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the saturn v was ready teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant g-forces on a crew a task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it had accidentally shut down engine threes liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection as a result engine three failed within one second of engine twos shutdown further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine a faulty igniter line the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches the teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at the msfc a saturn stage ic was equipped with shock-absorbing devices to demonstrate the teams solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved they gave their approval for a manned mission using as-503 the apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september 21 and the rocket made the slow 3-mile 48km journey to the launch pad on october 9 testing continued all through december until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from december 5 through 11 final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 three days before the scheduled launch mission parameter summary as the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollo 8s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal 100-nautical-mile 1852km circular earth parking orbit apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of 9999 nautical miles 18518km and a perigee of 9957 nautical miles 18440km with an inclination of 3251 to the equator and an orbital period of 8819 minutes propellant venting increased the apogee by 64 nautical miles 119km over the 2 hours 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit this was followed by a trans-lunar injection tli burn of the s-ivb third stage for 318 seconds accelerating the 63650lb 28870kg command and service module and 19900lb 9000kg lm test article from an orbital velocity of 25567 feet per second 7793ms to the injection velocity of 35505fts 10822ms which set a record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of 36747 feet per second 11200ms but put apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit close enough to the moon to be captured by the moons gravity the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60-nautical-mile 110km circular orbit above the moons surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of 600 nautical miles 1111km and an apolune of 1685 nautical miles 3121km at an inclination of 12 from the lunar equator this was then circularized at 607 nautical miles 1124km by 597 nautical miles 1106km with an orbital period of 1287 minutes the effect of lunar mass concentrations mascons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours the orbital distance was perturbated to 636 nautical miles 1178km by 586 nautical miles 1085km apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of 203752 nautical miles 234474 statute miles 377349 kilometers launch and trans-lunar injection apollo 8 launched at 125100 utc 075100 eastern standard time on december 21 1968 using the saturn vs three stages to achieve earth orbit the s-ic first stage landed in the atlantic ocean at 3012n 747w 30200n 74117w 30200 -74117 apollo 8 s-ic impact and the s-ii second stage landed at 3150n 3717w 31833n 37283w 31833 -37283 apollo 8 s-ii impact the s-ivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon once the vehicle reached earth orbit both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next 2 hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli the proper operation of the s-ivb third stage of the rocket was crucial and in the last unmanned test it had failed to reignite for this burn collins was the first capcom on duty and at 2 hours 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed apollo 8 you are go for tli this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollo 8 to go to the moon the s-ivb engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly over the next five minutes the spacecrafts speed increased from 7600 to 10800 meters per second 25000 to 35000fts after the s-ivb had placed the mission on course for the moon the command and service modules csm the remaining apollo 8 spacecraft separated from it the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this marked the first time humans had viewed the whole earth at once borman became worried that the s-ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the small reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module sm to add 11fts 034ms to their velocity away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the s-ivb after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed but at 77fts 23ms instead the time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks five hours after launch mission control sent a command to the s-ivb to vent its remaining fuel changing its trajectory the s-ivb with the test article attached posed no further hazard to apollo 8 passing the orbit of the moon and going into a 099-by-092-astronomical-unit 148 by 138gm solar orbit with an inclination of 2347 from the plane of the ecliptic and an orbital period of 34080 days it became a derelict object and will continue to orbit the sun for many years the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to 15000 miles 24000km from earth scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecrafts high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x-ray or 1 milligray mgy during a year the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mgy to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 16 mgy lunar trajectory lovells main job as command module pilot was as navigator although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earths or the moons horizon this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft which made it hard to distinguish the stars by seven hours into the mission the crew was about 1 hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the s-ivb and lovells obscured star sightings the crew placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft in direct sunlight parts of the spacecrafts outer surface could be heated to over 200c 392f while the parts in shadow would be 100c 148f these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft swept out a cone as it rotated the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger the first mid-course correction came eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours before launch nasa had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only 24 seconds and added about 204fts 62ms velocity prograde in the direction of travel this change was less than the planned 248fts 76ms because of a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the apollo 8 trajectory was found to be perfect about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill the pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which the crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second-floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floors only one of which was used during a mission the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a 24-hour flu as borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut russell schweickart during apollo 9 the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch the apollo 8 crew used a 2-kilogram 44lb camera that broadcast in black-and-white only using a vidicon tube the camera had two lenses a very wide-angle 160 lens and a telephoto 9 lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible additionally without proper filters the earth image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob after broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high-gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep 32 and a half hours into the flight3 and a half hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for passive thermal control it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth what was visible and the colors they could see the transmission lasted 23 minutes lunar sphere of influence at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit the crew of apollo 8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body in other words the effect of the moons gravitational force on apollo 8 became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened apollo 8 was 38759 miles 62377km from the moon and had a speed of 3990fts 1220ms relative to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was a second mid-course correction it was in retrograde against the direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by 20fts 061ms effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly 61 hours after launch about 24200 miles 38900km from the moon the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds they would now pass 717 miles 1154km from the lunar surface at 64 hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion 1 loi-1 this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a gono go decision the crew was told at 68 hours that they were go and riding the best bird we can find lovell replied well see you on the other side and for the first time in history humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with 10 minutes remaining before loi-1 the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit the sps was ignited at 69 hours 8 minutes and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4 minutes and 7 seconds placing the apollo 8 spacecraft in orbit around the moon the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space if it had lasted too long they could have struck the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next 20 hours on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon exactly at the calculated moment however the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a 1933-by-695-mile 3111 by 1118km orbit around the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like the moon is essentially grey no color looks like plaster of paris or sort of a grayish beach sand we can see quite a bit of detail the sea of fertility doesnt stand out as well here as it does back on earth theres not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters the craters are all rounded off theres quite a few of them some of them are newer many of them look likeespecially the round oneslook like hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort langrenus is quite a huge crater its got a central cone to it the walls of the crater are terraced about six or seven different terraces on the way down lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the apollo 11 landing site the launch time of apollo 8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew had taken over eight hundred 70mm still photographs and 700 feet 210m of 16mm movie film throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a gono go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed an 11-second loi-2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to 700 by 713 miles 1127 by 1147km throughout the next two orbits the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christophers episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo 8 flight he was unable to attend a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service earthrise when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed an earthrise in person for the first time in human history nasas lunar orbiter 1 had taken the first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august 23 1966 anders saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise a now famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface this is because as seen from any one place on the moons surface earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky either above or below the horizon earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon and at selected surface locations near the moons limb where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed anders initially protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the astronauts began the second television transmission borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth each man on board read a section from the biblical creation story from the book of genesis borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from the crew of apollo 8 we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of youall of you on the good earth the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the trans-earth injection tei which was scheduled for 22 hours after the end of the television transmission the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth the burn occurred exactly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the moon at 89 hours 28 minutes and 39 seconds the exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied thats affirmative you are the best ones to know the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 christmas day unplanned manual realignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard however he accidentally erased some of the computers memory which caused the inertial measurement unit imu to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before lift-off the imu then fired the thrusters to correct the modules attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the modules actual orientation it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later during the apollo 13 mission lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after the modules imu had to be turned off to conserve energy cruise back to earth and reentry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would reenter earths atmosphere two-and-half days after tei and splash down in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after the flight there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the next day at about 124 hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth during a four-minute broadcast after two uneventful days the crew prepared for reentry the computer would control the reentry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude with the blunt end forward in the event of computer failure borman was ready to take over separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earths horizon just as had been calculated by the trajectory specialists as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 standard gravities 59ms with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft apollo 8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at 30000 feet 91km the drogue parachute deployed stabilizing the spacecraft followed at 10000 feet 30km by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as 88n 1651w 8133n 165017w 8133 -165017 apollo 8 estimated splashdown in the north pacific ocean southwest of hawaii at 155142 utc on december 27 1968 when the spacecraft hit the water the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down in what was termed stable 2 position as they were buffeted by a 10-foot 30m swell borman was sick waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft about six minutes after splashdown the command module was righted into a normal apex-up orientation by its inflatable bag uprighting system the first frogman from aircraft carrier ussyorktown arrived 43 minutes after splashdown forty-five minutes later the crew was safe on the flight deck of the yorktown legacy historical importance apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine chose the crew of apollo 8 as its men of the year for 1968 recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a fifty-fifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo 8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that stated simply thank you apollo 8 you saved 1968 one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture while actually behind the camera and it has been credited as one of the inspirations of the first earth day in 1970 it was selected as the first of life magazines 100 photographs that changed the world apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said eights momentous historic significance was foremost while space historian robert k poole saw apollo 8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury-atlas 6 by john glenn in 1962 there were 1200 journalists covering the mission with the bbcs coverage broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of the soviet interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saweither live or delayedthe christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the apollo 8 broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences madalyn murray ohair an atheist later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis ohair wanted the courts to ban american astronautswho were all government employeesfrom public prayer in space though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states for lack of jurisdiction it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo 11 self-communicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and referred to it only obliquely at the time in 1969 the united states postal service issued a postage stamp scott catalogue 1371 commemorating the apollo 8 flight around the moon the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning god the first words of the book of genesis in january 1969 just 18 days after the crews return to earth they appeared in the super bowl iii pre-game show reciting the pledge of allegiance before the national anthem was performed by anita bryant spacecraft location in january 1970 the spacecraft was delivered to osaka japan for display in the us pavilion at expo 70 it is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the space suit worn by frank borman jim lovells apollo 8 space suit is on public display in the visitor center at nasas glenn research center bill anderss space suit is on display at the science museum in london united kingdom in popular culture apollo 8s historic mission has been depicted and referred to in several forms both documentary and fiction the various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of apollo 8 were compiled and released by nasa in the 1969 documentary debrief apollo 8 hosted by burgess meredith in addition spacecraft films released in 2003 a three-disc dvd set containing all of nasas tv and 16mm film footage related to the mission including all tv transmissions from space training and launch footage and motion pictures taken in flight other documentaries include race to the moon 2005 as part of season 18 of american experience and in the shadow of the moon 2007 parts of the mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon episode 1968 the s-ivb stage of apollo 8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 ufo episode
