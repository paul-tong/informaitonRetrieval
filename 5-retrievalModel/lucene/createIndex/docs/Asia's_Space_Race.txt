several asian countries have space programs and are actively competing to achieve scientific and technological advancements in space a situation sometimes referred to as the asian space race in the popular media as a reference to the earlier space race between the united states and the soviet union like the previous space race issues involved in the current push to space include national security which has spurred many countries to send artificial satellites as well as humans into earth orbit and beyond a number of asian countries are seen as contenders in the ongoing race to be the pre-eminent power in space asian space powers of the ten countries that have independently successfully launched a satellite into orbit six are asian china india iran israel japan and north korea chinas first manned spacecraft entered orbit in october 2003 making china the first asian nation to send a human into space india expects to send astronauts to space in the gaganyaan capsule by 2022 while the achievements of space programs run by the main asian space players china india and japan pale in comparison to the milestones set by the former soviet union and the united states some experts believe asia may soon lead the world in space exploration china has been the leader of asias space race since the beginning of the 21st century the first chinese manned spaceflight in 2003 marked the beginning of a space race in the region at the same time the existence of a space race in asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the united states and the soviet union japan for example was the first power on earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid there was however some concurrence between china and india to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the earths moon back in the late 2000s decade china for example denies that there is an asian space race in january 2007 china became the first asian military-space power to send an anti-satellite missile into orbit to destroy an aging chinese feng yun 1c weather satellite in polar orbit the resulting explosion sent a wave of debris hurtling through space at more than 6miles per second a month later japans space agency launched an experimental communications satellite designed to enable super high-speed data transmission in remote areas after successful achievement of geostationary technology indias isro launched its first moon mission chandrayaan-1 in october 2008 which discovered ice water on the moon india then launched on 5 november 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission the mars orbiter mission the primary objective is to determine mars atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane the spacecraft completed its journey on 24 september 2014 when it entered its intended orbit around mars making india the first asian country to successfully place a mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt isro became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to mars only behind nasa roscosmos and esa in addition to increasing national pride countries are commercially motivated to operate in space commercial satellites are launched for communications weather forecasting and atmospheric research according to a report by the space frontier foundation released in 2006 the space economy is estimated to be worth about 180billion with more than 60 of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services china and india propose the initiation of a commercial launch service china china has a space program with an independent human spaceflight capability it has developed a sizable family of successful long march rockets it has launched two lunar orbiters change 1 and change 2 on 2 december 2013 china launched a modified long march 3b rocket with change 3 moon lander and its rover yutu on-board toward the moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations becoming the third country to do so it also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017 in 2011 china embarked on a program to establish a manned space station starting with the launch of tiangong 1 and followed by tiangong 2 in 2016 china attempted to send a mars orbiter yinghuo-1 in 2011 on a joint mission with russia which failed to leave earth orbit nevertheless the 2020 chinese mars mission with an orbiter a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020 china has collaborative projects with russia esa and brazil and has launched commercial satellites for other countries some analysts suggest that the chinese space program is linked to the nations efforts at developing advanced military technology chinas advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences early chinese satellites such as the fsw series have undergone many atmospheric reentry tests in the 1990s china had commercial launches resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s china has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like solar system exploration chinas shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an eva in september 2008 chinas shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in june 2012 furthermore chinas change 2 explorer became the first object to reach sun-earth lagrangian point in august 2011 and also the first probe to explore both moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid 4179 toutatis china has launched dampe the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015 and worlds first quantum communication satellite quess in 2016 india indias interest in space travel began in the early 1960s when scientists launched a nike-apache rocket from terls kerala under vikram sarabhai the program focused on the practical uses of space in increasing the standard of living remote sensing and communications satellites were placed into orbit the first indian to travel in space was rakesh sharma who flew aboard soyuz t-11 launched april 2 1984 from erstwhile ussr just a few days after china said that it would send a human into orbit in the second half of 2003 indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee publicly urged his countrys scientists to work towards sending a man to the moon it successfully sent its probe to the moon in october 2008 and is planning its second moon mission chandrayaan-2 for 2019 isro launched its mars orbiter mission on november 5 2013 informally called mangalyaan which successfully entered into the orbit around mars on 24 september 2014 india is the first in asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful mars mission it is also the only one to do so on the first attempt and at a record low cost of 74 million isro has demonstrated its re-entry technology and till date has launched as many as 175 foreign satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries including us germany france japan canada uk all of these have been launched successfully by pslvs so far gaining significant expertise in space technologies in june 2016 india set a record by launching 20 satellites simultaneously the pslvs are also one of worlds most reliable launch vehicles which clocked its 35th successful mission 39 total in a row as of february 2017 thus having success rate of nearly 90 india broke the world record by successfully placing 104 satellites almost tripling the russian record of 37 in earth orbit on 15 february 2017 on a single rocket launch pslv-c37 recent reports indicate that human spaceflight is planned with a spacecraft called gaganyaan for december 2021 on a home-grown gslv-iii rocket isro is also planning to send orbiters to venus mars and jupiter or comets and asteroids in the near future japan japan has been cooperating with the united states on missile defence since 1999 north korean nuclear and chinese military programs represent a serious issue for japans foreign relations japan is working on military and civilian space technologies developing missile defence systems new generations of military spy satellites and planning for manned stations on the moon japan started to construct spy satellites after north korea test fired a taepodong missile over japan in 1998 the north korean government claimed the missile was merely launching a satellite to space and accused japan of causing an arms race the japanese constitution adopted after world war ii limits military activities to defensive operations on may 2007 prime minister shinzo abe called for a bold review of the japanese constitution to allow the country to take a larger role in global security and foster a revival of national pride japan has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and does not have a program in place to develop one the japanese space shuttle hope-x to be launched by the conventional space launcher h-ii was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled then the simpler manned capsule fuji was proposed but not adopted pioneer projects of single-stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle horizontal takeoff and landing assts and vertical takeoff and landing kankoh-maru were developed but have not been adopted a more conservative new jaxa manned spacecraft project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the japanese plan to send manned missions to the moon shinya matsuura is doubtful about the japanese manned moon project and suspects the project is a euphemism for participation in the american constellation program jaxa planned to send a humanoid robot such as asimo to the moon other minor players iran iran has developed its own satellite launch vehicle named the safir slv based on the shahab series of irbms on 2 february 2009 iranian state television reported that irans first domestically made satellite omid from the persian meaning hope had been successfully launched into low earth orbit by a version of irans safir rocket the safir-2 the launch coincided with the 30th anniversary of the iranian revolution iran is also developing a new launch vehicle simorgh rocket israel israel became the tenth country in the world to build its own satellite and launch it with its own launcher on 19 september 1988 israel launched its first satellite ofeq-1 using an israeli-built shavit three-stage launch vehicle the launching was the high point of a process that began in 1983 with the establishment of the israel space agency under the aegis of the ministry of science space research by university-based scientists began in the 1960s providing a ready-made pool of experts for israels foray into space since then local universities research institutes and private industry backed by the israel space agency have made progress in space technology the agencys role is to support private and academic space projects coordinate their efforts initiate and develop international relations and projects head integrative projects involving different bodies and create public awareness for the importance of space development north korea north korea has many years of experience with rocket technology which it has passed along to pakistan and other countries on december 12 2012 north korea placed its first satellite in orbit with the launch of kwangmyngsng-3 unit 2 on 12 march 2009 north korea signed the outer space treaty and the registration convention after a previous declaration of preparations for the launch of kwangmyongsong-2 north korea twice announced satellite launches kwangmyngsng-1 on 31 august 1998 and kwangmyngsng-2 on 5 april 2009 neither of these claims were confirmed by the rest of the world but the united states and south korea believe there were tests of military ballistic missiles the north korean space agency is the korean committee of space technology which operates the musudan-ri and tongchang-dong space launch center rocket launching sites and has developed the baekdusan-1 and unha baekdusan-2 space launchers and kwangmyngsng satellites in 2009 north korea announced several future space projects including manned space flights and the development of a manned partially reusable launch vehicle the successor to the korean committee of space technology national aerospace development administration nada successfully launched an unha-3 launch vehicle in february of 2016 placing the kwangmyngsng-4 satellite in orbit south korea south korea is a newer player in the asian space race in august 2006 south korea launched its first military communications satellite the mugunghwa-5 the satellite was placed in geosynchronous orbit and collects surveillance information about north korea the south korean government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars in space technology and was due to launch its first space launcher the korea space launch vehicle in 2008 south koreas government justifies the cost for reasons of long-term commercial benefits and national pride south korea has long seen north koreas significantly longer missile range as a serious threat to its national security with the nations first astronaut launched into space lee so-yeon south korea gained confidence in entering the asian space race they have completed the construction of naro space center south korea is now attempting to build satellites and rockets with local technology south korea is pursuing a space program that could defend the peninsula while lessening their dependency on the united states pakistan pakistan started pursuing space technology on 16 september 1961 when pakistans space agency suparco was created with renowned physicist abdus salam as its first administrator in its early days suparco researched on the development of solid-fuel sounding rockets with assistance provided by the united states on 7 june 1962 with the launch of the rehbar-i lit teller of the way rocket pakistan became the tenth country in the world to successfully conduct the launch of an unmanned spacecraft this rocket had been developed by a team of scientists and engineers of the pakistan air force led by air commodore brigadier-general wadysaw jzef marian turowicz in collaboration with nasa and was launched from sonmiani pakistans first space launch facility suparcos unmanned space program continued till 1972 with nearly 20 successful launches suparcos unmanned space program suffered setbacks during the 1970s and the 1980s delaying the development and launch of pakistans first satellite badr-i till 1990 when it was launched from china suparco launched pakistans second satellite badr-b in 2001 from baikonur cosmodrome using a ukrainian zenit-2 rocket followed by paksat-1r in 2011 which was contracted and actually built and launched by china was pakistans first communication satellite on 9 july 2018 pakistan launched two satellites from chinas jiuquan satellite launch centre with long march 2c rocket the pakistan remote sensing satellite prss-1 was a dual-purpose earth observational and optical satellite it was designed and developed by suparcos engineers it was 1200 kilograms 2600lb weight satellite which will operate at an altitude of 640 kilometres 400mi with the launching of prss-1 pakistan has become one of the few countries to have its own remote sensing satellite in the orbit another flagship satellite pakistan technology evaluation satellite paktes-1a which was also designed and developed by suparcos engineers has also co-launched with prss-1 by the same launch rocket long march 2c it was a 285 kilograms 628lb weight satellite with an optical payload commensurate with national needs it will operate at an altitude of 610 kilometres 380mi pakistan intends to send its first national in space onboard a chinese spacecraft by 2022 as announced by information minister chaudhry bangladesh with the planned launched of bangabandhu-1 satellite purchased abroad bangladesh will operate its first communication satellite bangladesh space agency intends to launch satellites after 2020 bangladeshs government has stressed that the country seeks an entirely peaceful and commercial role in space other nations and regions indonesia operates their own communication satellites purchased abroad and intends to develop and use their own small space launch vehicle pengorbitan rps-420 other space players are malaysia and turkey that announced multi-task space programs in 2006 and 2007 they intend to develop their own satellites and launchers in the near future and manned space facilities as of 2012 turkey was developing its own military satellite the first gktrk satellite is planned to be launched in 2013 the turkish satellite is planned to be capable of taking satellite images of greater than two meters per pixel resolution thus making turkey the second nation in the

2011-2018 solar system exploration solar system exploration and manned spaceflights are major space technologies in the public eye since sakigake the first interplanetary probe in asia was launched in 1985 japan has completed the most planetary exploration but other nations are catching up moon race the moon is thought to be rich in helium-3 which could one day be used in nuclear fusion power plants to fuel future energy demands in asia all three main asian space powers plan to send men to the moon in the distant future and have already sent lunar probes probing the moon japan was the first asian country to launch a lunar probe the hiten japanese flying angel spacecraft known before the launch as muses-a built by the institute of space and astronautical science of japan was launched on 24 january 1990 in many ways the mission did not go as was planned kaguya the second japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft was launched on 14 september 2007 china launched its first lunar probe change-1 on 24 october 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 november 2007 india launched its first lunar probe chandrayaan-1 on 22 october 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 november 2008 the mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface moon landings the first confirmed moon landing from asia was hitens mission in 1993 an intentional hard landing at the end of the mission some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact hiten was not designed as a moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration the next japanese moon landing program was the lunar-a developed from 1992 although the lunar-a orbiter was cancelled its penetrators are integrated into the russian luna-glob program which was scheduled to launch in 2011 the penetrators are relatively hard landers but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact the first asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the indian moon impact probe mip released from chandrayaan-1 in 2008 mip was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes mip was designed to be destroyed at impact its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact the landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as chandrayaan-2 planned for 2019 the chinese change-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009 when china became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface one purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings a chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the change-3 mission exploration of the major planets japanese interplanetary probes have been mostly limited to small solar system bodies such as comets and asteroids jaxas nozomi probe was launched in 1998 but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet mars the second japanese probe for the planet venus akatsuki was launched in 2010 akatsuki entered orbit around venus on december 7 2015 chinese scientists expect that china will take 20years to launch independent planetary probes the chinese manned mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the chinese academy of sciences india has successfully launched mars orbiter mission on november 5 2013 it reached mars on september 2014 india has become the only country to successfully insert a satellite into martian orbit in its maiden attempt it also became the first asian country to achieve this feat asian space
