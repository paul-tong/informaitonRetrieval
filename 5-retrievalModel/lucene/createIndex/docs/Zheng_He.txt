zheng he chinese 13711433 or 1435 was a chinese mariner explorer diplomat fleet admiral and court eunuch during chinas early ming dynasty he was originally born as ma he in a muslim family later adopted the conferred surname zheng from emperor yongle zheng commanded expeditionary treasure voyages to southeast asia south asia western asia and east africa from 1405 to 1433 his larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length and carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks as a favorite of the yongle emperor whose usurpation he assisted zheng rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital nanjing the capital was later moved to beijing by the yongle emperor his voyages were long neglected in official chinese histories but have become well known in china and abroad since the publication of liang qichaos biography of our homelands great navigator zheng he in 1904 a trilingual stele left by the navigator was discovered on the island of ceylon shortly thereafter early life and family zheng he was born ma he to a muslim family of kunyang kunming yunnan china he had an older brother and four sisters ma hes religious beliefs became all-embracing and eclectic in his adulthood according to dreyer 2007 the liujiagang and changle inscriptions suggest that zheng hes devotion to tianfei the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers was the dominant faith to which he adhered reflecting the goddess central role to the treasure fleet john guy mentions when zheng he the muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the western ocean indian ocean in the early fifteenth century embarked on his voyages it was from the divine woman that he sought protection as well as at the tombs of the muslim saints on lingshan hill above the city of quanzhou zheng he was a great-great-great-grandson of sayyid ajjal shams al-din omar who served in the administration of the mongol empire and was the governor of yunnan during the early yuan dynasty his great-grandfather was named bayan and may have been stationed at a mongol garrison in yunnan zheng hes grandfather carried the title hajji while his father had the sinicized surname ma and also the title hajji which suggests that they had made the pilgrimage to mecca peterson 1994 suggests that the hajji of both his father and grandfather indicated that zheng he may have had mongol-arab ancestry and that he could speak arabic in the autumn of 1381 a ming army invaded and conquered yunnan which was then ruled by the mongol prince basalawarmi prince of liang in 1381 ma haji zheng hes father died in the fighting between the ming armies and mongol forces dreyer 2007 states that zheng hes father died at age 39 while resisting the ming conquest levathes 1996 states zheng hes father died at age 37 but it is unclear if he was helping the mongol army or just caught in the onslaught of battle wenming the oldest son buried their father outside of kunming in his capacity as admiral zheng he had an epitaph engraved in honor of his father composed by the minister of rites li zhigang on the duanwu festival of the 3rd year in the yongle era 1 june 1405 capture castration and service ma he was captured by the ming armies at yunnan in 1381 general fu youde saw ma he on a road and approached him in order to inquire about the location of the mongol pretender ma he responded defiantly by saying that the mongol pretender had jumped into a lake afterwards the general took him prisoner one source states that he was castrated at the age of 10 and then was placed in the service of the prince of yan while another source indicates that the castration occurred in 1385 ma he was sent to serve in the household of zhu di the prince of yan who later became the yongle emperor zhu di was eleven years older than ma while enslaved as a eunuch servant ma he eventually gained the confidence of zhu di while zhu di as his benefactor would gain the allegiance and loyalty of the young eunuch since 1380 the prince had been governing beiping later beijing which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile mongol tribes were situated ma would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier he often participated in zhu dis military campaigns against the mongols on 2 march 1390 ma accompanied the prince when he commanded his first expedition which was a great victory as the mongol commander naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception eventually he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince ma was also known as sn bo during the time of service in the household of the prince of yan this name was a reference to the three jewels triratna in buddhism there is also a document saying his name could be lit three protections also pronounced sn bo ma received a proper education while at beiping which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital nanjing as the hongwu emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate meanwhile the hongwu emperor purged and exterminated many of the original ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority especially those in the north like the prince of yan adulthood and military career ma hes appearance as an adult was recorded he was seven chi tall had a waist that was five chi in circumference cheeks and a forehead that was high a small nose glaring eyes teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells and a voice that was as loud as a bell it is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle the young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the jianwen emperors hostility to his uncles feudal bases prompted the 13991402 jingnan campaign which ended with the emperors apparent death and the ascension of the zhu di prince of yan as the yongle emperor in 1393 the crown prince had died thus the deceased princes son became the new heir apparent by the time the emperor died 24 june 1398 the prince of qin and the prince of jin had perished which left zhu di the prince of yan as the eldest surviving son of the emperor however zhu dis nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the jianwen emperor in 1398 he issued a policy known as xufn or reducing the feudatories which entails eliminating all the princes by stripping their power and military forces in august 1399 zhu di openly rebelled against his nephew in 1399 ma he successfully defended beipings city reservoir zhenglunba against the imperial armies in january 1402 zhu di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital nanjing zheng he would be one of his commanders during this campaign in 1402 zhu dis armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into nanjing on 13 july 1402 zhu di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later after ascending the throne as the yongle emperor zhu di promoted ma he as the grand director ti jin of the directorate of palace servants during the new years day on 11 february 1404 the yongle emperor conferred the surname zheng to ma he because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir zhenglunba against imperial forces in the siege of beiping of 1399 another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital nanjing it is believed that his choice to confer the surname zheng was because the eunuchs horse had been killed during the battle at zhenglunba near beiping at the onset of his rebellion in the new administration zheng he served in the highest posts as grand director and later as chief envoy zhngsh during his sea voyages over the next three decades he conducted seven of these voyages on behalf of the emperor trading and collecting tribute in the eastern pacific and indian oceans in 1424 admiral zheng he traveled to palembang in sumatra to confer an official seal and letter of appointment upon shi jisun who was placed in the office of pacification commissioner the taizong shilu 27 february 1424 entry reports that shi jisun had sent qiu yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father shi jinqing who was the pacification commissioner of palembang and was given permission from the yongle emperor on 7 september 1424 zhu gaozhi had inherited the throne as the hongxi emperor after the death of the yongle emperor on 12 august 1424 when zheng he returned from palembang he found that the yongle emperor had died during his absence after the ascension of zhu dis son as the hongxi emperor the ocean voyages were discontinued and zheng he was instead appointed as defender of nanjing the empires southern capital in that post he was largely responsible for the completion of the porcelain tower of nanjing an enormous pagoda still described as a wonder of the world as late as the 19th century on 15 may 1426 the xuande emperor ordered the directorate of ceremonial to send a letter to zheng he to reprimand him for a transgression earlier an official petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in nanjing the xuande emperor responded negatively to the official for placing the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves but he realized that zheng he and his associates had instigated the official dreyer 2007 noted that the nature of the emperors words indicated that zheng hes behaviour in this situation was the last straw but that there is too little information about what had transpired beforehand nevertheless the xuande emperor would eventually come to trust zheng he in 1430 the new xuande emperor appointed zheng he to command over a seventh and final expedition into the western ocean indian ocean in 1431 zheng he was bestowed with the title snbo ti jin using his informal name sanbao three treasures together with the title of grand director death one theory is that admiral zheng he died in 1433 it may have happened during or shortly after the seventh voyage another belief is that zheng he continued to serve as the defender of nanjing dying in 1435 a tomb was built for zheng he at the southern slope of cattle head hill nanjing the original tomb was a horseshoe-shaped grave it is a cenotaph believed to contain his clothes and headgear in 1985 the tomb was rebuilt following a muslim style he adopted the eldest son of his elder brother who was awarded a hereditary officer rank in the imperial guard expeditions the yuan dynasty and expanding sino-arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded chinese knowledge of the world universal maps previously only displaying china and its surrounding seas began to expand further and further into the southwest with much more accurate depictions of the extent of arabia and africa between 1405 and 1433 the ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions the yongle emperor disregarding the hongwu emperors expressed wishes designed them to establish a chinese presence and impose imperial control over the indian ocean trade impress foreign peoples in the indian ocean basin and extend the empires tributary system it has also been inferred from passages in the history of ming that the initial voyages were launched as part of the emperors attempt to capture his escaped predecessor which would have made the first voyage the largest-scale manhunt on water in the history of china zheng he was placed as the admiral in control of the huge fleet and armed forces that undertook these expeditions wang jinghong was appointed his second in command preparations were thorough and wide-ranging including the use of such numerous linguists that a foreign language institute was established at nanjing zheng hes first voyage departed 11 july 1405 from suzhou and consisted of a fleet of 317 ships holding almost 28000 crewmen zheng hes fleets visited brunei java thailand and southeast asia india the horn of africa and arabia dispensing and receiving goods along the way zheng he presented gifts of gold silver porcelain and silk in return china received such novelties as ostriches zebras camels and ivory from the swahili the giraffe he brought back from malindi was considered to be a qilin and taken as proof of the favor of heaven upon the administration while zheng hes fleet was unprecedented the routes were not zheng hes fleet was following long-established well-mapped routes of trade between china and the arabian peninsula employed since at least the han dynasty this fact along with the use of a more than abundant number of crew members that were regular military personnel leads some to speculate that these expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading chinas power through expansion during the three kingdoms period the king of wu sent a twenty year long diplomatic mission led by zhu ying and kang tai along the coast of asia which reached as far as the eastern roman empire after centuries of disruption the song dynasty restored large-scale maritime trade from china in the south pacific and indian oceans reaching as far as the arabian peninsula and east africa when his fleet first arrived in malacca there was already a sizable chinese community the general survey of the ocean shores yngy shngln composed by the translator ma huan in 1416 gave very detailed accounts of his observations of peoples customs and lives in the ports they visited he referred to the expatriate chinese as tang people tngrn zheng he generally sought to attain his goals through diplomacy and his large army awed most would-be enemies into submission but a contemporary reported that zheng he walked like a tiger and did not shrink from violence when he considered it necessary to impress foreign peoples with chinas military might he ruthlessly suppressed pirates who had long plagued chinese and southeast asian waters for example he defeated chen zuyi one of the most feared and respected pirate captains and returned him to china for execution he also waged a land war against the kingdom of kotte on ceylon and he made displays of military force when local officials threatened his fleet in arabia and east africa from his fourth voyage he brought envoys from thirty states who traveled to china and paid their respects at the ming court in 1424 the yongle emperor died his successor the hongxi emperor r 14241425 stopped the voyages during his short reign zheng he made one more voyage during the reign of hongxis son the xuande emperor r 14261435 but after that the voyages of the chinese treasure ship fleets were ended xuande believed his fathers decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfathers sending zheng he to the western ocean the voyages were contrary to the rules stipulated in the huang ming zuxun the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the hongwu emperor some far-off countries pay their tribute to me at much expense and through great difficulties all of which are by no means my own wish messages should be forwarded to them to reduce their tribute so as to avoid high and unnecessary expenses on both sides they further violated longstanding confucian principles they were only made possible by and therefore continued to represent a triumph of the mings eunuch faction over the administrations scholar-bureaucrats upon zheng hes death and his factions fall from power his successors sought to minimize him in official accounts along with continuing attempts to destroy all records related to the jianwen emperor or the manhunt to find him although unmentioned in the official dynastic histories zheng he probably died during the treasure fleets last voyage although he has a tomb in china it is empty he was buried at sea zheng he led seven expeditions to the western or indian ocean zheng he brought back to china many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms including king vira alakeshwara of ceylon who came to china as a captive to apologize to the emperor for offenses against his mission zheng himself wrote of his travels we have traversed more than 100000 li of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors while our sails loftily unfurled like clouds day and night continued their course as rapidly as a star traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare sailing charts zheng hes sailing charts the mao kun map were published in a book entitled the wubei zhi a treatise on armament technology written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to zheng hes and earlier voyages it was originally a strip map 205cm by 560cm that could be rolled up but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 milesinch in the nanjing area to 215 milesinch in parts of the african coast investigation into folios 19v to 20r of the mao kun map which covers the indian ocean including south india sri lanka the maldives and east africa suggests that it is a composite of four maps one for sri lanka one for south india one for the maldives and one for around 400km of the east african coast no further south than 6 degrees south of the equator each of these maps is positioned at a different orientation to fit with the ocean currents and winds required of a sailing chart rather than a formal map the analysis also suggests that arabic-speaking pilots with a detailed knowledge of the african coast were involved in the cartography there is little attempt to provide an accurate 2-d representation instead the sailing instructions are given using a 24-point compass system with a chinese symbol for each point together with a sailing time or distance which takes account of the local currents and winds sometimes depth soundings are also provided it also shows bays estuaries capes and islands ports and mountains along the coast important landmarks such as pagodas and temples and shoal rocks of 300 named places outside china more than 80 can be confidently located there are also fifty observations of stellar altitude size of the ships traditional and popular accounts of zheng hes voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships far larger than any other wooden ships in history chinese records state that zheng hes fleet sailed as far as east africa according to medieval chinese sources zheng he commanded seven expeditions the 1405 expedition consisted of 27800 men and a fleet of 62 treasure ships supported by approximately 190 smaller ships the fleet included chinese treasure ships bo chun used by the commander of the fleet and his deputies nine-masted about 127 metres 417 feet long and 52 metres 171 feet wide according to later writers equine ships m chun carrying horses and tribute goods and repair material for the fleet eight-masted about 103m 338ft long and 42m 138ft wide supply ships ling chun containing staple for the crew seven-masted about 78m 256ft long and 35m 115ft wide troop transports bng chun six-masted about 67m 220ft long and 25m 82ft wide fuchuan warships f chun five-masted about 50m 160ft long patrol boats zu chun eight-oared about 37m 121ft long water tankers shu chun with 1 months supply of fresh water six more expeditions took place from 1407 to 1433 with fleets of comparable size if the accounts can be taken as factual zheng hes treasure ships were mammoth ships with nine masts four decks and were capable of accommodating more than 500 passengers as well as a massive amount of cargo marco polo and ibn battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1000 passengers in their translated accounts niccol da conti a contemporary of zheng he was also an eyewitness of ships in southeast asia claiming to have seen 5 masted junks weighing about 2000 tons there are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as 600 feet on the ships were navigators explorers sailors doctors workers and soldiers along with the translator and diarist gong zhen the largest ships in the fleet the chinese treasure ships described in chinese chronicles would have been several times larger than any other wooden ship ever recorded in history surpassing lorient 65 metres 2133ft long which was built in the late 18th century the first ships to attain 126m 4134ft long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls some scholars argue that it is highly unlikely that zheng hes ship was 450 feet 1372m in length some estimating that they were 390408 feet 11891244m long and 160166 feet 488506m wide instead while others put them as small as 200250 feet 610762m in length which would make them smaller than the equine supply and troop ships in the fleet one explanation for the seemingly inefficient size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 zhang treasure ships were merely used by the emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the yangtze for court business including reviewing zheng hes expedition fleet the yangtze river with its calmer waters may have been navigable by these treasure ships zheng he a court eunuch would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships seaworthy or not the main ships of zheng hes fleet were instead 6 masted 2000-liao ships this would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons legacy imperial china in the decades after the last voyage imperial officials minimized the importance of zheng he and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled the information in the yongle and xuande emperors official annals was incomplete and even erroneous other official publications omitted them completely although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions unauthorized by and in fact counter to the injunctions of the dynastic founder presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty state-sponsored ming naval efforts declined dramatically after zhengs voyages starting in the early 15th century china experienced increasing pressure from the surviving yuan mongols from the north the relocation of the capital north to beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically at considerable expense china launched annual military expeditions from beijing to weaken the mongolians the expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions further in 1449 mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the zhengtong emperor at tumu fortress less than a days march from the walls of the capital the mongolians wiped out the chinese army and captured the emperor this battle had two salient effects first it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads second the mongols caused a political crisis in china when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new jingtai era not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return upon his return to power china abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the great wall of china in this environment funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen however missions from southeast asia continued to arrive for decades depending on local conditions they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them the history of ming records imperial edicts forbidding java champa and siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years southeast asia veneration of zheng he among the chinese diaspora in southeast asia zheng he became a figure of folk veneration even some of his crew members who happened to stay in this or that port sometimes did as well such as poontaokong on sulu the temples of this cult called after either of his names cheng hoon or sam po are peculiar to overseas chinese except for a single temple in hongjian originally constructed by a returned filipino chinese in the ming dynasty and rebuilt by another filipino chinese after the original was destroyed during the cultural revolution the same village of hongjian in fujians jiaomei township is also the ancestral home of corazon aquino malacca the oldest and most important chinese temple in malacca is the 17th-century cheng hoon teng dedicated to guanyin during dutch colonial rule the head of the cheng hoon temple was appointed chief over the communitys chinese inhabitants following zheng hes arrival the sultan and sultana of malacca visited china at the head of over 540 of their subjects bearing ample tribute sultan mansur shah r 14591477 later dispatched tun perpatih putih as his envoy to china carrying a letter from the sultan to the ming emperor the letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage malay but not chinese annals record that in the year 1459 a princess named hang li po or hang liu was sent from china to marry the sultan the princess came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage they eventually settled in bukit cina it is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace creating the descendants now known as the peranakan owing to this supposed lineage the peranakan still use special honorifics baba for the men and nyonya for the women indonesia indonesian chinese have established temples to zheng he in jakarta cirebon surabaya and semarang in 1961 the indonesian islamic leader and scholar hamka credited zheng he with an important role in the development of islam in indonesia the brunei times credits zheng he with building chinese muslim communities in palembang and along the shores of java the malay peninsula and the philippines these muslims allegedly followed the hanafi school in the chinese language this chinese muslim community was led by hajji yan ying yu who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names the chinese trader sun long even supposedly adopted the son of the king of majapahit and his chinese wife a son who went on to become raden patah amid this assimilation and loss of contact with china itself the hanafi islam became absorbed by the local shafii school and the presence of distinctly ethnic chinese muslims dwindled to almost nothing the malay annals also record a number of hanafi mosques in semarang and ancol for instance were converted directly into temples of the zheng he cult during the 1460s and 70s the sam poo kong temple in semarang was built to commemorate zheng hes voyage to java modern scholarship in the 1950s historians such as john fairbank and joseph needham popularized the idea that after zheng hes voyages china turned away from the seas due to the haijin edict and was isolated from european technological advancements modern historians point out that chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after zheng he that chinese ships continued to participate in southeast asian commerce until the 19th century and that active chinese trading with india and east africa continued long after the time of zheng moreover revisionist historians such as jack goldstone argue that the zheng he voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of china although the ming dynasty did ban shipping with the haijin edict this was a policy of the hongwu emperor that long preceded zheng he and the ban so obviously disregarded by the yongle emperor was eventually lifted entirely however the ban on maritime shipping did force countless numbers of people into smuggling and piracy neglect of the imperial navy and nanjing dockyards after zheng hes voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to japanese wokou during the 16th century richard von glahn a ucla professor of chinese history commented that most treatments of zheng he present him wrongly they offer counterfactual arguments and emphasize chinas missed opportunity this narrative emphasizes the failure instead of the accomplishments despite his assertion that zheng he reshaped asia glahn argues that maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the zheng he story and the effects of his voyages cultural influence despite the official neglect the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some chinese and novelizations of the voyages occurred such as the romance of the three-jeweled eunuch in 1597 on his travels zheng he built mosques while also spreading the worship of mazu he apparently never found time for a pilgrimage to mecca but did send sailors there on his last voyage he played an important part in developing relations between china and islamic countries zheng he also visited muslim shrines of islamic holy men in the fujian in modern times interest in
