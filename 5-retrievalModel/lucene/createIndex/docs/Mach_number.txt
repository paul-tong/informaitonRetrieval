in fluid dynamics the mach number m or ma mk german max is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound where by definition at mach1 the local flow velocity u is equal to the speed of sound at mach065 u is 65 of the speed of sound subsonic and at mach135 u is 35 faster than the speed of sound supersonic the local speed of sound and thereby the mach number depends on the condition of the surrounding medium in particular the temperature the mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an incompressible flow the medium can be a gas or a liquid the boundary can be traveling in the medium or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it or they can both be moving with different velocities what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other the boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium or of a channel such as a nozzle diffusers or wind tunnels channeling the medium as the mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds it is a dimensionless number if m0203 and the flow is quasi-steady and isothermal compressibility effects will be small and simplified incompressible flow equations can be used the mach number is named after austrian physicist and philosopher ernst mach and is a designation proposed by aeronautical engineer jakob ackeret as the mach number is a dimensionless quantity rather than a unit of measure with mach the number comes after the unit the second mach number is mach2 instead of 2mach or machs this is somewhat reminiscent of the early modern ocean sounding unit mark a synonym for fathom which was also unit-first and may have influenced the use of the term mach in the decade preceding faster-than-sound human flight aeronautical engineers referred to the speed of sound as machs number never mach 1 overview mach number is useful because the fluid behaves in a similar manner at a given mach number regardless of other variables as modeled in the international standard atmosphere dry air at mean sea level standard temperature of 15c 59f the speed of sound is 3403 meters per second 11165fts the speed of sound is not a constant in a gas it increases as the absolute temperature increases and since atmospheric temperature generally decreases with increasing altitude between sea level and 11000 meters 36089ft the speed of sound also decreases for example the standard atmosphere model lapses temperature to 565c 697f at 11000 meters 36089ft altitude with a corresponding speed of sound mach1 of 2950 meters per second 9678fts 867 of the sea level value classification of mach regimes while the terms subsonic and supersonic in the purest sense refer to speeds below and above the local speed of sound respectively aerodynamicists often use the same terms to talk about particular ranges of mach values this occurs because of the presence of a transonic regime around m 1 where approximations of the navier-stokes equations used for subsonic design no longer apply the simplest explanation is that the flow locally begins to exceed m 1 even though the freestream mach number is below this value meanwhile the supersonic regime is usually used to talk about the set of mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used where for example the air flow is not chemically reacting and where heat-transfer between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations in the following table the regimes or ranges of mach values are referred to and not the pure meanings of the words subsonic and supersonic generally nasa defines high hypersonic as any mach number from 10 to 25 and re-entry speeds as anything greater than mach 25 aircraft operating in this regime include the space shuttle and various space planes in development high-speed flow around objects flight can be roughly classified in six categories for comparison the required speed for low earth orbit is approximately 75kms mach 254 in air at high altitudes at transonic speeds the flow field around the object includes both sub- and supersonic parts the transonic period begins when first zones of m 1 flow appear around the object in case of an airfoil such as an aircrafts wing this typically happens above the wing supersonic flow can decelerate back to subsonic only in a normal shock this typically happens before the trailing edge fig1a as the speed increases the zone of m 1 flow increases towards both leading and trailing edges as m 1 is reached and passed the normal shock reaches the trailing edge and becomes a weak oblique shock the flow decelerates over the shock but remains supersonic a normal shock is created ahead of the object and the only subsonic zone in the flow field is a small area around the objects leading edge fig1b fig 1 mach number in transonic airflow around an airfoil m 1 a and m 1 b when an aircraft exceeds mach 1 ie the sound barrier a large pressure difference is created just in front of the aircraft this abrupt pressure difference called a shock wave spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape a so-called mach cone it is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead a person inside the aircraft will not hear this the higher the speed the more narrow the cone at just over m 1 it is hardly a cone at all but closer to a slightly concave plane at fully supersonic speed the shock wave starts to take its cone shape and flow is either completely supersonic or in case of a blunt object only a very small subsonic flow area remains between the objects nose and the shock wave it creates ahead of itself in the case of a sharp object there is no air between the nose and the shock wave the shock wave starts from the nose as the mach number increases so does the strength of the shock wave and the mach cone becomes increasingly narrow as the fluid flow crosses the shock wave its speed is reduced and temperature pressure and density increase the stronger the shock the greater the changes at high enough mach numbers the temperature increases so much over the shock that ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin such flows are called hypersonic it is clear that any object traveling at hypersonic speeds will likewise be exposed to the same extreme temperatures as the gas behind the nose shock wave and hence choice of heat-resistant materials becomes important high-speed flow in a channel as a flow in a channel becomes supersonic one significant change takes place the conservation of mass flow rate leads one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed ie making the channel narrower results in faster air flow and at subsonic speeds this holds true however once the flow becomes supersonic the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed expanding the channel actually increases the speed the obvious result is that in order to accelerate a flow to supersonic one needs a convergent-divergent nozzle where the converging section accelerates the flow to sonic speeds and the diverging section continues the acceleration such nozzles are called de laval nozzles and in extreme cases they are able to reach hypersonic speeds mach13 15926kmh 9896mph at 20c an aircraft machmeter or electronic flight information system efis can display mach number derived from stagnation pressure pitot tube and static pressure calculation the mach number at which an aircraft is flying can be calculated by where note that the dynamic pressure can be found as assuming air to be an ideal gas the formula to compute mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is derived from bernoullis equation for m 1 where the formula to compute mach number in a supersonic compressible flow is derived from the rayleigh supersonic pitot equation calculating mach number from pitot tube pressure mach number is a function of temperature and true airspeed aircraft flight instruments however operate using pressure differential to compute mach number not temperature assuming air to be an ideal gas the formula to compute mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is found from bernoullis equation for m 1 above the formula to compute mach number in a supersonic compressible flow can be found from the rayleigh supersonic pitot equation above using parameters for air where as can be seen m appears on both sides of the equation and for practical purposes a root-finding algorithm must be used for a numerical solution the equation is equivalent to a 39th-order polynomial in m and by the abel-ruffini theorem it is not possible to determine m in closed form it is first determined whether m is indeed greater than 10 by calculating m from the subsonic equation if m is greater than 10 at that point then the value of m from the subsonic equation is used as the initial condition for fixed point iteration of the supersonic equation which usually converges in just a few iterations alternatively newtons method can also be used see also critical mach number
