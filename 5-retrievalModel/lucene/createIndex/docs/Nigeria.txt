the country this name was coined in the late 19th century by british journalist flora shaw who later married lord lugard a british colonial administrator the origin of the name niger which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the niger river is uncertain the word is likely an alteration of the tuareg name egerew n-igerewen used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around timbuktu prior to 19th-century european colonialism history early 500 bc 1500 the nok civilisation of northern nigeria flourished between 500 bc and ad 200 producing life-sized terracotta figures that are some of the earliest known sculptures in sub-saharan africa further north the cities kano and katsina have a recorded history dating to around 999 ad hausa kingdoms and the kanembornu empire prospered as trade posts between north and west africa the kingdom of nri of the igbo people consolidated in the 10th century and continued until it lost its sovereignty to the british in 1911 nri was ruled by the eze nri and the city of nri is considered to be the foundation of igbo culture nri and aguleri where the igbo creation myth originates are in the territory of the umeuri clan members of the clan trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure eri in west africa the oldest bronzes made using the lost-wax process were from igbo-ukwu a city under nri influence the

century and its material culture includes terracotta and bronze figures middle ages 15001800 oyo at its territorial zenith in the late 17th to early 18th centuries extended its influence from western nigeria to modern-day togo the edos benin empire is located in southwestern nigeria benins power lasted between the 15th and 19th centuries their dominance reached as far as the city of eko an edo name later changed to lagos by the portuguese and further at the beginning of the 19th century usman dan fodio directed a successful jihad and created and led the centralised fulani empire also known as the sokoto caliphate the territory controlled by the resultant state included much of modern-day northern and central nigeria it lasted until the 1903 break-up of the empire into various european colonies for centuries various peoples in modern-day nigeria traded overland with traders from north africa cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western central and northern africa in the 16th century spanish and portuguese explorers were the first europeans to begin significant direct trade with peoples of modern-day nigeria at the port they named lagos and in calabar europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast coastal trade with europeans also marked the beginnings of the atlantic slave trade the port of calabar on the historical bight of biafra now commonly referred to as the bight of bonny became one of the largest slave trading posts in west africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade other major slaving ports in nigeria were located in badagry lagos on the bight of benin and on bonny island on the bight of biafra the majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors territory as forced labour after time they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors society a number of slave routes were established throughout nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports some of the more prolific slave traders were linked with the oyo empire in the southwest the aro confederacy in the southeast and the sokoto caliphate in the north slavery also existed in the territories comprising modern-day nigeria its scope was broadest towards the end of the 19th century according to the encyclopedia of african history it is estimated that by the 1890s the largest slave population of the world about 2 million people was concentrated in the territories of the sokoto caliphate the use of slave labor was extensive especially in agriculture a changing legal imperative transatlantic slave trade outlawed by britain in 1807 and economic imperative a desire for political and social stability led most european powers to support widespread cultivation of agricultural products such as the palm for use in european industry british nigeria 18001960 the slave trade was engaged in by european state and non-state actors such as great britain the netherlands portugal and private companies as well as various african states and non-state actors with rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities great britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807 following the napoleonic wars great britain established the west africa squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves it stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the african coast with slaves the seized slaves were taken to freetown a colony in west africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from britain britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851 deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko helping to install the amenable oba akitoye and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos on 1 january 1852 britain annexed lagos as a crown colony in august 1861 with the lagos treaty of cession british missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland in 1864 samuel ajayi crowther became the first african bishop of the anglican church in 1885 british claims to a west african sphere of influence received recognition from other european nations at the berlin conference the following year it chartered the royal niger company under the leadership of sir george taubman goldie in 1900 the companys territory came under the control of the british government which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern nigeria on 1 january 1901 nigeria became a british protectorate and part of the british empire the foremost world power at the time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the british empires efforts to expand its territory by war the british conquered benin in 1897 and in the anglo-aro war 19011902 defeated other opponents the restraint or conquest of these states opened up the niger area to british rule in 1914 the british formally united the niger area as the colony and protectorate of nigeria administratively nigeria remained divided into the northern and southern protectorates and lagos colony inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction economic and cultural with the british and other europeans owing to the coastal economy christian missions established western educational institutions in the protectorates under britains policy of indirect rule and validation of islamic tradition the crown did not encourage the operation of christian missions in the northern islamic part of the country some children of the southern elite went to great britain to pursue higher education by independence in 1960 regional differences in modern educational access were marked the legacy though less pronounced continues to the present day imbalances between north and south were expressed in nigerias political life as well for instance northern nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst in other parts of nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism following world war ii in response to the growth of nigerian nationalism and demands for independence successive constitutions legislated by the british government moved nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis by the middle of the 20th century a great wave for independence was sweeping across africa nigeria achieved independence in 1960 independent federation and first republic 19601966 the federation of nigeria gained independence from the united kingdom on 1 october 1960 while retaining the british monarch elizabeth ii as nominal head of state and queen of nigeria nigerias government was a coalition of conservative parties the nigerian peoples congress npc a party dominated by northerners and those of the islamic faith and the igbo and christian-dominated national council of nigeria and the cameroons ncnc led by nnamdi azikiwe azikiwe replaced the colonial governor-general in november 1960 the opposition comprised the comparatively liberal action group ag which was largely dominated by the yoruba and led by obafemi awolowo the cultural and political differences between nigerias dominant ethnic groups the hausa northerners igbo easterners and yoruba westerners were sharp an imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite southern cameroons opted to join the republic of cameroon while northern cameroons chose to remain in nigeria the northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part in 1963 the nation established a federal republic with azikiwe as its first president when elections were held in 1965 the nigerian national democratic party came to power in nigerias western region civil war 19671970 the disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to back-to-back military coups the first coup was in january 1966 and was led mostly by igbo soldiers under majors emmanuel ifeajuna and chukwuma kaduna nzeogwu the coup plotters succeeded in assassinating prime minister abubakar tafawa balewa premier ahmadu bello of the northern region and premier ladoke akintola of the western region but the coup plotters struggled to form a central government president nwafor orizu handed over government control to the army then under the command of another igbo officer general jtu aguiyi-ironsi later the counter-coup of 1966 supported primarily by northern military officers facilitated the rise of lt colonel yakubu gowon to head of state tension rose between north and south igbos in northern cities suffered persecution and many fled to the eastern region in may 1967 the eastern region declared independence as a state called the republic of biafra under the leadership of lt colonel emeka ojukwu the nigerian civil war began as the official nigerian government side attacked biafra on 6 july 1967 at garkem the 30-month war with a long siege of biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies ended in january 1970 estimates of the number of dead in the former eastern region are between 1 and 3 million people from warfare disease and starvation during the 30-month civil war france egypt the soviet union britain israel and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes britain and the soviet union were the main military backers of the nigerian government while france and others aided the biafrans nigeria used egyptian pilots for their air force military juntas 19701999 during the oil boom of the 1970s nigeria joined opec and the huge oil revenues it was generating enriched the economy despite these revenues the military government did little to improve the standard of living of the population help small and medium businesses or invest in infrastructure as oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country as oil production and revenue rose the nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns it did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability that spelled doom to federalism in nigeria beginning in 1979 nigerians participated in a return to democracy when olusegun obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of shehu shagari the shagari government became viewed as corrupt by virtually all sectors of nigerian society in 1983 the inspectors of the state-owned nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc began to notice the slow poisoning of the waters of this country the military coup of muhammadu buhari shortly after the regimes re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development buhari promised major reforms but his government fared little better than its predecessor his regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985 the new head of state ibrahim babangida declared himself president and commander in chief of the armed forces and of the ruling supreme military council he set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance babangidas tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity he instituted the international monetary funds structural adjustment program sap to aid in the repayment of the countrys crushing international debt at the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt he enrolled nigeria in the organization of the islamic conference which aggravated religious tensions in the country babangida survived an abortive coup then postponed a promised return to democracy to 1992 free and fair elections were finally held on 12 june 1993 the first since the military coup of 1983 with a presidential victory for moshood kashimawo olawale abiola of the social democratic party who gained some 58 of the votes defeating bashir tofa of the national republican convention however babangida annulled the elections leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government but not before appointing ernest shonekan head of an interim government babangidas regime has been considered the most corrupt and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in nigeria in late 1993 shonekans caretaker regime was overwhelmed by the military coup of general sani abacha who used military force on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest he shifted money to offshore accounts in western european banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals in 1995 the government hanged environmentalist ken saro-wiwa on trumped-up charges in the deaths of four ogoni elders lawsuits under the american alien tort statute against royal dutch shell and brian anderson the head of shells nigerian operation settled out of court with shell continuing to deny liability several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to abacha were discovered in 1999 the regime came to an end in 1998 when the dictator died in the villa his successor general abdulsalami abubakar adopted a new constitution on 5 may 1999 which provided for multiparty elections on 29 may 1999 abubakar transferred power to the winner of the elections obasanjo who had since retired from the military democratisation 1999 nigeria regained democracy in 1999 when it elected olusegun obasanjo the former military head of state as the new president of nigeria this ended almost 33 years of military rule from 1966 until 1999 excluding the short-lived second republic between 1979 and 1983 by military dictators who seized power in coups dtat and counter-coups during the nigerian military juntas of 19661979 and 19831998 although the elections that brought obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development ethnic violence for control over the oil-producing niger delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the issues in the country umaru yaradua of the peoples democratic party pdp came into power in the general election of 2007 the international community has been observing nigerian elections to encourage a free and fair process and condemned this one as being severely flawed yaradua died on 5 may 2010 dr goodluck jonathan was sworn in as yaraduas replacement on 6 may 2010 becoming nigerias 14th head of state while his vice-president namadi sambo an architect and former kaduna state governor was chosen on 18 may 2010 by the national assembly his confirmation followed president jonathans nomination of sambo to that position goodluck jonathan served as nigerias president until 16 april 2011 when a new presidential election in nigeria was conducted jonathan of the pdp was declared the winner on 19 april 2011 having won the election with a total of 22495187 of the 39469484 votes cast to stand ahead of muhammadu buhari from the main opposition party the congress for progressive change cpc which won 12214853 of the total votes cast the international media reported the elections as having run smoothly with relatively little violence or voter fraud in contrast to previous elections in the march 2015 election muhammadu buhari defeated goodluck jonathan by roughly 2 million votes observers generally praised the election as being fair jonathan was generally praised for conceding defeat and limiting the risk of unrest government and politics nigeria is a federal republic modelled after the united states with executive power exercised by the president it is influenced by the westminster system model in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature the president presides as both head of state and head of the federal government the leader is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two 4-year terms in 28 march 2015 presidential election general muhammadu buhari emerged victorious to become the president of the federal republic of nigeria defeating then-incumbent dr goodluck jonathan the presidents power is checked by a senate and a house of representatives which are combined in a bicameral body called the national assembly the senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of abuja members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms the house contains 360 seats with the number of seats per state is determined by population ethnocentrism tribalism religious persecution and prebendalism have affected nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960 kin-selective altruism has made its way into nigerian politics resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate federal power to a particular region of their interests nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as massob nationalist movements such as oodua peoples congress movement for the emancipation of the niger delta and a civil war nigerias three largest ethnic groups hausa igbo and yoruba have maintained historical preeminence in nigerian politics competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft because of the above issues nigerias political parties are pan-national and secular in character though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities the two major political parties are the peoples democratic party of nigeria and the all progressives congress about twenty minor opposition parties are registered the then-president olusegun obasanjo acknowledged fraud and other electoral lapses but said the result reflected opinion polls in a national television address in 2007 he added that if nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years in the nigerian general election 2015 the victorious all progressives congress has 225 house seats and 60 in the senate while the defeated peoples democratic party of nigeria became the opposition with 125 seats in the house and 49 in the senate as in many other african societies prebendalism and high rates of corruption continue to constitute major challenges to nigeria all major parties have practised vote-rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive in 1983 the policy institute at kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote-rigging in 2012 nigeria was estimated to have lost over 400 billion to corruption since independence law there are three distinct systems of law in nigeria common law derived from its british colonial past and a development of its own after independence customary law derived from indigenous traditional norms and practice including the dispute resolution meetings of pre-colonial yorubaland secret societies and the kp and kk of igboland and ibibioland sharia law used only in the predominantly muslim northern states of the country it is an islamic legal system that had been used long before the colonial administration in late 1999 zamfara emphasised its use with eleven other northern states following suit these states are kano katsina niger bauchi borno kaduna gombe sokoto jigawa yobe and kebbi the country has a judicial branch the highest court of which is the supreme court of nigeria foreign relations upon gaining independence in 1960 nigeria made african unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in south africa one notable exception to the african focus was nigerias close relationship developed with israel throughout the 1960s the latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of nigerias parliament buildings nigerias foreign policy was tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war it supported movements against white minority governments in the southern africa sub-region nigeria backed the african national congress anc by taking a committed tough line with regard to the south african government and their military actions in southern africa nigeria was also a founding member of the organisation for african unity now the african union and has tremendous influence in west africa and africa on the whole nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in west africa functioning as standard-bearer for the economic community of west african states ecowas and ecomog economic and military organizations respectively with this africa-centred stance nigeria readily sent troops to the congo at the behest of the united nations shortly after independence and has maintained membership since that time nigeria also supported several pan-african and pro-self government causes in the 1970s including garnering support for angolas mpla swapo in namibia and aiding opposition to the minority governments of portuguese mozambique and rhodesia nigeria retains membership in the non-aligned movement in late november 2006 it organised an africa-south america summit in abuja to promote what some attendees termed south-south linkages on a variety of fronts nigeria is also a member of the international criminal court and the commonwealth of nations it was temporarily expelled from the latter in 1995 when ruled by the abacha regime nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s and maintains membership in organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which it joined in july 1971 its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes volatile international relations with both developed countries notably the united states and the developing countries of china jamaica and ghana and kenya in africa millions of nigerians have emigrated during times of economic hardship primarily to europe north america and australia it is estimated that over a million nigerians have emigrated to the united states and constitute the nigerian american populace individuals in many such diasporic communities have joined the egbe omo yoruba society a national association of yoruba descendants in north america military the nigerian military are charged with protecting the federal republic of nigeria promoting nigerias global security interests and supporting peacekeeping efforts especially in west africa this is in support of the doctrine sometimes called pax nigeriana the nigerian military consist of an army a navy and an air force the military in nigeria have played a major role in the countrys history since independence various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history its last period of military rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator sani abacha in 1998 his successor abdulsalam abubakar handed over power to the democratically-elected government of olusegun obasanjo the next year as africas most populated country nigeria has repositioned its military as a peacekeeping force on the continent since 1995 the nigerian military through ecomog mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in liberia 1997 ivory coast 19971999 and sierra leone 19971999 under an african union mandate it has stationed forces in sudans darfur region to try to

nigeria is chappal waddi at 2419m 7936ft the main rivers are the niger and the benue which converge and empty into the niger delta this is one of the worlds largest river deltas and the location of a large area of central african mangroves nigeria has a varied landscape the far south is defined by its tropical rainforest climate where annual rainfall is 60 to 80 inches 1500 to 2000mm a year in the southeast stands the obudu plateau coastal plains are found in both the southwest and the southeast this forest zones most southerly portion is defined as salt water swamp also known as a mangrove swamp because of the large amount of mangroves in the area north of this is fresh water swamp containing different vegetation from the salt water swamp and north of that is rainforest nigerias most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the niger and benue river valleys which merge into each other and form a y shape to the southwest of the niger is rugged highland to the southeast of the benue are hills and mountains which form the mambilla plateau the highest plateau in nigeria this plateau extends through the border with cameroon where the montane land is part of the bamenda highlands of cameroon the area near the border with cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the cross-sanaga-bioko coastal forests ecoregion an important centre for biodiversity it is habitat for the drill monkey which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in cameroon the areas surrounding calabar cross river state also in this forest are believed to contain the worlds largest diversity of butterflies the area of southern nigeria between the niger and the cross rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population with it being replaced by grassland see cross-niger transition forests everything in between the far south and the far north is savannah insignificant tree cover with grasses and flowers located between trees rainfall is more limited to between 500 and 1500 millimetres 20 and 60in per year the savannah zones three categories are guinean forest-savanna mosaic sudan savannah and sahel savannah guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand found in the northeast in the sahel region rain is less than 500 millimetres 20in per year and the sahara desert is encroaching in the dry northeast corner of the country lies lake chad which nigeria shares with niger chad and cameroon environmental issues nigerias delta region home of the large oil industry experiences serious oil spills and other environmental problems which has caused conflict waste management including sewage treatment the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problems in nigeria waste management presents problems in a mega city like lagos and other major nigerian cities which are linked with economic development population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste this huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of kubwa community in the federal capital territory where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste dumping of waste along or into the canals sewerage systems that are channels for water flows and the like haphazard industrial planning increased urbanisation poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major cities of the country some of the solutions have been disastrous to the environment resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater in 2005 nigeria had the highest rate of deforestation in the world according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao that year 122 the equivalent of 11089000 hectares had been forested in the country between 1990 and 2000 nigeria lost an average of 409700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 24 between 1990 and 2005 in total nigeria lost 357 of its forest cover or around 6145000 hectares in 2010 thousands of people were inadvertently exposed to lead-containing soil ore from informal gold mining within the northern state of zamfara while estimates vary it is thought that upwards of 400 children died of acute lead poisoning making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality epidemic ever encountered as of 2016 efforts to manage the exposure are ongoing administrative divisions nigeria is divided into thirty-six states and one federal capital territory which are further sub-divided into 774 local government areas lgas in some contexts the states are aggregated into six geopolitical zones north west north east north central south east south south and south west as of the 2006 census nigeria has eight cities with a population of over

growth in the world in 20102050 nigeria is one of two countries from africa among 11 global growth generators countries previously economic development had been hindered by years of military rule corruption and mismanagement the restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential as of 2014 it is the largest economy in africa having overtaken south africa during the oil boom of the 1970s nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments with the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal which increased the size of the debt after negotiations by the nigeria authorities in october 2005 nigeria and its paris club creditors reached an agreement under which nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60 nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40 freeing up at least 115billion annually for poverty reduction programmes nigeria made history in april 2006 by becoming the first african country to completely pay off its debt estimated 30billion owed to the paris club nigeria is trying to reach the first of the sustainable development goals which is to end poverty in all its forms by 2030 agriculture as of 2010 about 30 of nigerians are employed in agriculture agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of nigeria major crops include beans sesame cashew nuts cassava cocoa beans groundnuts gum arabic kolanut maize corn melon millet palm kernels palm oil plantains rice rubber sorghum soybeans and yams cocoa is the leading non-oil foreign exchange earner rubber is the second-largest non-oil foreign exchange earner prior to the nigerian civil war nigeria was self-sufficient in food agriculture has failed to keep pace with nigerias rapid population growth and nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself the nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s oil and natural gas nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter and has the 10th largest proven reserves the country joined opec in 1971 petroleum plays a large role in the nigerian economy accounting for 40 of gdp and 80 of government earnings however agitation for better resource control in

nigeria immigrants also include those from other west african or east african nations these minorities mostly reside in major cities such as lagos and abuja or in the niger delta as employees for the

have been spoken in nigeria nine of them are now extinct in some areas of nigeria ethnic groups speak more than one language the official language of nigeria english was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country owing to the influence of british colonisation that ended in 1960 many french speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the english spoken in the border regions of nigeria and some nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in french to work in the surrounding countries the french spoken in nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the french spoken in benin french may also be mixed with english as it is in cameroon most of the population speaks english as their native language the major languages spoken in nigeria represent three major families of languages of africa the majority are niger-congo languages such as igbo yoruba and fulfulde kanuri spoken in the northeast primarily in borno and yobe state is part of the nilo-saharan family and hausa is an afroasiatic language even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages english as the official language is widely used for education business transactions and for official purposes english as a first language is used only by a small minority of the countrys urban elite and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in nigeria itself igbo hausa and yoruba but unlike the yorubas and igbos the hausas tend not to travel far outside nigeria itself with the majority of nigerias populace in the rural areas the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages some of the largest of these notably yoruba and igbo have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups nigerian pidgin english often known simply as pidgin or broken broken english is also a popular lingua franca though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang the pidgin english or nigerian english is widely spoken within the niger delta regions predominantly in warri sapele port

roman catholicism are observed in the ibibio annang efik and ijo lands of the south the 1963 census indicated that 47 of nigerians were muslim 35 christian and 18 members of local indigenous congregations if accurate this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 in the number of christians up 23 a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs compared with 20 and only a modest 6 drop of muslims which can likely be attributed to immigration emigration and birthrate the vast majority of muslims in nigeria are sunni belonging to maliki school of jurisprudence however a sizeable minority also belongs to shafi madhhab a large number of sunni muslims are members of sufi brotherhoods most sufis follow the qadiriyya tijaniyyah andor the mouride movements a significant shia minority exists

ravaging three other countries in the west african region the nigerian unique method of contact tracing employed by nigeria became an effective method later used by countries such as the united states when ebola threats were discovered the nigerian health care system is continuously faced with a shortage of doctors known as brain drain because of emigration by skilled nigerian doctors to north america and europe in 1995 it was estimated that 21000 nigerian doctors were practising in the united states alone which is about the same as the number of doctors working in the nigerian public
