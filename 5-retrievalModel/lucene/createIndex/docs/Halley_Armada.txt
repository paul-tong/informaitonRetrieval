the halley armada is the name of five space probes sent to examine halleys comet during its 1986 sojourn through the inner solar system connected with apparition 1p1982 u1 the armada consisted of one probe from the european space agency two probes that were joint projects between the soviet union and france and two probes from the institute of space and astronautical science of japan main space probes probes involved in order of closest approach giotto 596 km the first space probe to get close-up color images of the nucleus of a comet esa vega 2 8030 km which dropped a balloon probe and lander on venus before going on to halley ussrfrance intercosmos vega 1 8889 km which dropped a balloon probe and lander on venus before going on to halley ussrfrance intercosmos suisei 151000 km also known as planet-a data from sakigake was used to improve upon suisei for its dedicated mission to study halley isas sakigake 699 million km japans first probe to leave the earth system mainly a test of interplanetary mission technology isas without the measurements from the other space probes giottos closest distance would have been 4000km instead of the 596km achieved other space probes other space probes had their instruments examining halleys comet pioneer 7 was launched on august 17 1966 it was put into heliocentric orbit with a mean distance of 11 au to study the solar magnetic field the solar wind and cosmic rays at widely separated points in solar orbit on 20 march 1986 the spacecraft flew within 123 million kilometers of halleys comet and monitored the interaction between the cometary hydrogen tail and the solar wind pioneer venus orbiter in orbit of venus was positioned perfectly to take measurements of halleys comet during its perihelion february 9 1986 its uv-spectrometer observed the water loss when halleys comet was difficult to observe from the earth international cometary explorer which was repurposed as a cometary probe in 1982 and visited comet giacobini-zinner in 1985 transited between the sun and halleys comet in late march 1986 and took measurements presumed observations from space any observations of halleys comet made by the crew of soyuz t-15 which made the first trip to the mir space station and the last to salyut 7 in march 1986 are unknown image of halley in 1986 by giotto spacecraft esa giotto archiveorg 27 sep 2011
