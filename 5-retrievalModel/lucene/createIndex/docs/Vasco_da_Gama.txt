vasco da gama 1st count of vidigueira european portuguesevaku m c 1460s 24 december 1524 was a portuguese explorer and the first european to reach india by sea his initial voyage to india 14971499 was the first to link europe and asia by an ocean route connecting the atlantic and the indian oceans and therefore the west and the orient da gamas discovery of the sea route to india was significant and opened the way for an age of global imperialism and for the portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in asia traveling the ocean route allowed the portuguese to avoid sailing across the highly disputed mediterranean and traversing the dangerous arabian peninsula the sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then far longer than a full voyage around the world by way of the equator after decades of sailors trying to reach the indies with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks da gama landed in calicut on 20 may 1498 unopposed access to the indian spice routes boosted the economy of the portuguese empire which was previously based along northern and coastal west africa the main spices at first obtained from southeast asia were pepper and cinnamon but soon included other products all new to europe portugal maintained a commercial monopoly of these commodities for several decades it was not until a century later that other european powers namely the dutch republic and england followed by france and denmark were able to challenge portugals monopoly and naval supremacy in the cape route da gama led two of the portuguese india armadas the first and the fourth the latter was the largest and departed for india four years after his return from the first one for his contributions in 1524 da gama was appointed governor of india with the title of viceroy and was ennobled as count of vidigueira in 1519 vasco da gama remains a leading figure in the history of exploration numerous homages have been made worldwide to celebrate his explorations and accomplishments the portuguese national epic poem os lusadas was written in his honour by cames d1580 his first trip to india is widely considered a milestone in world history as it marked the beginning of a sea-based phase of global multiculturalism in march 2016 thousands of artifacts and nautical remains were recovered from the wreck of the ship esmeralda one of da gamas armada found off the coast of oman early life vasco da gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in the town of sines one of the few seaports on the alentejo coast southwest portugal probably in a house near the church of nossa senhora das salas vasco da gamas father was estvo da gama who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of infante ferdinand duke of viseu he rose in the ranks of the military order of santiago estvo da gama was appointed alcaide-mr civil governor of sines in the 1460s a post he held until 1478 after that he continued as a receiver of taxes and holder of the orders commendas in the region estvo da gama married isabel sodr a daughter of joo sodr also known as joo de resende scion of a well-connected family of english origin her father and her brothers vicente sodr and brs sodr had links to the household of infante diogo duke of viseu and were prominent figures in the military order of christ vasco da gama was the third of five sons of estvo da gama and isabel sodr in probable order of age paulo da gama joo sodr vasco da gama pedro da gama and aires da gama vasco also had one known sister teresa da gama who married lopo mendes de vasconcelos little is known of da gamas early life the portuguese historian teixeira de arago suggests that he studied at the inland town of vora which is where he may have learned mathematics and navigation it has been claimed that he studied under abraham zacuto an astrologer and astronomer but da gamas biographer subrahmanyam thinks this dubious around 1480 da gama followed his father rather than the sodrs and joined the order of santiago the master of santiago was prince john who ascended to the throne in 1481 as king john ii of portugal john ii doted on the order and the da gamas prospects rose accordingly in 1492 john ii dispatched da gama on a mission to the port of setbal and to the algarve to seize french ships in retaliation for peacetime depredations against portuguese shipping a task that da gama rapidly and effectively performed exploration before da gama from the earlier part of the 15th century portuguese expeditions organized by prince henry the navigator had been reaching down the african coastline principally in search of west african riches notably gold they had greatly extended portuguese maritime knowledge but had little profit to show for the effort after henrys death in 1460 the portuguese crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and in 1469 licensed the neglected african enterprise to a private lisbon merchant consortium led by ferno gomes within a few years gomes captains expanded portuguese knowledge across the gulf of guinea doing business in gold dust melegueta pepper ivory and sub-saharan slaves when gomes charter came up for renewal in 1474 prince john future john ii asked his father afonso v of portugal to pass the african charter to him upon becoming king in 1481 john ii of portugal set out on many long reforms to break the monarchs dependence on the feudal nobility john ii needed to build up the royal treasury he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that under john iis watch the gold and slave trade in west africa was greatly expanded he was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between europe and asia which was conducted chiefly by land at the time this was virtually monopolized by the republic of venice who operated overland routes via levantine and egyptian ports through the red sea across to the spice markets of india john ii set a new objective for his captains to find a sea route to asia by sailing around the african continent by the time vasco da gama was in his 20s the kings plans were coming to fruition in 1487 john ii dispatched two spies pero da covilh and afonso de paiva overland via egypt to east africa and india to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes the breakthrough came soon after when john iis captain bartolomeu dias returned from rounding the cape of good hope in 1488 having explored as far as the fish river rio do infante in modern-day south africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast an explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of dias and those of da covilh and de paiva and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the indian ocean first voyage on 8 july 1497 vasco da gama led a fleet of four ships with a crew of 170 men from lisbon the distance traveled in the journey around africa to india and back was greater than around the equator the navigators included portugals most experienced pero de alenquer pedro escobar joo de coimbra and afonso gonalves it is not known for certain how many people were in each ships crew but approximately 55 returned and two ships were lost two of the vessels were carracks newly built for the voyage the others were a caravel and a supply boat the four ships were so gabriel commanded by vasco da gama a carrack of 178 tons length 27 m width 85 m draft 23 m sails of 372 m so rafael commanded by his brother paulo da gama similar dimensions to the so gabriel berrio nickname officially called so miguel a caravel slightly smaller than the former two commanded by nicolau coelho a storage ship of unknown name commanded by gonalo nunes destined to be scuttled in mossel bay so brs in south africa journey to the cape the expedition set sail from lisbon on 8 july 1497 it followed the route pioneered by earlier explorers along the coast of africa via tenerife and the cape verde islands after reaching the coast of present-day sierra leone da gama took a course south into the open ocean crossing the equator and seeking the south atlantic westerlies that bartolomeu dias had discovered in 1487 this course proved successful and on 4 november 1497 the expedition made landfall on the african coast for over three months the ships had sailed more than 10000 kilometres 6000mi of open ocean by far the longest journey out of sight of land made by that time by 16 december the fleet had passed the great fish river eastern cape south africa where dias had anchored and sailed into waters previously unknown to europeans with christmas pending da gama and his crew gave the coast they were passing the name natal which carried the connotation of birth of christ in portuguese mozambique vasco da gama spent 2 to 29 march 1498 in the vicinity of mozambique island arab-controlled territory on the east african coast was an integral part of the network of trade in the indian ocean fearing the local population would be hostile to christians da gama impersonated a muslim and gained audience with the sultan of mozambique with the paltry trade goods he had to offer the explorer was unable to provide a suitable gift to the ruler soon the local populace became suspicious of da gama and his men forced by a hostile crowd to flee mozambique da gama departed the harbor firing his cannons into the city in retaliation mombasa in the vicinity of modern kenya the expedition resorted to piracy looting arab merchant ships that were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons the portuguese became the first known europeans to visit the port of mombasa from 7 to 13 april 1498 but were met with hostility and soon departed malindi vasco da gama continued north arriving on 14 april 1498 at the friendlier port of malindi whose leaders were having a conflict with those of mombasa there the expedition first noted evidence of indian traders da gama and his crew contracted the services of a pilot who used his knowledge of the monsoon winds to guide the expedition the rest of the way to calicut located on the southwest coast of india sources differ over the identity of the pilot calling him variously a christian a muslim and a gujarati one traditional story describes the pilot as the famous arab navigator ibn majid but other contemporaneous accounts place majid elsewhere and he could not have been near the vicinity at the time none of the portuguese historians of the time mentions ibn majid vasco da gama left malindi for india on 24 april 1498 calicut india the fleet arrived in kappadu near kozhikode calicut in malabar coast present day kerala state of india on 20 may 1498 the king of calicut the samudiri zamorin who was at that time staying in his second capital at ponnani returned to calicut on hearing the news of the foreign fleetss arrival the navigator was received with traditional hospitality including a grand procession of at least 3000 armed nairs but an interview with the zamorin failed to produce any concrete results when local authorities asked da gamas fleet what brought you hither they replied that they had come in search of christians and spices the presents that da gama sent to the zamorin as gifts from dom manuel four cloaks of scarlet cloth six hats four branches of corals twelve almasares a box with seven brass vessels a chest of sugar two barrels of oil and a cask of honey were trivial and failed to impress while zamorins officials wondered at why there was no gold or silver the muslim merchants who considered da gama their rival suggested that the latter was only an ordinary pirate and not a royal ambassador vasco da gamas request for permission to leave a factor behind him in charge of the merchandise he could not sell was turned down by the king who insisted that da gama pay customs duty preferably in gold like any other trader which strained the relation between the two annoyed by this da gama carried a few nairs and sixteen fishermen mukkuva off with him by force return vasco da gama left calicut on 29 august 1498 eager to set sail for home he ignored the local knowledge of monsoon wind patterns that were still blowing onshore the fleet initially inched north along the indian coast and then anchored in at anjediva island for a spell they finally struck out for their indian ocean crossing on 3 october 1498 but with the winter monsoon yet to set in it was a harrowing journey on the outgoing journey sailing with the summer monsoon wind da gamas fleet crossed the indian ocean in only 23 days now on the return trip sailing against the wind it took 132 days da gama saw land again only on 2 january 1499 passing before the coastal somali city of mogadishu then under the influence of the ajuran empire in the horn of africa the fleet did not make a stop but passing before mogadishu the anonymous diarist of the expedition noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its center and many mosques with cylindrical minarets da gamas fleet finally arrived in malindi on 7 january 1499 in a terrible state approximately half of the crew had died during the crossing and many of the rest were afflicted with scurvy not having enough crewmen left standing to manage three ships da gama ordered the so rafael scuttled off the east african coast and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships the so gabriel and the berrio thereafter the sailing was smoother by early march they had arrived in mossel bay and crossed the cape of good hope in the opposite direction on 20 march reaching the west african coast by 25 april the diary record of the expedition ends abruptly here reconstructing from other sources it seems they continued to cape verde where nicolau coelhos berrio separated from vasco da gamas so gabriel and sailed on by itself the berrio arrived in lisbon on 10 july 1499 and nicolau coelho personally delivered the news to king manuel i and the royal court then assembled in sintra in the meantime back in cape verde da gamas brother paulo da gama had fallen grievously ill da gama elected to stay by his side on santiago island and handed the so gabriel over to his clerk joo de s to take home the so gabriel under s arrived in lisbon sometime in late july or early august da gama and his sickly brother eventually hitched a ride with a guinea caravel returning to portugal but paulo da gama died en route da gama disembarked at the azores to bury his brother at the monastery of so francisco in angra do heroismo and lingered there for a little while in mourning he eventually took passage on an azorean caravel and finally arrived in lisbon on 29 august 1499 according to barros or early september 8th or 18th according to other sources despite his melancholic mood da gama was given a heros welcome and showered with honors including a triumphal procession and public festivities king manuel wrote two letters in which he described da gamas first voyage in july and august 1499 soon after the return of the ships girolamo sernigi also wrote three letters describing da gamas first voyage soon after the return of the expedition the expedition had exacted a large cost two ships and over half the men had been lost it had also failed in its principal mission of securing a commercial treaty with calicut nonetheless the small quantities of spices and other trade goods brought back on the remaining two ships demonstrated the potential of great profit for future trade vasco da gama was justly celebrated for opening a direct sea route to asia his path would be followed up thereafter by yearly portuguese india armadas the spice trade would prove to be a major asset to the portuguese royal treasury and other consequences soon followed for example da gamas voyage had made it clear that the east coast of africa the contra costa was essential to portuguese interests its ports provided fresh water provisions timber and harbors for repairs and served as a refuge where ships could wait out unfavorable weather one significant result was the colonization of mozambique by the portuguese crown rewards in december 1499 king manuel i of portugal rewarded vasco da gama with the town of sines as a hereditary fief the town his father estvo had once held as a commenda this turned out to be a complicated affair for sines still belonged to the order of santiago the master of the order jorge de lencastre might have endorsed the reward after all da gama was a santiago knight one of their own and a close associate of lencastre himself but the fact that sines was awarded by the king provoked lencastre to refuse out of principle lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the orders properties da gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of sines an effort that would estrange him from lencastre and eventually prompt da gama to abandon his beloved order of santiago switching over to the rival order of christ in 1507 in the meantime da gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300000 reis he was awarded the noble title of dom lord in perpetuity for himself his siblings and their descendants on 30 january 1502 da gama was awarded the title of almirante dos mares de arabia persia india e de todo o oriente admiral of the seas of arabia persia india and all the orient an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate castilian title borne by christopher columbus evidently manuel must have reckoned that if castile had an admiral of the ocean seas then surely portugal should have one too another royal letter dated october 1501 gave da gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on any future india-bound fleet around 1501 vasco da gama married catarina de atade daughter of lvaro de atade the alcaide-mr of alvor algarve and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful almeida family catarina was a first cousin of d francisco de almeida second voyage the follow-up expedition the second india armada launched in 1500 under the command of pedro lvares cabral with the mission of making a treaty with the zamorin of calicut and setting up a portuguese factory in the city however pedro cabral entered into a conflict with the local arab merchant guilds with the result that the portuguese factory was overrun in a riot and up to 70 portuguese were killed cabral blamed the zamorin for the incident and bombarded the city thus war broke out between portugal and calicut vasco da gama invoked his royal letter to take command of the 4th india armada scheduled to set out in 1502 with the explicit aim of taking revenge upon the zamorin and force him to submit to portuguese terms the heavily armed fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men left lisbon on 12 february 1502 it was followed in april by another squadron of five ships led by his cousin estvo da gama the son of aires da gama which caught up to them in the indian ocean the 4th armada was a veritable da gama family affair two of his maternal uncles vicente sodr and brs sodr were pre-designated to command an indian ocean naval patrol while brothers-in-law lvaro de atade brother of vascos wife catarina and lopo mendes de vasconcelos betrothed to teresa da gama vascos sister captained ships in the main fleet on the outgoing voyage da gamas fleet opened contact with the east african gold trading port of sofala and reduced the sultanate of kilwa to tribute extracting a substantial sum of gold on reaching india in october 1502 da gamas fleet set about capturing any arab vessel he came across in indian waters most notoriously the miri a pilgrim ship from mecca whose passengers he massacred in open water he then appeared before calicut demanding redress for the treatment of cabral while the zamorin was willing to sign a new treaty da gama made a call to the hindu king to expel all muslims from calicut before beginning negotiations which was turned down the portuguese fleet then bombarded the city for nearly two days from the sea shore severely damaging the unfortified city he also captured several rice vessels and cut off the crews hands ears and noses dispatching them with an insulting note to the zamorin the violent treatment meted out by da gama quickly brought trade along the malabar coast of india upon which calicut depended to a standstill but the zamorin nonetheless refused to submit to portuguese terms and even ventured to hire a fleet of strong warships to challenge da gamas armada which da gama managed to defeat in a naval battle before calicut harbor da gama loaded up with spices at cochin and cannanore small nearby kingdoms half-vassal and half-at-war with the zamorin whose alliances had been secured by prior portuguese fleets the 4th armada left india in early 1503 da gama left behind a small squadron of caravels under the command of his uncle vicente sodr to patrol the indian coast to continue harassing calicut shipping and to protect the portuguese factories at cochin and cannanore from the zamorins inevitable reprisals vasco da gama arrived back in portugal in september 1503 effectively having failed in his mission to bring the zamorin to submission this failure and the subsequent more galling failure of his uncle vicente sodr to protect the portuguese factory in cochin probably counted against any further rewards when the portuguese king manuel i of portugal decided to appoint the first governor and viceroy of portuguese india in 1505 da gama was conspicuously overlooked and the post given to francisco de almeida pilgrim ship incident on his second voyage vasco da gama inflicted acts of cruelty upon competing traders and local inhabitants which sealed his notoriety in india during his second voyage to calicut da gama intercepted a ship of muslim pilgrims at madayi travelling from calicut to mecca described in detail by eyewitness thom lopes and chronicler gaspar correia da gama looted the ship with over 400 pilgrims on board including 50 women locked in the passengers the owner and an ambassador from egypt and burned them to death they offered their wealth which could ransom all the christian slaves in the kingdom of fez and much more but were not spared da gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy after demanding the expulsion of muslims from calicut to the hindu zamorin the latter sent the high priest talappana namboothiri the very same person who conducted da gama to the zamorins chamber during his much celebrated first visit to calicut in may 1498 for talks da gama called him a spy ordered the priests lips and ears to be cut off and after sewing a pair of dogs ears to his head sent him away interlude for the next two decades vasco da gama lived out a quiet life unwelcome in the royal court and sidelined from indian affairs his attempts to return to the favor of manuel i including switching over to the order of christ in 1507 yielded little almeida the larger-than-life afonso de albuquerque and later on albergaria and sequeira were the kings preferred point men for india after ferdinand magellan defected to the crown of castile in 1518 vasco da gama threatened to do the same prompting the king to undertake steps to retain him in portugal and avoid the embarrassment of losing his own admiral of the indies to spain in 1519 after years of ignoring his petitions king manuel i finally hurried to give vasco da gama a feudal title appointing him the first count of vidigueira a count title created by a royal decree issued in vora on 29 december after a complicated agreement with dom jaime duke of braganza who ceded him on payment the towns of vidigueira and vila dos frades the decree granted vasco da gama and his heirs all the revenues and privileges related thus establishing da gama as the first portuguese count who was not born with royal blood third voyage and death after the death of king manuel i in late 1521 his son and successor king john iii of portugal set about reviewing the portuguese government overseas turning away from the old albuquerque clique now represented by diogo lopes de sequeira john iii looked for a fresh start vasco da gama re-emerged from his political wilderness as an important adviser to the new kings appointments and strategy seeing the new spanish threat to the maluku islands as the priority vasco da gama advised against the obsession with arabia that had pervaded much of the manueline period and continued to be the dominant concern of duarte de menezes then-governor of portuguese india menezes also turned out to be incompetent and corrupt subject to numerous complaints as a result john iii decided to appoint vasco da gama himself to replace menezes confident that the magic of his name and memory of his deeds might better impress his authority on portuguese india and manage the transition to a new government and new strategy by his appointment letter of february 1524 john iii granted vasco da gama the privileged title of viceroy being only the second portuguese governor to enjoy that title the first was francisco de almeida in 1505 his second son estvo da gama was simultaneously appointed capito-mor do mar da ndia captain-major of the indian sea commander of the indian ocean naval patrol fleet to replace duartes brother lus de menezes as a final condition gama secured from john iii of portugal the commitment to appoint all his sons successively as portuguese captains of malacca setting out in april 1524 with a fleet of fourteen ships vasco da gama took as his flagship the famous large carrack santa catarina do monte sinai on her last journey to india along with two of his sons estvo and paulo after a troubled journey four or five of the ships were lost en route he arrived in india in september vasco da gama immediately invoked his high viceregent powers to impose a new order in portuguese india replacing all the old officials with his own appointments but gama contracted malaria not long after arriving and died in the city of cochin on christmas eve in 1524 three months after his arrival as per royal instructions da gama was succeeded as governor of india by one the captains who had come with him henrique de menezes no relation to duarte da gamas sons estvo and paulo immediately lost their posts and joined the returning fleet of early 1525 along with the dismissed duarte de menezes and lus de menezes vasco da gamas body was first buried at st francis church which was located at fort kochi in the city of kochi but his remains were returned to portugal in 1539 the body of vasco da gama was re-interred in vidigueira in a casket decorated with gold and jewels the monastery of the hieronymites in belm which would become the necropolis of the portuguese royal dynasty of aviz was erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of vasco da gamas first journey and its construction funded by a tax on the profits of the yearly portuguese india armadas in 1880 da gamas remains and those of the poet lus de cames who celebrated da gamas first voyage in his 1572 epic poem the lusiad were moved to new carved tombs in the nave of the monasterys church only a few meters away from the tombs of the kings manuel i and john iii whom da gama had served marriage and issue vasco da gama and his wife catarina de atade had six sons and one daughter dom francisco da gama who inherited his fathers titles as 2nd count of vidigueira and the 2nd admiral of the seas of india arabia and persia he remained in portugal dom estevo da gama after his abortive 1524 term as indian patrol captain he was appointed for a three-year term as captain of malacca serving from 1534 to 1539 includes the last two years of his brother paulos term he was subsequently appointed as the 11th governor of india from 1540 to 1542 dom paulo da gama captain of malacca in 153334 killed in a naval action off malacca dom cristovo da gama captain of malacca fleet from 1538 to 1540 nominated to succeed in malacca but executed by ahmad ibn ibrahim during the

female line titles styles and honours over his numerous years serving the portuguese crown da gama was rewarded with many different titles distinctions and offices admiral of the seas of arabia persia india and all the orient title as chief of the portuguese india armadas 2nd viceroy of india title of office as colonial head of portuguese india 1st count of vidigueira title of portuguese nobility ancestry legacy vasco da gama is one of the most famous and celebrated explorers from the age of discovery as much as anyone after henry the navigator he was responsible for portugals success as an early colonising power beside the fact of the first voyage itself it was his astute mix of politics and war on the other side of the world that placed portugal in a prominent position in indian ocean trade following da gamas initial voyage the portuguese crown realized that securing outposts on the eastern coast of africa would prove vital to maintaining national trade routes to the far east however his fame is tempered by such incidents and attitudes as displayed in the notorious pilgrim ship incident previously discussed the portuguese national epic the lusadas of lus vaz de cames largely concerns vasco da gamas voyages the 1865 grand opera lafricaine opra en cinq actes composed by giacomo meyerbeer from a libretto by eugne scribe prominently includes the character of vasco da

in the role of da gama the 19th-century composer louis-albert bourgault-ducoudray composed an eponymous 1872 opera based on da gamas life and exploits at sea the port city of vasco da gama in goa is named after him as is the crater vasco da gama on the moon there are three football clubs in brazil including club de regatas vasco da gama and vasco sports club in goa that were also named after him there exists a church in kochi kerala called vasco da gama church and a private residence on the island of saint helena the suburb of vasco in cape town also honours him a few places in lisbons parque das naes are named after the explorer such as the vasco da gama bridge vasco da gama tower and the centro comercial vasco da gama shopping centre the oceanrio in the parque das naes has a mascot of a cartoon diver with the name of vasco who is named after the explorer vasco da gama was the only explorer on the final pool of os grandes portugueses although the final shortlist featured other age of discovery related people they were not actually explorers nor navigators for any matter the portuguese navy has a class of frigates named after him there are three vasco da gama class frigates in total of which the first one also bears his name south african musician hugh masekela recorded an anti-colonialist song entitled colonial man which contains the lyrics vasco da gama was no friend of mine and another song entitled vasco da gama the sailor man both songs were included in his 1976 album colonial man vasco da gama appears as an antagonist in the indian film urumi the film directed by santosh sivan depicts a failed assassination attempt on da gama by an indian in march 2016 archaeologists working off the coast of oman identified a shipwreck believed to be that of the esmeralda from

and blue water recoveries ltd a shipwreck recovery company the vessel was identified through such artifacts as a portuguese coin minted for trade with india one of only two coins of this type known to
