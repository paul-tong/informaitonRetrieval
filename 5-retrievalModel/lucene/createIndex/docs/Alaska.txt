the bering strait from asia the canadian province of british columbia and territory of yukon border the state to the east its most extreme western part is attu island and it has a maritime border with russia chukotka autonomous okrug to the west across the bering strait to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seassouthern parts of the arctic ocean the pacific ocean lies to the south and southwest it is the largest state in the united states by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world in addition it is the 3rd least populous and the most sparsely populated of the 50 united states nevertheless it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel in north america its populationestimated at 738432 by the united states census bureau in 2015 is more than quadruple the combined populations of northern canada and greenland approximately half of alaskas residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area alaskas economy is dominated by the fishing natural gas and oil industries resources which it has in abundance military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy the united states purchased alaska from the russian empire on march 30 1867 for 72million us dollars at approximately two cents per acre 474km the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on may 11 1912 it was admitted as the 49th state of the us on january 3 1959 etymology the name alaska russian tr alyaska was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the alaska peninsula it was derived from an aleut-language idiom which figuratively refers to the mainland literally it means object to which the action of the sea is directed geography alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere alaska is the only non-contiguous us state on continental north america about 500 miles 800km of british columbia canada separates alaska from washington it is technically part of the continental us but is sometimes not included in colloquial use alaska is not part of the contiguous us often called the lower 48 the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system the state is bordered by yukon and british columbia in canada to the east the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north alaskas territorial waters touch russias territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only 3 miles 48km apart alaska has a longer coastline than all the other us states combined alaska is the largest state in the united states by total area at 663268 square miles 1717856km over twice the size of texas the next largest state alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries counting territorial waters alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states texas california and montana it is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest us states regions there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions south central the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuska-susitna valley and the kenai peninsula rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez southeast also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states as such this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka and ketchikan at one time alaskas largest city the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area as only three communities haines hyder and skagway enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system officially designated in 1963 interior the interior is the largest region of alaska much of it is uninhabited wilderness fairbanks is the only large city in the region denali national park and preserve is located here denali is the highest mountain in north america southwest southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles 800km inland from the bering sea most of the population lives along the coast kodiak island is also located in southwest the massive yukonkuskokwim delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands see below north slope the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reservealaska and the prudhoe bay oil field the city of utqiagvik formerly known as barrow is the northernmost city in the united states and is located here the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region however the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people aleutian islands more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over 1200 miles 1900km into the pacific ocean some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of 180 to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii natural features with its myriad islands alaska has nearly 34000 miles 55000km of tidal shoreline the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 feet 3000m above the north pacific it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japans mount fuji the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing continent building one of the worlds largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage where tidal differences can be more than 35 feet 107m alaska has more than three million lakes marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188320 square miles 487700km mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands glacier ice covers about 28957 square miles 75000km of alaska the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america covering 2008 square miles 5200km alone land ownership according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management approximately 65 of alaska is owned and managed by the us federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages 87million acres 35million hectares or 238 of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service it is the worlds largest wildlife refuge comprising 16million acres 65million hectares of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns 101million acres 41million hectares its entitlement under the alaska statehood act a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently another 44million acres 18million hectares are owned by 12 regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa of 1971 regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans but cannot sell the land individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded climate the climate in southeast alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate kppen climate classification cfb in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate kppen cfc in the northern parts on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year juneau averages over 50in 130cm of precipitation a year and ketchikan averages over 150in 380cm this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer on average anchorage receives 16in 41cm of precipitation a year with around 75in 190cm of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow it is a subarctic climate kppen dfc due to its brief cool summers the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley ie the region around kotzebue sound is technically a desert with portions receiving less than 10in 25cm of precipitation annually on the other extreme some locations between dillingham and bethel average around 100in 250cm of precipitation the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s f the low-to-mid 30s c while in the winter the temperature can fall below 60f 51c precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than 10in 25cm a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior the highest is 100f 38c in fort yukon which is just 8mi or 13km inside the arctic circle on june 27 1915 making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states the lowest official alaska temperature is 80f 62c in prospect creek on january 23 1971 one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america in snag yukon canada the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic kppen et with long very cold winters and short cool summers even in july the average low temperature in utqiagvik is 34f 1c precipitation is light in this part of alaska with many places averaging less than 10in 25cm per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year history pre-colonization numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge at the upward sun river site in the tanana river valley in alaska remains of a six-week-old infant were found the babys dna showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the new world at the end of the pleistocene ben potter the university of alaska fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the upward river sun site in 2013 named this new group ancient beringians the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 when president grover cleveland and later the us congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s resulting in high fatalities and social disruption the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut peoples seafaring society although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by russians western and southwestern alaska are home to the yupik while their cousins the alutiiq sugpiaq lived in what is now southcentral alaska the gwichin people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested arctic national wildlife refuge the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people colonization some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century according to this hypothesis in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in 17641765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor m s gvozdev and assistant navigator i fyodorov on august 21 1732 during an expedition of siberian cossak a f shestakov and belarusian explorer dmitry pavlutsky 17291735 another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784 between 1774 and 1800 spain sent several expeditions to alaska in order to assert its claim over the pacific northwest in 1789 a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez bucareli sound and cordova later the russian-american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century sitka renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast alaska on march 30 1867 the united states purchased alaska from the russian empire for the sum of 72 million it was not until october of that year that the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was arranged the formal flag-raising took place at fort sitka on october 18 1867 the original ceremony included 250 uniformed us soldiers who marched to the governors house at castle hill here the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the us flag was raised this event is celebrated as alaska day a legal holiday on the 18th of october william h seward the united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase also known as sewards folly with the russians in 1867 for 72million alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in 1884 with a governor appointed by the president of the united states a federal district court was headquartered in sitka for most of alaskas first decade under the united states flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers they organized a provisional city government which was alaskas first municipal government but not in a legal sense legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959 territory starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 alaskas capital which had been in sitka until 1906 was moved north to juneau construction of the alaska governors mansion began that same year european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska where they entered the fishing and logging industries during world war ii the aleutian islands campaign focused on the three outer aleutian islands attu agattu and kiska that were invaded by japanese troops and occupied between june 1942 and august 1943 during the occupation one aleut civilian was killed by japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in japan where about half of them died unalaskadutch harbor became a significant base for the united states army air forces and navy submariners the united states lend-lease program involved the flying of american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities statehood statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 the alaska statehood committee and alaskas constitutional convention would soon follow statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the us congress but also within alaska statehood was approved by congress on july 7 1958 alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 1959 in 1960 the census bureau reported alaskas population as 772 white 3 black and 188 american indian and alaska native good friday earthquake on march 27 1964 the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides it was the second-most-powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world with a moment magnitude of 92 it was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 san francisco earthquake the time of day 536pm time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage discovery of oil the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the trans-alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward that same year not coincidentally alaska repealed its state income tax in 1989 the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound spilling over 11 million us gallons 42 megaliters of crude oil over 1100 miles 1800km of coastline today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine alaska heritage resources survey the alaska heritage resources survey ahrs is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology the surveys inventory of cultural resources includes objects structures buildings sites districts and travel ways with a general provision that they are over 50 years old as of january31 2012 over 35000 sites have been reported demographics the united states census bureau estimates that the population of alaska was 738432 on july 1 2015 a 397 increase since the 2010 united states census in 2010 alaska ranked as the 47th state by population ahead of north dakota vermont and wyoming and washington dc estimates show north dakota ahead as of 2017 alaska is the least densely populated state and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world at 12 inhabitants per square mile 046km with the next state wyoming at 58 inhabitants per square mile 22km alaska is the largest us state by area and the tenth wealthiest per capita income as of november2014 the states unemployment rate was 66 as of 2018 it is one of 14 us states that still has only one telephone area code race and ethnicity according to the 2010 united states census alaska had a population of 710231 in terms of race and ethnicity the state was 667 white 641 non-hispanic white 148 american indian and alaska native 54 asian 33 black or african american 10 native hawaiian and other pacific islander 16 from some other race and 73 from two or more races hispanics or latinos of any race made up 55 of the population as of 2011 507 of alaskas population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups ie did not have two parents of non-hispanic white ancestry languages according to the 2011 american community survey 834 of people over the age of five speak only english at home about 35 speak spanish at home about 22 speak another indo-european language at home and about 43 speak an asian language including tagalog at home about 53 speak other languages at home the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 20 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects most of alaskas native languages belong to either the eskimoaleut or na-dene language families however some languages are thought to be isolates eg haida or have not yet been classified eg tsimshianic as of 2014 nearly all of alaskas native languages were classified as either threatened shifting moribund nearly extinct or dormant languages a total of 52 of alaskans speak one of the states 20 indigenous languages known locally as native languages in october 2014 the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the states 20 indigenous languages as official languages this bill gave the languages symbolic recognition as official languages though they have not been adopted for official use within the government the 20 languages that were included in the bill are inupiaq siberian yupik central alaskan yupik alutiiq unangax denaina deg xinag holikachuk koyukon upper kuskokwim gwichin tanana upper tanana tanacross hn ahtna eyak tlingit haida tsimshian religion according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives from 2010 about 34 of alaska residents were members of religious congregations 100960 people identified as evangelical protestants 50866 as roman catholic and 32550 as mainline protestants roughly 4 are mormon 05 are jewish 1 are muslim 05 are buddhist 02 are bah and 05 are hindu the largest religious denominations in alaska as of 2010 were the catholic church with 50866 adherents non-denominational evangelical protestants with 38070 adherents the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints with 32170 adherents and the southern baptist convention with 19891 adherents alaska has been identified along with pacific northwest states washington and oregon as being the least religious states of the usa in terms of church membership in 1795 the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society as a result an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska alaska also has the largest quaker population by percentage of any state in 2009 there were 6000 jews in alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities including sikhs and jains estimates for the number of muslims in alaska range from 2000 to 5000 the islamic community center of anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in anchorage they broke ground on a building in south anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014 when completed the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world theres also a bah center economy the 2007 gross state product was 449billion 45th in the nation its per capita personal income for 2007 was 40042 ranking 15th in the nation according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of 675 percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than 80 of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaskas main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging energy alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the united states typically producing about 400000 barrels per day 64000md although by early 2014 north dakotas bakken formation was producing over 900000 barrels per day 140000md prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canadas enormous athabasca oil sands field which by 2014 was producing about 1500000 barrels per day 240000md of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate the trans-alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 21 million barrels 330000m of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaskas bituminous sub-bituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are 854trillion cubic feet 2420km of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems eg with special low-cost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report 2001 due to low less than 50gal fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually 3060 higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors permanent fund the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to 900 million at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of 734000 the fund has grown to 50billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum starting in 1982 dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial 1000 in 1982 equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to 3269 in 2008 which included a one-time 1200 resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and active-duty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure agriculture and fishing due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about 40 miles 64km northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about 60 miles 97km southwest of anchorage the short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about 100 miles 160km southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and community-supported agriculture alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase 46 in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 compared to 17 nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market alaska with no counties lacks county fairs however a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 per pound 110kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a 1 us gallon 38l of milk is about 350 in many villages where per capita income can be 20000 or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely 2030 higher than the continental united states average with only hawaii having higher prices transportation roads alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the us the states road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska the interstate highways in alaska consists of a total of 1082 miles one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about 50 miles 80km southeast of anchorage at portage at 25 miles 40km the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007 the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america rail built around 1915 the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward ie coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country a stretch of about 60 miles 100km of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways the alaska rail network is not connected to outside in 2000 the us congress authorized 6million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower 48 alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle marine transport many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea alaskas well-developed state-owned ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway the inter-island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaskas gulf coast the population of ketchikan may rise by over 10000 people on many days during the summer as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock debarking thousands of passengers air transport cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaskas extremely well developed bush air servicesan alaskan novelty anchorage and to a lesser extent fairbanks is served by many major airlines because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in 20122013 alaska received almost 2 million visitors regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737-400s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the worlds busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in 2006 alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any us state other transport another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times that is any time after the mid-late 1920s dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a 1150-mile 1850km trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at 1049 miles or 1688km the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay leaving from the community of nenana southwest of fairbanks to nome in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska data transport alaskas internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 2011 alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across alaska in january 2011 it was reported that a 1 billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by 350 million in stimulus from the federal government law and government state government like all other us states alaska is governed as a republic with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and his appointees which head executive departments a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts the state of alaska employs approximately 16000 people statewide the alaska legislature consists of a 40-member house of representatives and a 20-member senate senators serve four-year terms and house members two the governor of alaska serves four-year terms the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries but during the general election the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket alaskas court system has four levels the alaska supreme court the alaska court of appeals the superior courts and the district courts the superior and district courts are trial courts superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts only hear certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to 100000 the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals state politics although in its early years of statehood alaska was a democratic state since the early 1970s it has been characterized as republican-leaning local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights alaska natives while organized in and around their communities have been active within the native corporations these have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in ones home was completely legal under state law though the federal law remains in force the state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the united states with the alaskan independence party six republicans and four democrats have served as governor of alaska in addition republican governor wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the republican party and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected he officially rejoined the republican party in 1994 alaskas voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on february 24 2015 placing alaska alongside colorado and washington as the first three us states where recreational marijuana is legal the new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot if they can find it there is a rather lengthy and involved application process per alaska measure 2 2014 the first legal marijuana store opened in valdez in october 2016 taxes to finance state government operations alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states it is one of five states with no state sales tax one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax and one of the two states that has neither new hampshire is the other one the department of revenue tax division reports regularly on the states revenue sources the department also issues an annual summary of its operations including new state laws that directly affect the tax division while alaska has no state sales tax 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax from 1075 typically 35 other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel and bed-and-breakfast bed taxes severance taxes liquor and tobacco taxes gaming pull tabs taxes tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes a part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees such as petroleum aviation motor fuel telephone cooperative is shared with municipalities in alaska fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the fairbanks north star borough fnsb a sales tax for the fnsb has been voted on many times but has yet to be approved leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco in 2014 the tax foundation ranked alaska as having the fourth most business friendly tax policy behind only wyoming south dakota and nevada federal politics alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood republicans have won the states electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in 1964 no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon b johnson during his landslide election in 1964 while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close since 1972 however republicans have carried the state by large margins in 2008 republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska 5949 to 3783 mccains running mate was sarah palin the states governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket obama lost alaska again in 2012 but he captured 40 of the states vote in that election making him the first democrat to do so since 1968 the alaska bush central juneau midtown and downtown anchorage and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party the matanuska-susitna borough the majority of fairbanks including north pole and the military base and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing as of 2004 well over half of all registered voters have chosen non-partisan or undeclared as their affiliation despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters because of its population relative to other us states alaska has only one member in the us house of representatives this seat is held by republican don young who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012 alaskas at-large congressional district is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world by area in 2008 governor sarah palin became the first republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became john mccains running mate she continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governors job in july 2009 alaskas united states senators belong to class 2 and class 3 in 2008 democrat mark begich mayor of anchorage defeated long-time republican senator ted stevens stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on senate financial discloser forms one week before the election the conviction was set aside in april 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged republican frank murkowski held the states other senatorial position after being elected governor in 2002 he resigned from the senate and appointed his daughter state representative lisa murkowski as his successor she won full six-year terms in 2004 2010 and 2016 alaskas current statewide elected officials mike dunleavy governor mike dunleavy governor lisa murkowski senior united

states representative cities towns and boroughs alaska is not divided into counties as most of the other us states but it is divided into boroughs many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaskas 16 boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states however unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the us census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation a recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in alaska the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc for accepting documents into the public record whereas many us states use a three-tiered system of decentralizationstatecountytownshipmost of alaska uses only two tiersstateborough owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the unorganized borough as the name implies it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government in 2000 5771 of alaskas area has this status with 1305 of the population anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage containing the city proper and the

in the rural expanse of alaska known as the bush and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network the table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in alaska in population order of alaskas 2010 census population figure of 710231 20429 people or 288 of the population did not live in an incorporated city or

have police training but do not carry firearms in much of the state the troopers serve as the only police force available in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers duties they employ a wide variety of land air and water patrol vehicles many rural communities in alaska are considered dry having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the
