the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa kokuritsu-kenky-kaihatsu-hjin uch kk kenky kaihatsu kik literally national research and development agency on aerospace research and development is the japanese national aerospace and space agency through the merger of three previously independent organizations jaxa was formed on 1 october 2003 jaxa is responsible for research technology development and launch of satellites into orbit and is involved in many more advanced missions such as asteroid exploration and possible manned exploration of the moon its motto is one jaxa and its corporate slogan is explore to realize formerly reaching for the skies exploring space history on 1 october 2003 three organizations were merged to form the new jaxa japans institute of space and astronautical science isas the national aerospace laboratory of japan nal and national space development agency of japan nasda jaxa was formed as an independent administrative institution administered by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext and the ministry of internal affairs and communications mic before the merger isas was responsible for space and planetary research while nal was focused on aviation research nasda which was founded on 1 october 1969 had developed rockets satellites and also built the japanese experiment module the old nasda headquarters were located at the current site of the tanegashima space center on tanegashima island 115 kilometers south of kysh nasda also trained japanese astronauts who flew with the us space shuttles the basic space law was passed in 2008 and the jurisdictional authority of jaxa moved from mext to the strategic headquarters for space development shsd in the cabinet led by the prime minister in 2016 the national space policy secretariat nsps was set up the cabinet in 2012 new legislation extended jaxas remit from peaceful purposes only to include some military space development such as missile early warning systems political control of jaxa passed from mext to the prime ministers cabinet office through a new space strategy office organization jaxa is composed of the following organizations space technology directorate i space technology directorate ii human spaceflight technology directorate research and development directorate aeronautical technology directorate institute of space and astronautical science isas space exploration innovation hub center jaxa has research centers in many locations in japan and some offices overseas its headquarters are in chfu tokyo it also has earth observation research center eorc tokyo earth observation center eoc in hatoyama saitama noshiro testing center ntc in noshiro akita established in 1962 it carries out development and testing of rocket engines sanriku balloon center sbc balloons have been launched from this site since 1971 kakuda space center kspc in kakuda miyagi leads the development of rocket engines works mainly with development of liquid fuel engines sagamihara campus isas development of experimental equipment for rockets and satellites also administrative buildings tanegashima space center currently the launch site for the h-iia and h-iib rockets tsukuba space center tksc in tsukuba this is the center of japans space network it is involved in research and development of satellites and rockets and tracking and controlling of satellites it develops experimental equipment for the japanese experiment module kibo training of astronauts also takes place here for international space station operations the japanese flight control team is located at the space station integration promotion center ssipc in tsukuba ssipc communicates regularly with iss crewmembers via s-band audio uchinoura space center currently the launch site for the epsilon rocket rockets jaxa uses the h-iia h three a rocket from the former nasda body and its variant h-iib to launch engineering test satellites weather satellites etc for science missions like x-ray astronomy jaxa uses the epsilon rocket for experiments in the upper atmosphere jaxa uses the ss-520 s-520 and s-310 sounding rockets successes prior to the establishment of jaxa isas had been most successful in its space program in the field of x-ray astronomy during the 1980s and 1990s another successful area for japan has been very long baseline interferometry vlbi with the halca mission additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the magnetosphere among other areas nasda was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology however since the satellite market of japan is completely open the first time a japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005 another prime focus of the nasda body is earth climate observation jaxa was awarded the space foundations john l jack swigert jr award for space exploration in 2008 launch development and missions rocket history japan launched its first satellite ohsumi in 1970 using isas l-4s rocket prior to the merger isas used small solid-fueled launch vehicles while nasda developed larger liquid-fueled launchers in the beginning nasda used licensed american models the first model of liquid-fuelled launch vehicle indigenously developed in japan was the h-ii introduced in 1994 however at the end of the 1990s with two h-ii launch failures japanese rocket technology began to face criticism early h-iia missions japans first space mission under jaxa an h-iia rocket launch on 29 november 2003 ended in failure due to stress problems after a 15-month hiatus jaxa performed a successful launch of an h-iia rocket from tanegashima space center placing a satellite into orbit on 26 february 2005 orbital ss-520 mission in january 2017 jaxa attempted and failed to put a mini satellite into orbit atop one of its ss520 series rockets a second attempt on february 2 2018 was successful putting a 10-pound cubesat into earth orbit the rocket known as the ss-520-5 is the worlds smallest orbital launcher lunar and interplanetary missions japans first missions beyond earth orbit were the 1985 halleys comet observation satellites sakigake ms-t5 and suisei planet-a to prepare for future missions isas tested earth swing by orbits with the hiten mission in 1990 the first japanese interplanetary mission was the mars orbiter nozomi planet-b which was launched in 1998 it passed mars in 2003 but failed to reach mars orbit due to maneuvering systems failures earlier in the mission currently interplanetary missions remain at the isas group under the jaxa umbrella however for fy 2008 jaxa is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization new head for this group will be hayabusa project manager kawaguchi active missions planet-c ikaros hayabusa 2 under development slim retired planet-b selene muses-c cancelled lunar-a small body exploration hayabusa mission on 9 may 2003 hayabusa meaning peregrine falcon was launched from an m-v rocket the goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small near-earth asteroid named 25143 itokawa the craft rendezvoused with the asteroid in september 2005 it was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in november 2005 after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data hayabusa returned to earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 june 2010 lunar explorations after hiten in 1990 isas planned a lunar penetrator mission called lunar-a but after delays due to technical problems the project was terminated in january 2007 the seismometer penetrator design for lunar-a may be reused in a future mission on 14 september 2007 jaxa succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer kaguya also known as selene costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle the largest such mission since the apollo program on an h-2a rocket its mission is to gather data on the moons origin and evolution it entered lunar orbit on 4 october 2007 after 1 year and 8 months it impacted the lunar surface on 10 june 2009 at 1825 utc jaxa plans to launch its first lunar surface mission slim smart lander for investigating moon on an epsilon rocket in fiscal year 2019 planetary exploration japans planetary missions have so far been limited to the inner solar system and emphasis has been put on magnetospheric and atmospheric research the mars explorer nozomi planet-b which isas launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed jaxa faced nozomi ultimately passed 1000km from the surface of mars on 20 may 2010 the venus climate orbiter akatsuki planet-c and ikaros solar sail demonstrator was launched by a h-2a launch vehicle on 7 december 2010 akatsuki was unable to complete its venus orbit insertion maneuver akatsuki finally entered venus orbit in 7 december 2015 making it the first japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of nozomi one of akatsukis main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind venus atmospheres super-rotation a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the troposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that venus itself rotates a thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found jaxaisas was part of the international laplace jupiter mission proposal from its foundation a japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research jupiters magnetosphere jmo jupiter magnetospheric orbiter although jmo never left the conception phase isas scientists will see their instruments reaching jupiter on the esa-led juice jupiter icy moon explorer mission juice is a reformulation of the esa ganymede orbiter from the laplace project jaxas contribution includes providing components of the rpwi radio plasma wave investigation pep particle environment package gala ganymede laser altimeter instruments jaxa is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the martian system a sample return mission to phobos called mmx martian moons explorer first revealed in 9 june 2015 mmxs primary goal is to determine the origin of the martian moons alongside collecting samples from phobos mmx will perform remote sensing of deimos and may also observe the atmosphere of mars as well as of january 2016 mmx is to be launched in fiscal year 2022 solar sail research on 9 august 2004 isas successfully deployed two prototype solar sails from a sounding rocket a clover type sail was deployed at 122km altitude and a fan type sail was deployed at 169km altitude both sails used 75 micrometer thick film isas tested a solar sail again as a sub payload to the akari astro-f mission on 22 february 2006 however the solar sail did not deploy fully isas tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the solar-b launch at 23 september 2006 but contact with the probe was lost the ikaros solar sail was launched on 21 may 2010 the solar sail deployed successfully the goal is to have a solar sail mission to jupiter after 2020 astronomy program the first japanese astronomy mission was x-ray satellite hakucho corsa-b which was launched in 1979 later isas moved into solar observation radio astronomy through space vlbi and infrared astronomy active missions are solar-b maxi sprint-a and calet missions under development are xrism retired missions are astro-f astro-eii and astro-h astro-g is a cancelled mission infrared astronomy japans first infrared astronomy mission was the 15cm irts telescope which was part of the sfu multipurpose satellite in 1995 irts scanned during its one-month lifetime around 7 of the sky before sfu got brought back to earth by the space shuttle during the 1990s jaxa also gave ground support for the esa infrared space observatory iso infrared mission the next step for jaxa was the akari spacecraft with the pre-launch designation astro-f this satellite was launched on 21 february 2006 its mission is infrared astronomy with a 68cm telescope this is the first all sky survey since the first infrared mission iras in 1983 a 36kg nanosatellite named cute-17 was also released from the same launch vehicle jaxa is also doing further rd for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission spica this would enable a warm launch without liquid helium spica has the same size as the esa herschel space observatory mission but is planned to have a temperature of just 45 k and will be much colder unlike akari which had a geocentric orbit spica will be located at sunearth l2 the launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on jaxas new h3 launch vehicle however the mission is not yet fully funded esa and nasa may also each contribute an instrument x-ray astronomy starting from 1979 with hakucho corsa-b for nearly two decades japan had achieved continuous observation with its hinotori tenma ginga and asca astro-a through d x-ray observation satellites however in the year 2000 the launch of japans fifth x-ray observation satellite astro-e failed as it failed at launch it never received a proper name then on 10 july 2005 jaxa was finally able to launch a new x-ray astronomy mission named suzaku astro-eii this launch was important for jaxa because in the five years since the launch failure of the original astro-e satellite japan was without an x-ray telescope three instruments were included in this satellite an x-ray spectrometer xrs an x-ray imaging spectrometer xis and a hard x-ray detector hxd however the xrs was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium the next jaxa x-ray mission is the monitor of all-sky x-ray image maxi maxi continuously monitors astronomical x-ray objects over a broad energy band 05 to 30 kev maxi is installed on the japanese external module of the iss on 17 february 2016 hitomi astro-h was launched as the successor to suzaku which completed its mission a year before solar observation japans solar astronomy started in the early 80s with the launch of the hinotori astro-a x-ray mission the hinode solar-b spacecraft the follow-on to the joint japanusuk yohkoh solar-a spacecraft was launched on 23 september 2006 a solar-c can be expected sometime after 2020 however no details are worked out yet other than it will not be launched with the former isass mu rockets instead a h-2a from tanegashima could launch it as h-2a is more powerful solar-c could either be heavier or be stationed at l1 lagrange point 1 radio astronomy in 1998 japan launched the halca muses-b mission the worlds first spacecraft dedicated to conduct space vlbi observations of pulsars among others to do so isas set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation the observation part of the mission lasted until 2003 and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005 in fy 2006 japan funded the astro-g as the succeeding mission communication positioning and technology tests one of the primary duties of the former nasda body was the testing of new space technologies mostly in the field of communication the first test satellite was ets-i launched in 1975 however during the 1990s nasda was hit by bad luck with the problems surrounding the ets-vi and comets missions in february 2018 jaxa announced a research collaboration with sony to test a laser communication system from the kibo module in late 2018 testing of communication technologies remains to be one of jaxas key duties in cooperation with nict active missions index winds qzs-1 under development slats qzs-2 qzs-3 qzs-4 ets-ix retired oicets ets-viii i-space ets-viii winds and qzs-1 to upgrade japans communication technology the japanese state launched the i-space initiative with the ets-viii and winds missions ets-viii was launched on 18 december 2006 the purpose of ets-viii is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an atomic clock test on 26 december both antennas were successfully deployed this didnt come unexpected since jaxa tested the deployment mechanism before with the ldrex-2 mission which was launched on 14 october with the european ariane 5 the test was successful the mission of winds kizuna is to create the worlds fastest satellite internet connection winds was launched in february 2008 oicets and index on 24 august 2005 jaxa launched the experimental satellites oicets and index on a ukrainian dnepr rocket oicets kirari is a mission tasked with tesing optical links with the european space agency esa artemis satellite which is around 40000km away from oicets the experiment was successful on 9 december when the link could be established in march 2006 jaxa could establish with oicets the worldwide first optical links between a leo satellite and a ground station first in japan and in june 2006 with a mobile station in germany index reimei is a small 70kg satellite for testing various equipment and functions as an aurora observation mission as well the reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase earth observation programme japans first earth observation satellites were mos-1a and mos-1b launched in 1987 and 1990 during the 1990s and the new millennium this programme came under heavy fire because both adeos midori and adeos 2 midori 2 satellites failed after just 10 months in orbit active missions gosat gcom-w alos-2 under development gcom-c gosat-2 alos-3 retired alos alos in january 2006 jaxa successfully launched the advanced land observation satellite alosdaichi communication between alos and the ground station in japan will be done through the kodama data relay satellite which was launched during 2002 this project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the adeos ii midori earth observation mission for missions following daichi jaxa opted to separate it into a radar satellite alos-2 and an optical satellite alos-3 alos 2 sar was launched in may 2014 rainfall observation since japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a very important issue for this reason japan launched in 1997 the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission satellite in cooperation with nasa to observe the tropical rainfall seasons for further research nasda had launched the adeos and adeos ii missions in 1996 and 2003 however due to various reasons both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term on 28 february 2014 a h-2a rocket launched the gpm core observatory a satellite jointly developed by jaxa and nasa the gpm mission is the successor to the trmm mission which by the time of the gpm launch had been noted as highly successful jaxa provided the global precipitation measurementdual-frequency precipitation radar gpmdpr instrument for this mission global precipitation measurement itself is a satellite constellation whilst the gpm core observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation other countriesagencies like france india esa etc provides the subsatellites the aim of gpm is to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail monitoring of carbon dioxide at the end of the 2008 fiscal year jaxa launched the satellite gosat greenhouse gas observing satellite to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the satellite is being jointly developed by jaxa and japans ministry of the environment jaxa is building the satellite while the ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the worlds atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe the gosat may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground sensors for methane and other greenhouse gasses are also being considered for the satellite although the plans are not yet finalized the satellite weighs approximately 1650kg and is expected to have a life span of 5 years gcom series next funded earth observation mission after gosat is the gcom global change observation mission earth observation programme as a successor to adeos ii midori and the aqua mission to reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites altogether gcom will be a series of six satellites the first satellite gcom-w shizuku was launched on 17 may 2012 with the h-iia the launch of the second satellite gcom-c is currently planned for 2017 satellites for other agencies for weather observation japan launched in february 2005 the multi-functional transport satellite 1r mtsat-1r the success of this launch was critical for japan since the original mtsat-1 couldnt be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the h-2 rocket in 1999 since then japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its useful life term and on american systems on 18 february 2006 jaxa as head of the h-iia at this time successfully launched the mtsat-2 aboard a h-2a rocket mtsat-2 is the backup to the mtsat-1r the mtsat-2 uses the ds-2000 satellite bus developed by mitsubishi electric the ds-2000 is also used for the drts kodama ets-viii and the superbird 7 communication satellite making it the first commercial success for japan as a secondary mission both the mtsat-1r and mtsat-2 help to direct air traffic other jaxa satellites currently in use geotail magnetosphere observation satellite since 1992 drts kodama data relay satellite since 2002 projected life span is 7 years ongoing joint missions with nasa are the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm the aqua earth observation satellite and the global precipitation measurement gpm core satellite on may 11 2018 jaxa has

to the moon 2009 and beyond on 23 february 2008 jaxa launched the wideband internetworking engineering test and demonstration satellite winds also called kizuna winds will facilitate experiments with faster internet connections the launch using h-iia launch vehicle 14 took place from the tanegashima space center on 10 september 2009 the first h-iib rocket was successfully launched delivering the htv-1 freighter to resupply the international space station in the year 2009 jaxa plans to launch the first satellite of the quasi zenith satellite system qzss a subsystem of the global positioning system gps two others are expected to follow later if successful one satellite will be in a zenith position over japan full-time the qzss mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for jaxa as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now the only exception is the igs programme which will be continued beyond 2008 however it seems japan is pressing forward now with the gcom earth observation satellites as successors to the adeos missions first launch is planned for 2010 in 2009 japan also plans to launch a new version of the igs with an improved resolution of 60cm

ssps space-based solar power prototype launch in 2020 aiming for a full power system in 2030 human space program japan has ten astronauts but has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and is not currently developing one officially a potentially manned space shuttle-spaceplane hope-x project launched by the conventional space launcher h-ii was developed for several years including test flights of hyflexorex prototypes but was postponed the simpler manned capsule fuji was proposed but not adopted projects for single-stage to orbit horizontal takeoff reusable launch vehicle and landing assts and the vertical takeoff and landing kankoh-maru also exist but have not been adopted the first japanese citizen to fly in space was toyohiro akiyama a journalist sponsored by tbs who flew on the soviet soyuz tm-11 in december 1990 he spent more than seven days in space on the mir space station in what the soviets called their first commercial spaceflight which allowed them to earn 14 million japan participates in us and international manned space programs including flights of japanese astronauts on russian soyuz spacecraft to the iss one space shuttle mission sts-47 in september 1992 was partially funded by japan this flight included jaxas first astronaut in space mamoru mohri as the payload specialist for the spacelab-j one of the european built spacelab modules this mission was also designated japan three other nasa space shuttle missions sts-123 sts-124 sts-127 in 20082009 delivered parts of the japanese built spacelab-module kibo to iss japanese plans for a manned lunar landing were in development but were shelved in early 2010 due to budget constraints in june 2014 japans science and technology ministry said it was considering a space mission to mars in a ministry paper it indicated unmanned exploration manned missions to mars and long-term settlement on the moon were objectives for which international cooperation and support was going to be sought on october 18th 2017 japanese discovery of a tunnel under the surface of the moon has led to press-release the tunnel seems to be suitable as a location for a base-of-operations of peaceful manned space missions according to jaxa supersonic aircraft development besides the h-iiab and epsilon rockets jaxa is also developing technology for a next-generation supersonic transport that could become the commercial replacement for the concorde the design goal of the project working name next generation supersonic transport is to develop a jet that can carry 300 passengers at mach 2 a subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in september and october 2005 in australia in 2015 jaxa performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of super sonic flight under the d-send program the economic success of such a project is still unclear and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from japanese aerospace companies like mitsubishi heavy industries so far reusable launch vehicles until 2003 jaxa isas conducted research on a reusable launch vehicle under the reusable vehicle testing rvt project other space agencies in japan not included into the jaxa organization is
