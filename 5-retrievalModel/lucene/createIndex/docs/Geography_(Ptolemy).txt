the geography greek gegraphik hyphgsis litgeographical guidance also known by its latin names as the geographia and the cosmographia is a gazetteer an atlas and a treatise on cartography compiling the geographical knowledge of the 2nd-century roman empire originally written by claudius ptolemy in greek at alexandria around ad150 the work was a revision of a now-lost atlas by marinus of tyre using additional roman and persian gazetteers and new principles its translation into arabic in the 9th century and latin in 1406 was highly influential on the geographical knowledge and cartographic traditions of the medieval caliphate and renaissance europe manuscripts versions of ptolemys work in antiquity were probably proper atlases with attached maps although some scholars believe that the references to maps in the text were later additions no greek manuscript of the geography survives from earlier than the 13th century a letter written by the byzantine monk maximus planudes records that he searched for one for chora monastery in the summer of 1295 one of the earliest surviving texts may have been one of those he then assembled in europe maps were sometimes redrawn using the coordinates provided by the text as planudes was forced to do later scribes and publishers could then copy these new maps as athanasius did for the emperor andronicusiipalaeologus the three earliest surviving texts with maps are those from constantinople istanbul based on planudess work the first latin translation of these texts was made in 1406 or 1407 by jacobus angelus in florence italy under the name geographia claudii ptolemaei it is not thought that his edition had maps although manuel chrysoloras had given palla strozzi a greek copy of planudess maps in florence in 1397 contents the geography consists of three sections divided among 8 books booki is a treatise on cartography describing the methods used to assemble and arrange ptolemys data from bookii through the beginning of bookvii a gazetteer provides longitude and latitude values for the world known to the ancient romans the ecumene the rest of bookvii provides details on three projections to be used for the construction of a map of the world varying in complexity and fidelity bookviii constitutes an atlas of regional maps the maps include a recapitulation of some of the values given earlier in the work which were intended to be used as captions to clarify the maps contents and maintain their accuracy during copying cartographical treatise maps based on scientific principles had been made in europe since the time of eratosthenes in the 3rdcenturybc ptolemy improved the treatment of map projections he provided instructions on how to create his maps in the first section of the work gazetteer the gazetteer section of ptolemys work provided latitude and longitude coordinates for all the places and geographical features in the work latitude was expressed in degrees of arc from the equator the same system that is used now though ptolemy used fractions of a degree rather than minutes of arc his prime meridian ran through the fortunate isles the westernmost land recorded at around the position of el hierro in the canary islands the maps spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the fortunate isles in the atlantic to china ptolemy was aware that europe knew only about a quarter of the globe atlas ptolemys work included a single large and less detailed world map and then separate and more detailed regional maps the first greek manuscripts compiled after maximus planudess rediscovery of the text had as many as 64 regional maps the standard set in western europe came to be 26 10 european maps 4 african maps and 12 asian maps as early as the 1420s these canonical maps were complemented by extra-ptolemaic regional maps depicting eg scandinavia the ptolemy world map including the countries of serica and sinae cattigara at the extreme right beyond the island of taprobane

formed the basis of ptolemys geography has been completely lost a world map based on ptolemy was displayed in augustodunum autun france in late roman times pappus writing at alexandria in the 4th century produced a commentary on ptolemys geography and used it as the basis of his now lost chorography of the ecumene later imperial writers and mathematicians however seem to have restricted themselves to commenting on ptolemys text rather than improving upon it surviving records actually show decreasing fidelity to real position whereas previous greco-roman geographers such as strabo and pliny the elder demonstrated a reluctance to rely on the contemporary accounts of sailors and merchants who plied distant areas of the indian ocean marinus and ptolemy betray a much greater receptiveness to incorporating information received from them for instance grant parker argues that it would be highly implausible for them to have constructed the bay of bengal as precisely as they did without the accounts of sailors when it comes to the account of the golden chersonese ie malay peninsula and the magnus sinus ie gulf of thailand and south china sea marinus and ptolemy relied on the testimony of a greek sailor named alexandros who claimed to have visited a far eastern site called cattigara most likely oc eo vietnam the site of unearthed antonine-era roman goods and not far from the region of jiaozhi in northern vietnam where ancient chinese sources claim several roman embassies first landed in the 2nd and 3rd centuries medieval islam muslim cartographers were using copies of ptolemys almagest and geography by the 9th century at that time in the court of the caliph al-mamm al-khwrazm compiled his book of the depiction of the earth which mimicked the geography in providing the coordinates for 545 cities and regional maps of the nile the island of the jewel the sea of darkness and the sea of azov a 1037 copy of these are the earliest extant maps from islamic lands the text clearly states that al-khwrazm was working from an earlier map although this could not have been an exact copy of ptolemys work his prime meridian was 10 east of ptolemys he adds some places and his latitudes differ ca nallino suggests that the work was not based on ptolemy but on a derivative world map presumably in syriac or arabic the colored map of al-mamm constructed by a team including al-khwrazm was described by the persian encyclopdist al-masd around 956 as superior to the maps of marinus and ptolemy probably indicating that it was built along similar mathematical principles it included 4530 cities and over 200 mountains despite beginning to compile numerous gazetteers of places and cordinates indebted to ptolemy muslim scholars made almost no direct use of ptolemys principles in the maps which have survived instead they followed al-khwrazms modifications and the orthogonal projection advocated by suhrbs early 10th-century treatise on the marvels of the seven climes to the end of habitation surviving maps from the medieval period were not done according to mathematical principles the world map from the 11th-century book of curiosities is the earliest surviving map of the muslim or christian worlds to include a graticule but the copyist seems to have not understood its purpose starting it from the left using twice the intended scale and then apparently realizing his mistake giving up halfway through its presence does strongly suggest the existence of earlier now-lost maps which had been mathematically derived in the manner of ptolemy al-khwrazmi or suhrb there are surviving reports of such maps ptolemys geography was translated from arabic into latin at the court of king roger ii of sicily in the 12th century ce however no copy of that translation has survived renaissance the greek text of the geography reached florence from constantinople in about 1400 and was translated into latin by jacobus angelus of scarperia around 1406 the first printed edition with maps published in 1477 in bologna was also be the first printed book with engraved illustrations many editions followed more often using woodcut in the early days some following traditional versions of the maps and others updating them an edition printed at ulm in 1482 was the first one printed north of the alps also in 1482 francesco berlinghieri printed the first edition in vernacular italian ptolemy had mapped the whole world from the fortunatae insulae cape verde or canary islands eastward to the eastern shore of the magnus sinus this known portion of the world was comprised within 180 degrees in his extreme east ptolemy placed serica the land of silk the sinarum situs the port of the sinae and the emporium of cattigara on the 1489 map of the world by henricus martellus which was based on ptolemys work asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape the cape of cattigara cattigara was understood by ptolemy to be a port on the sinus magnus or great gulf the actual gulf of thailand at eight and a half degrees north of the equator on the coast of cambodia which is where he located it in his canon of famous cities it was the easternmost port reached by shipping trading from the graeco-roman world to the lands of the far east in ptolemys later and more well-known geography a scribal error was made and cattigara was located at eight and a half degrees south of the equator on ptolemaic maps such as that of martellus catigara was located on the easternmost shore of the mare indicum 180 degrees east of the cape st vincent at due to the scribal error eight and a half degrees south of the equator catigara is also shown at this location on martin waldseemllers 1507 world map which avowedly followed the tradition of ptolemy ptolemys information was thereby misinterpreted so that the coast of china which should have been represented as part of the coast of eastern asia was falsely made to represent an eastern shore of the indian ocean as a result ptolemy implied more land east of the 180th meridian and an ocean beyond marco polos account of his travels in eastern asia described lands and seaports on an eastern ocean apparently unknown to ptolemy marco polos narrative authorized the extensive additions to the ptolemaic map shown on the 1492 globe of martin behaim the fact that ptolemy did not represent an eastern coast of asia made it admissible for behaim to extend that continent far to the east behaims globe placed marco polos mangi and cathay east of ptolemys 180th meridian and the great khans capital cambaluc beijing on the 41st parallel of latitude at approximately 233 degrees east behaim allowed 60 degrees beyond ptolemys 180 degrees for the mainland of asia and 30 degrees more to the east coast of cipangu japan cipangu and the mainland of asia were thus placed only 90 and 120 degrees respectively west of the canary islands the codex seragliensis was used as the base of a new edition of the work in 2006 this new edition was used to decode ptolemys coordinates of books 2 and 3 by an interdisciplinary team of tu berlin presented in publications in 2010 and 2012 influence on christopher columbus christopher columbus modified this geography further by using 53 italian nautical miles as the length of a degree instead of the longer degree of ptolemy and by adopting marinus of tyres longitude of 225 degrees for the east coast of the magnus sinus this resulted in a considerable eastward advancement of the longitudes given by martin behaim and other contemporaries of columbus by some process columbus reasoned that the longitudes of eastern asia and cipangu respectively were about 270 and 300 degrees east or 90 and 60 degrees west of the canary islands he said that he had sailed 1100 leagues from the canaries when he found cuba in 1492 this was approximately where he thought the coast of eastern asia would be found on this basis of calculation he identified hispaniola with cipangu which he had expected to find on the outward voyage at a distance of about 700 leagues from the canaries his later voyages resulted in further exploration of cuba and in the discovery of south and central america at first south america the mundus novus new world was considered to be a great island of continental proportions but as a result of his fourth voyage it was apparently considered to be identical with the great upper india peninsula india superior represented by behaimthe cape of cattigara this seems to be the best interpretation of the sketch map made by alessandro zorzi on the advice of bartholomew columbus christophers brother around 1506 which bears an inscription saying that according to the ancient geographer marinus of tyre and christopher columbus the distance from cape st vincent on the coast of portugal to cattigara on the peninsula of india superior was 225 degrees while according to ptolemy the same distance was 180 degrees early modern ottoman empire prior to the 16th century knowledge of geography in the ottoman empire was limited in scope with almost no access to the works of earlier islamic scholars that superseded ptolemy his geography would again be translated and updated with commentary into arabic under mehmed ii who commissioned works from byzantine scholar george amiroutzes in 1465 and the florentine humanist francesco berlinghieri in 1481 longitudes error and earth size there are two related errors considering a sample of 80 cities amongst the 6345 listed by ptolemy those that are both identifiable and for which we can expect a better distance measurement since they were well known there is a systematic overestimation of the longitude by a factor 1428 with a high confidence coefficient of determination r 09935 this error produces evident deformations in ptolemys world map most apparent for example in the profile of italy which is markedly stretched horizontally ptolemy accepted that the known ecumene spanned 180 of longitude but instead of accepting eratostheness estimate for the circumference of the earth of 252000 stadia he shrinks it to 180000 stadia with a factor of 14 between the two figures this suggests ptolemy rescaled his longitude data to fit with the sacred number of 180000 stadia as the circumference of the earth ptolemy rescaled experimentally obtained data in many of his works on
