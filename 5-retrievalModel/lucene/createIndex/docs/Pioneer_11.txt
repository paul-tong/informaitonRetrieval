pioneer 11 also known as pioneer g is a 259-kilogram 571lb robotic space probe launched by nasa on april 6 1973 to study the asteroid belt the environment around jupiter and saturn solar wind and cosmic rays it was the first probe to encounter saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by jupiter thereafter pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the solar system due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on september 30 1995 and the last good engineering data was received on november 24 1995 mission background history approved in february 1969 pioneer 11 and its twin probe pioneer 10 were the first to be designed for exploring the outer solar system yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s early mission objectives were defined as explore the interplanetary medium beyond the orbit of mars investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belts possible hazard to missions to the outer planets explore the environment of jupiter subsequent planning for an encounter with saturn added many more goals map the magnetic field of saturn and determine its intensity direction and structure determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the saturn system map the interaction of the saturn system with the solar wind measure the temperature of saturns atmosphere and that of titan the largest satellite of saturn determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere map the thermal structure of saturns atmosphere by infrared observations coupled with radio occultation data obtain spin-scan images of the saturnian system in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet probe the ring system and the atmosphere of saturn with s-band radio occultation determine more precisely the masses of saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft as a precursor to the mariner jupitersaturn mission verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the mariner spacecraft without serious damage pioneer 11 was built by trw and managed as part of the pioneer program by nasa ames research center a backup unit pioneer h is currently on display in the milestones of flight exhibit at the national air and space museum in washington dc many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the voyager program spacecraft design the pioneer 11 bus measured 36 centimeters 14in deep and with six 76-centimeter-long 30in panels forming the hexagonal structure the bus housed propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the twelve scientific instruments the spacecraft had a mass of 260 kilograms attitude control and propulsion communications power computer scientific instruments pioneer had one additional instrument more than pioneer 10 a flux-gate magnetometer mission profile launch and trajectory the pioneer 11 probe was launched on april 6 1973 at 021100 utc by the national aeronautics and space administration from space launch complex 36a at cape canaveral florida aboard an atlas-centaur launch vehicle its twin probe pioneer 10 had launched a year earlier on march 3 1972 pioneer 11 was launched on a trajectory directly aimed at jupiter without any prior gravitational assists in may 1974 pioneer was retargeted to fly past jupiter on a north-south trajectory enabling a saturn flyby in 1979 the maneuver used 17 pounds of propellant lasted 42 minutes and 36 seconds and increased pioneer 11s speed by 230kmh it also made two mid-course corrections on april 11 1973 and november 7 1974 encounter with jupiter pioneer 11 flew past jupiter in november and december 1974 during its closest approach on december 2 it passed 42828 kilometers 26612mi above the cloud tops the probe obtained detailed images of the great red spot transmitted the first images of the immense polar regions and determined the mass of jupiters moon callisto using the gravitational pull of jupiter a gravity assist was used to alter the trajectory of the probe towards saturn on april 16 1975 following the jupiter encounter the micrometer detector was turned off pioneer 11 jupiter encounter pioneer 11

cloud tops by this time voyager 1 and voyager 2 had already passed jupiter and were also en route to saturn so it was decided to target pioneer 11 to pass through the saturn ring plane at the same position that the soon-to-come voyager probes would use in order to test the route before the voyagers arrived if there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via pioneer thus pioneer 11 was acting as a pioneer in a true sense of the word if danger were detected then the voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings but missing the opportunity to visit uranus and neptune in the process pioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of saturns small moons passing at a distance of no more than 4000 kilometers 2500mi the object was tentatively identified as epimetheus a moon discovered the previous day from pioneers imaging and suspected from earlier observations by earth-based telescopes after the voyager flybys it became known that there are two similarly-sized moons epimetheus and janus in the same orbit so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of pioneers near-miss pioneer 11 encountered janus on september 1 1979 at 1452 utc at a distance of 2500km and mimas at 1620 utc the same day at 103000km besides epimetheus instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring charted saturns magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon titan to be too cold for life hurtling underneath the ring plane the probe sent back pictures of saturns rings the rings which normally seem bright when observed from earth appeared dark in the pioneer pictures and the dark gaps in the rings seen from earth appeared as bright rings pioneer 11 image of saturn taken on 19790826 pioneer 11 image of saturn taken on 19790826 pioneer 11 image of saturn taken on 19790901 pioneer 11 image of saturn taken on 19790901 pioneer

operations by 1995 pioneer 11 could no longer power any of its detectors so the decision was made to shut it down on september 29 1995 nasas ames research center responsible for managing the project issued a press release that began after nearly 22 years of exploration out to the farthest reaches of the solar system one of the most durable and productive space missions in history will come to a close it indicated nasa would use its deep space network antennas to listen once or twice a month for the spacecrafts signal until some time in late 1996 when its transmitter will fall silent altogether nasa administrator daniel goldin characterized pioneer 11 as the little spacecraft that could a venerable explorer that has taught us a great deal about the solar system and in the end about our own innate drive to learn pioneer 11 is what nasa is all about exploration beyond the frontier besides announcing the end of operations the dispatch provided a historical list of pioneer 11 mission achievements nasa terminated routine contact with the spacecraft on september 30 1995 but continued to make contact for about 2 hours every 2 to 4 weeks scientists received a few minutes of good engineering data on 24 november 1995 but then lost final contact once earth permanently moved out of view of the spacecrafts antenna its signal became too faint to hear in 2002 current status on january 30 2019 pioneer 11 was 10084au 1508510km 937410mi from the earth and 100au 1510km 9310mi from the sun and traveling at 11241kms 40470kmh 25150mph relative to the sun and traveling outward at about 237 au per year the spacecraft is heading in the direction of the constellation scutum near the current position august 2017 ra 18h 50m dec -8 395 j20000 close to messier 26 pioneer 11 has now been overtaken by the two voyager probes launched in 1977 and voyager 1 is now the most distant object built by humans pioneer anomaly analysis of the radio tracking data from the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at distances between 2070 au from the sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous doppler frequency drift the drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of 874 133 10 ms directed towards the sun although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect none was found as a result there is sustained interest in the nature of this so-called pioneer anomaly extended analysis of mission data by slava turyshev and colleagues has determined the source of the anomaly to be asymmetric thermal radiation and the resulting thermal recoil force acting on the face of the pioneers away from the sun and in july 2012 the group of researchers published their results in the physical review letters scientific journal pioneer plaque pioneer 10 and 11 both carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent lifeforms from other planetary systems the plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft commemoration in 1991 pioneer 11 was honored on one of 10
