mariner 4 together with mariner 3 known as marinermars 1964 was the fourth in a series of spacecraft intended for planetary exploration in a flyby mode it was designed to conduct closeup scientific observations of mars and to transmit these observations to earth launched on november 28 1964 mariner 4 performed the first successful flyby of the planet mars returning the first close-up pictures of the martian surface it captured the first images of another planet ever returned from deep space their depiction of a cratered seemingly dead world largely changed the scientific communitys view of life on mars other mission objectives were to perform field and particle measurements in interplanetary space in the vicinity of mars and to provide experience in and knowledge of the engineering capabilities for interplanetary flights of long duration on december 21 1967 communications with mariner 4 were terminated spacecraft and subsystems the mariner 4 spacecraft consisted of an octagonal magnesium frame 127cm across a diagonal and 457cm high four solar panels were attached to the top of the frame with an end-to-end span of 688 meters including solar pressure vanes which extended from the ends a 1168cm diameter high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted at the top of the frame as well an omnidirectional low-gain antenna was mounted on a seven-foot four inch 2235cm tall mast next to the high-gain antenna the overall height of the spacecraft was 289 meters the octagonal frame housed the electronic equipment cabling midcourse propulsion system and attitude control gas supplies and regulators the scientific instruments included a helium magnetometer mounted on the waveguide leading to the omnidirectional antenna to measure the magnitude and other characteristics of the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields an ionization chambergeiger counter mounted on the waveguide leading to the omnidirectional antenna nearer the body of the spacecraft to measure the charged-particle intensity and distribution in interplanetary space and in the vicinity of mars a trapped radiation detector mounted on the body with counter-axes pointing 70 and 135 from the solar direction to measure the intensity and direction of low-energy particles a cosmic ray telescope mounted inside the body pointing in anti-solar direction to measure the direction and energy spectrum of protons and alpha particles a solar plasma probe mounted on the body pointing 10 from the solar direction to measure the very low energy charged particle flux from the sun a cosmic dust detector mounted on the body with microphone plate approximately perpendicular to the plane of orbit to measure the momentum distribution density and direction of cosmic dust a television camera mounted on a scan platform at the bottom center of the spacecraft to obtain closeup pictures of the surface of mars this subsystem consisted of 4 parts a cassegrain telescope with a 105 by 105 field of view a shutter and redgreen filter assembly with 008s and 020s exposure times a slow scan vidicon tube which translated the optical image into an electrical video signal and the electronic systems required to convert the analogue signal into a digital bitstream for transmission the electric power for the instruments and the radio transmitter of mariner 4 was supplied by 28224 solar cells contained in the four 176 x 90cm solar panels which could provide 310 watts at the distance of mars a rechargeable 1200 wh silver-zinc battery was also used for maneuvers and backup monopropellant hydrazine was used for propulsion via a four-jet vane vector control motor with 222-newton 50lbf thrust installed on one of the sides of the octagonal structure the space probes attitude control was provided by 12 cold nitrogen gas jets mounted on the ends of the solar panels and three gyros solar pressure vanes each with an area of 065 square meter sevenft were attached to the tips of the solar panels positional information was provided by four sun sensors and a sensor for either the earth mars or the star canopus depending on the time in its spaceflight mariner 4 was the first space probe that needed a star for a navigational reference object since earlier missions which remained near either the earth the moon or the planet venus had sighted onto either the bright face of the home planet or the brightly lit target during this flight both the earth and mars would be too dim to lock onto another bright source at a wide angle away from the sun was needed and canopus filled this requirement subsequently canopus was used as a reference point in many following missions the telecommunications equipment on mariner 4 consisted of dual s-band transmitters with either a seven-watt triode cavity amplifier or a ten watt traveling-wave tube amplifier and a single radio receiver which together could send and receive data via the low- and high-gain antennas at 8 or 33 bits per second data could also be stored onto a magnetic tape recorder with a capacity of 524 million bits for later transmission all electronic operations were controlled by a command subsystem which could process any of 29 direct command words or three quantitative word commands for mid-course maneuvers the central computer and sequencer operated stored time-sequence commands using a 384khz synchronization frequency as a time reference temperature control was achieved through the use of adjustable louvers mounted on six of the electronics assemblies plus multilayer insulating blankets polished aluminum shields and surface treatments other measurements that could be made included radio occultation celestial mechanics based on precision tracking mission profile launch after mariner 3 was a total loss due to failure of the payload shroud to jettison jpl engineers suggested that there had been a malfunction caused during separation of the metal fairing exterior from the fiberglass inner lining due to pressure differences between the inner and outer part of the shroud and that this could have caused the spring-loaded separation mechanism to become tangled and fail to detach properly testing at jpl confirmed this failure mode and an effort was made to develop a new all-metal fairing the downside of this was that the new fairing would be significantly heavier and reduce the atlas-agenas lift capacity convair and lockheed-martin had to make several performance enhancements to the booster to wring more power out of it despite fears that the work could not be completed before the 1964 mars window closed the new shroud was ready by november after launch from cape canaveral air force station launch complex 12 the protective shroud covering mariner 4 was jettisoned and the agena-dmariner 4 combination separated from the atlas-d booster at 142723 utc on november 28 1964 the agenas first burn took place from 142814 to 143038 the initial burn put the spacecraft into an earth parking orbit and the second burn from 150253 to 150428 injected the craft into a mars transfer orbit mariner 4 separated from the agena at 150709 and began cruise mode operations the solar panels deployed and the scan platform was unlatched at 151500 sun acquisition occurred 16 minutes later lock on canopus after sun acquisition the canopus star tracker went searching for canopus the star tracker was set to respond to any object more than one-eighth as and less than eight times as bright as canopus including canopus there were seven such objects visible to the sensor it took more than a day of star-hopping to find canopus as the sensor locked on to other stars instead a stray light pattern from the near earth alderamin regulus naos and gamma velorum were acquired before canopus a consistent problem that plagued the spacecraft during the early portion of its mission was that roll error signal transients would occur frequently and on occasion would cause loss of the canopus star lock the first attempt at a midcourse maneuver was aborted by a loss of lock shortly after the gyros began spinup canopus lock was lost six times within a period of less than three weeks after launch and each time a sequence of radio commands would be required to reacquire the star after a study of the problem the investigators concluded that the behavior was due to small dust particles that were being released from the spacecraft by some means and were drifting through the star sensor field-of-view sunlight scattered from the particles then appeared as illumination equivalent to that from a bright star this would cause a roll error transient as the object passed through the field-of-view while the sensor was locked onto canopus when the object was bright enough that it exceeded the high gate limits at eight times the canopus intensity the spacecraft would automatically disacquire canopus and initiate a roll search for a new star finally a radio command was sent on december 17 1964 that removed the high gate limit there was no further loss of canopus lock although roll transients occurred 38 more times before encounter with mars midcourse maneuver the 7 month flight of mariner 4 involved one midcourse maneuver on december 5 1964 the maneuver was initially scheduled for december 4 but due to a loss of lock with canopus it was postponed the maneuver was successfully completed on december 5 it consisted of a negative pitch turn of 3916 degrees a positive roll turn of 15608 degrees and a thrusting time of 2007 seconds the turns aimed the motor of the spacecraft back in the general direction of earth as the motor was initially pointed along the direction of flight both the pitch and roll changes were completed with better than 1 accuracy the velocity change with about 25 accuracy after the maneuver mariner 4 was on course for mars as planned mars flyby the mariner4 spacecraft flew by mars on july 14 and july 15 1965 its closest approach was 9846km from the martian surface at 010057 ut july 15 1965 80057pm est july 14 its distance to earth was 216gm its speed was 7kms relative to mars 17kms relative to earth planetary science mode was turned on at 154149 ut on july 14 the camera sequence started at 001836 ut on july 15 71849pm est on july 14 and 21 pictures using alternate red and green filters plus 21 lines of a 22nd picture were taken the images covered a discontinuous swath of mars starting near 40 n 170 e down to about 35 s 200 e and then across to the terminator at 50 s 255 e representing about 1 of the planets surface the images taken during the flyby were stored in the on-board tape recorder at 021911 ut mariner 4 passed behind mars as seen from earth and the radio signal ceased the signal was reacquired at 031304 ut when the spacecraft reappeared cruise mode was then re-established transmission of the taped images to earth began about 85 hours after signal reacquisition and continued until august 3 all images were transmitted twice to ensure no data was missing or corrupt each individual photograph took approximately six hours to be transmitted back to earth the spacecraft performed all programmed activities successfully and returned useful data from launch until 220507 ut on october 1 1965 when the long distance to earth 3092 million km and the imprecise antenna orientation led to a temporary loss of communication with the spacecraft until 1967 first image hand drawn the on-board tape recorder used on mariner 4 was a spare not originally intended for the mariner 4 flight between the failure of mariner 3 the fact that the mariner 4 recorder was a spare and some error readings suggesting an issue with the tape-recorder it was determined that the team would test the camera function definitively this eventually led to the first digital image being hand-drawn while waiting for the image data to be computer processed the team used a pastel set from an art supply store to hand-color paint-by-numbers style a numerical printout of the raw pixels the resulting image provided early verification that the camera was functioning the hand-drawn image compared favorably with the processed image when it became available micrometeoroid hits and end of communications data acquisition resumed in late 1967 the cosmic dust detector registered 17 hits in a 15-minute span on september 15 part of an apparent micrometeoroid shower that temporarily changed the spacecraft attitude and probably slightly damaged its thermal shield later it was speculated that mariner 4 passed through debris of d1895 q1 dswift and even made a flyby of that comets possibly shattered nucleus at 20 million kilometers on december 7 the gas supply in the attitude control system was exhausted and between december 10 and 11 a total of 83 micrometeoroid hits were recorded which caused perturbation of the spacecrafts attitude and degradation of the signal strength on december 21 1967 communications with mariner 4 were terminated the spacecraft is now derelict in an exterior heliocentric orbit results the total data returned by the mission was 52 million bits about 634 kb all instruments operated successfully with the exception of a part of the ionization chamber namely the geigermller tube which failed in february 1965 in addition the plasma probe had its performance degraded by a resistor failure on december 8 1964 but experimenters were able to recalibrate the instrument and still interpret the data the images returned showed a moon-like cratered terrain which scientists did not expect although amateur astronomer donald cyr had predicted craters later missions showed that the craters were not typical for mars but only for the more ancient region imaged by mariner 4 a surface atmospheric pressure of 41 to 70 millibars 410 to 700 pascals and daytime temperatures of 100 degrees celsius were estimated no magnetic field or martian radiation belts or again surprisingly surface water was detected bruce

on mars had been the subject of speculation and science fiction for centuries if there was life on mars after mariner 4 most concluded it would probably be smaller simpler forms others concluded that a search for life on earth at kilometer resolution using several thousand photographs did not reveal a sign of life on the vast majority of these photographs thus based on the 22 photographs taken by mariner 4 one could not conclude there was no intelligent life on mars the solar wind was measured and compared with simultaneous records from mariner 5 which went to venus the total cost of the mariner 4 mission is estimated at 832 million total research development launch and support costs for the mariner series of spacecraft mariners 1 through 10 was approximately 554 million see also
