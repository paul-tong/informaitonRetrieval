in astronomy the interstellar medium ism is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy this matter includes gas in ionic atomic and molecular form as well as dust and cosmic rays it fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic space the energy that occupies the same volume in the form of electromagnetic radiation is the interstellar radiation field the interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic atomic or molecular and the temperature and density of the matter the interstellar medium is composed primarily of hydrogen followed by helium with trace amounts of carbon oxygen and nitrogen comparatively to hydrogen the thermal pressures of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another magnetic fields and turbulent motions also provide pressure in the ism and are typically more important dynamically than the thermal pressure is in all phases the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards in cool dense regions of the ism matter is primarily in molecular form and reaches number densities of 10 molecules per cm 1 million molecules per cm in hot diffuse regions of the ism matter is primarily ionized and the density may be as low as 10 ions per cm compare this with a number density of roughly 10 molecules per cm for air at sea level and 10 molecules per cm 10 billion molecules per cm for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber by mass 99 of the ism is gas in any form and 1 is dust of the gas in the ism by number 91 of atoms are hydrogen and 89 are helium with 01 being atoms of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium known as metals in astronomical parlance by mass this amounts to 70 hydrogen 28 helium and 15 heavier elements the hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of primordial nucleosynthesis while the heavier elements in the ism are mostly a result of enrichment in the process of stellar evolution the ism plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales stars form within the densest regions of the ism which ultimately contributes to molecular clouds and replenishes the ism with matter and energy through planetary nebulae stellar winds and supernovae this interplay between stars and the ism helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content and therefore its lifespan of active star formation voyager 1 reached the ism on august 25 2012 making it the first artificial object from earth to do so interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the missions end in 2025 its twin voyager 2 entered the ism in november 2018 interstellar matter table 1 shows a breakdown of the properties of the components of the ism of the milky way the three-phase model field goldsmith habing 1969 put forward the static two phase equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ism their modeled ism consisted of a cold dense phase t300k consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen and a warm intercloud phase t10k consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas mckee ostriker 1977 added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot t10k gas which had been shock heated by supernovae and constituted most of the volume of the ism these phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades however the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known the atomic hydrogen model this model takes into account only atomic hydrogen temperature larger than 3000 k breaks molecules lower than 50 000 k leaves atoms in their ground state it is assumed that influence of other atoms he is negligible pressure is assumed very low so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than the 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary temporally incoherent light in this collisionless gas einsteins theory of coherent light-matter interactions applies all gas-light interactions are spatially coherent suppose that a monochromatic light is pulsed then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole raman resonance frequency if length of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants lamb 1971 an impulsive stimulated raman scattering isrs yan gamble nelson 1985 works while light generated by incoherent raman at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light thus generates a new spectral line coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference into a single frequency thus shifts incident frequency assume that a star radiates a continuous light spectrum up to x rays lyman frequencies are absorbed in this light and pump atoms mainly to first excited state in this state hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns so that an isrs may redshift light frequency populating high hyperfine levels an other isrs may transfer energy from hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves so that redshift is permanent temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by plancks formula as entropy must increase may becomes does however where a previously absorbed line first lyman beta reaches lyman alpha frequency redshifting process stops and all hydrogen lines are strongly absorbed but the stop is not perfect if there is energy at frequency shifted to lyman beta frequency which produces a slow redshift successive redshifts separated by lyman absorptions generate many absorption lines frequencies of which deduced from absorption process obey a law more dependable than karlssons formula the previous process excites more and more atoms because a de-excitation obeys einsteins law of coherent interactions variation di of radiance i of a light beam along a path dx is dibidx where b is einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium i is the modulus of poynting vector of field absorption occurs for an opposed vector which corresponds to a change of sign of b factor i in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones competition of modes emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance i provided by random zero point field after emission of a flare weak b increases by pumping while i remains close to zero de-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field as observed close to quasars and in polar auroras structures the ism is turbulent and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales stars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds typically a few parsecs in size during their lives and deaths stars interact physically with the ism stellar winds from young clusters of stars often with giant or supergiant hii regions surrounding them and shock waves created by supernovae inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings which leads to hypersonic turbulence the resultant structures of varying sizes can be observed such as stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas seen by x-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in radio telescope maps the sun is currently traveling through the local interstellar cloud a denser region in the low-density local bubble interaction with interplanetary medium the interstellar medium begins where the interplanetary medium of the solar system ends the solar wind slows to subsonic velocities at the termination shock 90100 astronomical units from the sun in the region beyond the termination shock called the heliosheath interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind voyager 1 the farthest human-made object from the earth after 1998 crossed the termination shock december 16 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the heliopause on august 25 2012 providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ism stone et al 2005 interstellar extinction the ism is also responsible for extinction and reddening the decreasing light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelengths of light from a star these effects are caused by scattering and absorption of photons and allow the ism to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky the apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the milky way a uniform disk of stars are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from earth far ultraviolet light is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ism for example a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 1215 nanometers the lyman-alpha transition therefore it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from earth because most of it is absorbed during the trip to earth by intervening neutral hydrogen heating and cooling the ism is usually far from thermodynamic equilibrium collisions establish a maxwellboltzmann distribution of velocities and the temperature normally used to describe interstellar gas is the kinetic temperature which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed maxwellboltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium however the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium it is most often roughly that of an a star surface temperature of 10000 k highly diluted therefore bound levels within an atom or molecule in the ism are rarely populated according to the boltzmann formula spitzer 1978 24 depending on the temperature density and ionization state of a portion of the ism different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the gas heating mechanisms grain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high gas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds especially at high densities far infrared radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas a measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient where t is the gas temperature td the dust temperature and t2 the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule this coefficient was measured by burke hollenbach 1983 as 035 gravitational collapse of a cloud supernova explosions stellar winds expansion of hii regions magnetohydrodynamic waves created by supernova remnants cooling mechanisms radiowave propagation radio waves from 10khz very low frequency to 300ghz extremely high frequency propagate differently in interstellar space than on the earths surface there are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on earth a great deal of radio astronomy depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired signal history of knowledge of interstellar space the nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of astronomers and scientists over the centuries and understanding of the ism has developed however they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of interstellar space the term appears to have been first used in print by bacon 1626 3545 the interstellar skie hath so much affinity with the starre that there is a rotation of that as well as of the starre later natural philosopher robert boyle1674 discussed the inter-stellar part of heaven which several of the modern epicureans would have to be empty before modern electromagnetic theory early physicists postulated that an invisible luminiferous aether existed as a medium to carry lightwaves it was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space as patterson 1862 wrote this efflux occasions a thrill or vibratory motion in the ether which fills the interstellar spaces the advent of deep photographic imaging allowed edward barnard to produce the first images of dark nebulae silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by johannes hartmann in 1904 through the use of absorption line spectroscopy in his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of delta orionis hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the earth hartmann reported that absorption from the k line of calcium appeared extraordinarily weak but almost perfectly sharp and also reported the quite surprising result that the calcium line at 3934nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the spectroscopic binary star the stationary nature of the line led hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of delta orionis but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star this discovery launched the study of the interstellar medium in the series of investigations viktor ambartsumian introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds following hartmanns identification of interstellar calcium absorption interstellar sodium was detected by heger 1919 through the observation of stationary absorption from the atoms d lines at 5890 and 5896 nanometres towards delta orionis and beta scorpii subsequent observations of the h and k lines of calcium by beals 1936 revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of epsilon and zeta orionis these were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards orion asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines each corresponding to the same atomic transition for example the k line of calcium but occurring in interstellar clouds with different radial velocities because each cloud has a different velocity either towards or away from the observerearth the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either blue-shifted or red-shifted respectively from the lines rest wavelength through the doppler effect these observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ism the growing evidence for interstellar material led pickering 1912 to comment that while the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether yet the character of its selective absorption as indicated by kapteyn is characteristic of a gas and free gaseous molecules are certainly there since they are probably constantly being expelled by the sun and stars the same year victor hesss discovery of cosmic rays highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the earth from space led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space the following year the norwegian explorer and physicist kristian birkeland wrote it seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds we have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space it does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found not in the solar systems or nebulae but in empty space birkeland 1913 thorndike 1930 noted that it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles emitted by the sun if the millions of other stars are also ejecting ions as is undoubtedly true no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy in september 2012 nasa scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs subjected to interstellar medium ism conditions are transformed through hydrogenation oxygenation and hydroxylation to more complex organics a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides the raw materials of proteins and dna respectively further as a result of these transformations the pahs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons for the lack of pah detection in interstellar ice grains particularly the outer regions of cold dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks in february 2014 nasa announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the universe according to scientists more than 20 of the carbon in the universe may be associated with pahs possible starting materials for the formation of life pahs seem to have been formed shortly after the big bang are widespread throughout the universe and are associated
