a space habitat also called a space colony space settlement orbital habitat orbital settlement or orbital colony is a type of space station intended as a permanent settlement rather than as a simple way-station or other specialized facility no space habitat has been constructed yet but many design concepts with varying degrees of realism have come both from engineers and from science-fiction authors the term space habitat sometimes includes more broadly colonies built on or in a body other than earth - such as the moon mars or an asteroid this article concentrates on self-contained structures envisaged for micro-g environments motivation several motivations for building space colonies have been proposed survival of human civilization and the biosphere in case of a disaster on the earth natural or man-made huge resources in space for expansion of human society expansion without any ecosystems to destroy or indigenous peoples to displace it could help the earth by relieving population pressure and taking industry off-earth see reasons for space colonization or space and survival advantages a number of arguments are made for space habitats having a number of advantages access to solar energy space has an abundance of light produced from the sun in earth orbit this amounts to 1400 watts of power per square meter this energy can be used to produce electricity from solar cells or heat engine based power stations process ores provide light for plants to grow and to warm space colonies outside gravity well earth-to-space habitat trade would be easier than earth-to-planetary colony trade as colonies orbiting earth will not have a gravity well to overcome to export to earth and a smaller gravity well to overcome to import from earth in-situ resource utilization space habitats may be supplied with resources from extraterrestrial places like mars asteroids or the moon in-situ resource utilization isru see asteroid mining one could produce breathing oxygen drinking water and rocket fuel with the help of isru it may become possible to manufacture solar panels from lunar materials asteroids and other small bodies most asteroids have a mixture of materials that could be mined and because these bodies do not have substantial gravity wells it would require low delta-v to draw materials from them and haul them to a construction site there is estimated to be enough material in the main asteroid belt alone to build enough space habitats to equal the habitable surface area of 3000 earths population a 1974 estimate assumed that collection of all the material in the main asteroid belt would allow habitats may be constructed to give an immense total population capacity using the free-floating resources of the solar system this estimate extended into the trillions zero g recreation if a large area at the rotation axis is enclosed various zero-g sports are possible including swimming hang gliding and the use of human-powered aircraft passenger compartment a space habitat can be the passenger compartment of a large spacecraft for colonizing asteroids moons and planets it can also function as one for a generation ship for travel to other planets see space and survival or distant stars l r shepherd described a generation starship in 1952 comparing it to a small planet with many people living in it requirements the requirements for a space habitat are many they would have to provide all the material needs for hundreds or thousands of humans in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life atmosphere air pressure with normal partial pressures of oxygen21 carbon dioxide and nitrogen78 is a basic requirement of any space habitat basically most space colony designs concepts envision large thin-walled pressure vessels the required oxygen could be obtained from lunar rock nitrogen is most easily available from the earth but is also recycled nearly perfectly also nitrogen in the form of ammonia nh 3 may be obtainable from comets and the moons of outer planets nitrogen may also be available in unknown quantities on certain other bodies in the outer solar system the air of a colony could be recycled in a number of ways one concept is to use photosynthetic gardens possibly via hydroponics or forest gardening however these do not remove certain industrial pollutants such as volatile oils and excess simple molecular gases the standard method used on nuclear submarines a similar form of closed environment is to use a catalytic burner which effectively decomposes most organics further protection might be provided by a small cryogenic distillation system which would gradually remove impurities such as mercury vapor and noble gases that cannot be catalytically burned food production organic materials for food production would also need to be provided at first most of these would have to be imported from earth after that feces recycling should reduce the need for imports one proposed recycling method would start by burning the cryogenic distillate plants garbage and sewage with air in an electric arc and distilling the result the resulting carbon dioxide and water would be immediately usable in agriculture the nitrates and salts in the ash could be dissolved in water and separated into pure minerals most of the nitrates potassium and sodium salts would recycle as fertilizers other minerals containing iron nickel and silicon could be chemically purified in batches and reused industrially the small fraction of remaining materials well below 001 by weight could be processed into pure elements with zero-gravity mass spectrometry and added in appropriate amounts to the fertilizers and industrial stocks it is likely that methods would be greatly refined as people began to actually live in space habitats artificial gravity long-term on-orbit studies have proven that zero gravity weakens bones and muscles and upsets calcium metabolism and immune systems most people have a continual stuffy nose or sinus problems and a few people have dramatic incurable motion sickness most colony designs would rotate in order to use inertial forces to simulate gravity nasa studies with chickens and plants have proven that this is an effective physiological substitute for gravity turning ones head rapidly in such an environment causes a tilt to be sensed as ones inner ears move at different rotational rates centrifuge studies show that people get motion-sick in habitats with a rotational radius of less than 100 metres or with a rotation rate above 3 rotations per minute however the same studies and statistical inference indicate that almost all people should be able to live comfortably in habitats with a rotational radius larger than 500 meters and below 1 rpm experienced persons were not merely more resistant to motion sickness but could also use the effect to determine spinward and antispinward directions in the centrifuges protection from radiation some very large space habitat designs could be effectively shielded from cosmic rays by their structure and air smaller habitats could be shielded by stationary nonrotating bags of rock sunlight could be admitted indirectly via mirrors in radiation-proof louvres which would function in the same manner as a periscope heat rejection the colony is in a vacuum and therefore resembles a giant thermos bottle habitats also need a radiator to eliminate heat from absorbed sunlight very small habitats might have a central vane that rotates with the colony in this design convection would raise hot air up toward the center and cool air would fall down into the outer habitat some other designs would distribute coolants such as chilled water from a central radiator meteoroids and dust the habitat would need to withstand potential impacts from space debris meteoroids dustetc most meteoroids that strike the earth vaporize in the atmosphere without a thick protective atmosphere meteoroid strikes would pose a much greater risk to a space habitat radar will sweep the space around each habitat mapping the trajectory of debris and other man-made objects and allowing corrective actions to be taken to protect the habitat in some designs oneillnasa ames stanford torus and crystal palace in a hatbox habitat designs have a non-rotating cosmic ray shield of packed sand 19m thick or even artificial aggregate rock 17m ersatz concrete other proposals use the rock as structure and integral shielding oneill the high frontier sheppard concrete space colonies spaceflight journal of the bis in any of these cases strong meteoroid protection is implied by the external radiation shell 45tonnes of rock material per square meter suggestions have been made to layer such protections around a habitat multiple thicknesses up to such protection to equal an earth city which after all is completely vulnerable to total obliteration at any second without notice under the open sky a small rock such as hit near chelyabinsk in 2013 being too numerous and hard to detect for any mitigation scenario or advance warning with such a shell mass of a colony goes up sharply but it is only dumb structure -possibly non-rotating and rock-dust as industrial slag is a free left-over from processing regolith for metals or volatiles extraction note that solar power satellites are proposed in the multi-gw ranges and such energies and technologies would allow constant radar mapping of nearby 3d space out-to arbitrarily far away limited only by effort expended to do so proposals are available to move even kilometer-sized neos to high earth orbits and reaction engines for such purposes would move a space colony and any arbitrarily large shield but not in any timely or rapid manner the thrust being very low compared to the huge mass attitude control most mirror geometries require something on the habitat to be aimed at the sun and so attitude control is necessary the original oneill design used the two cylinders as momentum wheels to roll the colony and pushed the sunward pivots together or apart to use precession to change their angle considerations initial capital outlay even the smallest of the habitat designs mentioned below are more massive than the total mass of all items that humans have ever launched into earth orbit combined prerequisites to building habitats are either cheaper launch costs or a mining and manufacturing base on the moon or other body having low delta-v from the desired habitat location location the optimal habitat orbits are still debated and so orbital stationkeeping is probably a commercial issue the lunar l4 and l5 orbits are now thought to be too far away from the moon and earth a more modern proposal is to use a two-to-one resonance orbit that alternately has a close low-energy cheap approach to the moon and then to the earth this provides quick inexpensive access to both raw materials and the major market most colony designs plan to use electromagnetic tether propulsion or mass drivers used as rocket motors the advantage of these is that they either use no reaction mass at all or use cheap reaction mass conceptual studies oneill - the high frontier around 1970 near the end of project apollo 1961-1972 gerard k oneill an experimental physicist at princeton university was looking for a topic to tempt his physics students most of them freshmen in engineering he hit upon the idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats to his surprise the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes cylinders 8km 5mi in diameter and 32km 20mi long even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass also the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays almost free in the larger sizes getting naturalistic sun angles provision of power realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors oneill published an article about these colony concepts in physics today in 1974 see the above illustration of such a colony a classic oneill colony he expanded the article in his 1976 book the high frontier human colonies in space nasa amesstanford 1975 summer study the result motivated nasa to sponsor a couple of summer workshops led by oneill several concepts were studied with sizes ranging from 1000 to 10000000 people including versions of the stanford torus three concepts were presented to nasa the bernal sphere the toroidal colony and the cylindrical colony oneills concepts had an example of a payback scheme construction of solar power satellites from lunar materials oneill did not emphasize the building of solar power satellites as such but rather offered proof that orbital manufacturing from lunar materials could generate profits he and other participants presumed that once such manufacturing facilities had started production many profitable uses for them would be found and the colony would become self-supporting and begin to build other colonies as well the concept studies generated a notable groundswell of public interest one effect of this expansion was the founding of the l5society in theus a group of enthusiasts that desired to build and live in such colonies the group was named after the space-colony orbit which was then believed to be the most profitable a kidney-shaped orbit around either of earths lunar lagrange points 5 or4 space studies institute in 1977 oneill founded the space studies institute which initially funded and constructed some prototypes of the new hardware needed for a space colonization effort as well as producing a number of feasibility studies one of the early projects for instance involved a series of functional prototypes of a mass driver the essential technology for moving ores efficiently from the moon to space colony orbits nasa concepts some nasa concept studies included island one a bernal sphere habitat for about 10000 - 20000 people stanford torus an alternative to island one oneill cylinder island three an even larger design 32 km radius and 32 km long lewis one a cylinder of radius 250m with a non rotating radiation shielding the shielding protects the micro-gravity industrial space too the rotating part is 450m long and has several inner cylinders some of them are used for agriculture kalpana one revised a short cylinder with 250 m radius and 325 m length the radiation shielding is 10 tm and rotates it has several inner cylinders for agriculture and recreaction it is sized for 3000 residents a bola a spacecraft or habitat connected by a cable to a counterweight or other habitat this design has been proposed as a mars ship initial construction shack for a space habitat and orbital hotel it has a comfortably long and slow rotational radius for a relatively small station mass also if some of the equipment can form the counter-weight the equipment dedicated to artificial gravity is just a cable and thus has a much smaller mass-fraction than in other concepts for a long-term habitation however radiation shielding must rotate with the habitat and is extremely heavy thus requiring a much stronger and heavier cable beaded habitats this speculative design was also considered by the nasa studies small habitats would be mass-produced to standards that allow the habitats to interconnect a single habitat can operate alone as a bola however further habitats can be attached to grow into a dumbbell then a bow-tie then a ring then a cylinder of beads and finally a framed array of cylinders each stage of growth shares more radiation shielding and capital equipment increasing redundancy and safety while reducing the cost per person this concept was originally proposed by a professional architect because it can grow much like earth-bound cities with incremental individual investments unlike those that require large start-up investments the main disadvantage is that the smaller versions use a large structure to support the radiation shielding which rotates with them in large sizes the shielding becomes economical because it grows roughly as the square of the colony radius the number of people their habitats and the radiators to cool them grow roughly as the cube of the colony radius other concepts bubbleworld the bubbleworld or insideoutside concept was originated by dandridge m cole in 1964 the concept calls for drilling a tunnel through the longest axis of a large asteroid of iron or nickel-iron composition and filling it with a volatile substance possibly water a very large solar reflector would be constructed nearby focusing solar heat onto the asteroid first to weld and seal the tunnel ends then more diffusely to slowly heat the entire outer surface as the metal softens the water inside expands and inflates the mass while rotational forces help shape it into a cylindrical form once expanded and allowed to cool it can be spun to produce artificial gravity by centrifugation and the interior filled with soil air and water by creating a slight bulge in the middle of the cylinder a ring-shaped lake can be made to form reflectors would allow sunlight to enter and to be directed where needed this method would require a significant human and industrial presence in space to be at all feasible the concept was popularized by science fiction author larry niven in his known space stories describing such worlds as the primary habitats of the belters a civilization who had colonized the asteroid belt asteroid terrarium a similar idea to the bubble world the asteroid terrarium appears in the novel 2312 authored by hard science fiction writer kim stanley robinson bishop ring a speculative design using carbon nanotubes a bishop ring is a torus 1000km in radius 500km in width and with atmosphere retention walls 200km in height the habitat would be large enough that it could be roofless open to outer space on the inner rim mckendree cylinder another concept that would use carbon nanotubes a mckendree cylinder is paired cylinders in the same vein as the island three concept but each 460km in radius and 4600km long versus 32km radius and 32km long in the island three

projects the following projects and proposals while not truly space habitats incorporate aspects of what they would have and may represent stepping stones towards eventually building of space habitats the nautilus-x multi-mission space exploration vehicle mmsev this 2011 nasa proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle included an artificial gravity compartment intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration the partial-g torus-ring centrifuge would utilize both standard metal-frame and inflatable spacecraft structures and would provide 011 to 069g if built with the 40 feet 12m diameter option the iss centrifuge demo also proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the multi-mission space exploration vehicle the structure would have an outside diameter of 30 feet 91m with a 30 inches 760mm ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 008 to 051g partial gravity this test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a sleep module for iss crew the bigelow commercial space station was announced in mid-2010 the initial build-out of the station is expected in 20142015 bigelow has publicly shown space station design configurations with up to nine modules containing 100000cuft 2800m of habitable space bigelow began to publicly refer to the initial configuration as space complex alpha in october 2010 history the idea of space habitats either in fact or fiction goes back to the second half of the 19th century the brick moon a fictional story written in 1869 by edward everett hale is perhaps the first treatment of this idea in writing in 1903 space pioneer konstantin tsiolkovsky speculated about rotating cylindrical space colonies with plants fed by the sun in beyond planet earth in the 1920s john desmond bernal and others speculated about giant space habitats dandridge m cole in the late 1950s and 1960s speculated about hollowing out asteroids and then rotating them to use as settlements in various magazine articles and books notably islands in space the challenge of the planetoids in fiction the space habitats have inspired a large number of fictional societies in science fiction some of the most popular and recognizable are in the japanese gundam universe the space station deep space nine and the space station babylon 5 the 2013 science-fiction movie elysium takes place on both a ravaged earth and a luxurious rotating wheel space station called elysium in the
