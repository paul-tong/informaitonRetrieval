the ming treasure voyages were the seven maritime expeditions by ming chinas treasure fleet between 1405 and 1433 the yongle emperor initiated the construction of the treasure fleet in 1403 the grand project resulted in seven far-reaching ocean voyages to the coastal territories and islands in and around the south china sea the indian ocean and beyond admiral zheng he was commissioned to command the treasure fleet for the expeditions six of the voyages occurred during the yongle reign r 140224 while the seventh voyage occurred under the xuande reign r 14251435 the first three voyages reached up to calicut on indias malabar coast while the fourth voyage went as far as hormuz in the persian gulf afterwards the fleet made voyages farther away to the arabian peninsula and east africa the chinese expeditionary fleet was heavily militarized and carried great amounts of treasures which served to project chinese power and wealth to the known world they brought back many foreign ambassadors whose kings and rulers were willing to declare themselves tributaries of china during the course of the voyages they destroyed chen zuyis pirate fleet at palembang conquered the sinhalese kotte kingdom of king alekeshvara and defeated the forces of the semudera pretender sekandar in northern sumatra the chinese maritime exploits brought many foreign countries into the nations tributary system and sphere of influence through both military and political supremacy thus incorporating the states into the greater chinese world order under ming suzerainty moreover the chinese structured and established control over an expansive maritime network in which the region became integrated and its countries became interconnected on an economic and political level the treasure voyages were commanded and overseen by the eunuch establishment whose political influence was heavily dependent on imperial favor however within ming chinas imperial state system the civil officials were the primary political opponents of the eunuchs and the opposing faction against the expeditions around the end of the maritime voyages the civil government gained the upper hand within the state bureaucracy while the eunuchs gradually fell out of favor after the death of the yongle emperor over the course of the maritime voyages of the early 15th century ming china became the pre-eminent naval power by projecting its sea-power further to the south and west there is still much debate about issues such as the actual purpose of the voyages the size of the ships the magnitude of the fleet the routes taken the nautical charts employed the countries visited and the cargo carried background the yongle emperor inherited a powerful navy from his predecessor the hongwu emperor who himself had great appreciation for naval power the yongle emperor further strengthened and expanded the ming navy as an instrument for an expansive overseas policy the taizong shilu contains 24 short entries for the imperial orders for shipbuilding with figures pointing to at least 2868 ships from 1403 to 1419 over the course of 1403 fujian jiangxi zhejiang and huguangs provincial governments as well as nanjing suzhou and other cities military garrisons were ordered to begin construction of ships under the reign of the yongle emperor ming china underwent a militaristic expansionism with ventures such as the treasure voyages in 1403 the yongle emperor issued an imperial order to start the immense construction project of the treasure fleet zheng he was ordered to initiate the construction of the fleet the treasure fleet was known by its original designation xiafan guanjun lit foreign expeditionary armada in chinese sources it would come to comprise many trading ships warships and support vessels many of the fleets ships were built at the longjiang shipyard all of the treasure ships were also built there the shipyard was located on the qinhuai river near nanjing where it flows into the yangtze river many trees were cut along the min river and upper reaches of the yangtze to supply the necessary resources for the construction of the fleet the yongle emperor placed great trust in zheng he and appointed him to command the treasure fleet the emperor even gave zheng he blank scrolls with the imperial seal so the admiral could issue imperial orders at sea course first voyage in the third lunar month 30 march to 28 april of 1405 a preliminary order was issued for zheng he and others to take command of 27000 troops to the western ocean an imperial edict dated to 11 july 1405 was issued containing the order for the expedition it was addressed to zheng he wang jinghong and others the yongle emperor held a banquet for the crew on the evening before the fleets maiden voyage gifts were presented to the officers and the common crew according to their rank sacrifices and prayers were offered to tianfei the patron goddess of sailors hoping to ensure a successful journey and a safe passage during the voyage in the autumn of 1405 the treasure fleet had assembled at nanjing and was ready to depart from the city according to the taizong shilu 11 july 1405 entry about the dispatch of the fleet admiral zheng he and others departed for the first expedition bearing imperial letters to the countries of the western ocean and with gifts to their kings of gold brocade patterned silks and colored silk gauze according to their status the treasure fleet made a stop at liujiagang there the fleet was organized in squadrons while the fleets crew honored the goddess of sailors tianfei with prayers and sacrifices afterwards the fleet sailed down the chinese coast towards the mouth of the min river where they awaited the northeast monsoon at taiping anchorage in the changle district more prayers and sacrifices were conducted for tianfei by the crew during the wait for the northeast monsoon afterwards the fleet departed via the wuhumen lit five tiger passage in fujian the treasure fleet sailed to champa java malacca aru semudera lambri ceylon quilon and calicut from lambri the treasure fleet sailed straight through the indian ocean rather than follow the bay of bengal coastline to ceylon three days after the departure from lambri a ship split off and went to the andaman and nicobar islands the treasure fleet saw the mountains of ceylon after another six days and arrived at ceylons western coast two days thereafter they were met with a hostile attitude from alagakkonara so they left the place dreyer 2007 states that it is possible that admiral zheng he made port at quilonbut there is no account confirming thisbecause the king of quilon traveled with the fleet to china in 1407 mills 1970 states that the fleet may have made a four-month stay at calicut probably from december to april 1407 around cape comorin at the southern tip of the indian peninsula the treasure fleet changed direction and began its return journey to china during the return the fleet made port at malacca again in 1407 while returning homewards admiral zheng he and his associates engaged chen zuyi and his pirate fleet in battle at palembang chen zuyi was a pirate leader who had seized palembang on sumatra he dominated the maritime route of the malaccan strait the battle resulted in the defeat of chens pirate fleet by the chinese treasure fleet chen zuyi and his lieutenants were executed on 2 october 1407 the ming court appointed shi jinqing as the pacification superintendent of palembang thereby establishing an ally at palembang and securing access to this important port the fleet arrived back in nanjing on 2 october 1407 after accompanying the treasure fleet during the return journey the foreign envoys from calicut quilon semudera aru malacca and other unspecified nations visited the ming court to pay homage and present tribute in their local products the yongle emperor ordered the ministry of rites whose duties included the protocol concerning foreign ambassadors to prepare gifts for the foreign kings who had sent envoys to the court second voyage the imperial order for the second voyage was issued in october 1407 the edict was addressed to zheng he wang jinghong and hou xian lang yings qixiuleigao recorded that zheng he wang jinghong and hou xian were dispatched in 1407 the taizong shilu recorded that zheng he and others went as envoys to the countries of calicut malacca semudera aru jiayile java siam champa cochin abobadan quilon lambri and ganbali on 30 october 1407 a grand director was dispatched with a squadron to champa before zheng he followed with the main body of the fleet the fleet departed in the fifth year late 1407 or possibly early 1408 of the yongle reign the fleet traveled from nanjing to liujiagang to changle they then sailed to champa siam java malacca semudera aru and lambri on sumatra jiayile abobadan ganbali quilon cochin and calicut in india dreyer 2007 states that it is possible that siam and java were visited by the main fleet or by detached squadrons before regrouping at malacca during this voyage zheng he and his fleet did not land on ceylon the fleet was tasked to carry out the formal investure of mana vikraan as the king of calicut a tablet was placed in calicut to commemorate the relationship between china and india in this voyage the chinese would forcibly settle the enmity between ming china and java java was ruled by successive majapahit kings who had acted defiantly towards ming china since the hongwu reign dreyer 2007 states that during a civil war on java between 1401 and 1406 the king of west java killed 170 members of a chinese embassy who had come ashore in his rivals territory at east java the entry dated to 23 october 1407 in the ming shilu states that the western king of java had sent an envoy to the ming court to admit guilt for mistakenly killing 170 ming troops who had gone ashore to trade it further states that the ming court responded by demanding 60000 liang of gold for compensation and atonement warning that they would dispatch an army to punish the javanese ruler for his crime if he failed to comply and stating that the situation in annam referring to ming chinas successful invasion of vietnam can serve as an example the chinese accepted the payment and apology and restored diplomatic relations they would use the voyages to keep surveillance over java during the journey the fleet visited the pulau sembilan in the strait of malacca in the seventh year of the yongle reign 1409 according to fei xin he stated that the troops were sent there to cut wood dreyer 2007 concluded that the stop was during the return journey of the second voyage as the treasure fleet did not leave the chinese coast for the third voyage until early 1410 fei xins written words were in the seventh year of yongle zheng he and his associates sent government troops onto the island to cut incense they obtained six logs each eight or nine chi in diameter and six or seven zhang in length whose aroma was pure and far-ranging the pattern of the wood was black with fine lines the people of the island opened their eyes wide and stuck out their tongues in astonishment and were told that we are the soldiers of the heavenly court and our awe-inspiring power is like that of the gods the treasure fleet arrived back in nanjing in the summer of 1409 the possible confusion of whether zheng he undertook the second voyage stemmed from the fact that a chinese envoy was dispatched before zheng he had departed with the main body of the fleet the imperial edict for the third voyage was issued during the period of the second voyage whilst the treasure fleet was still in the indian ocean so either zheng he was absent when the court issued the imperial order or he had not accompanied the fleet during the second voyage on 21 january 1409 a grand ceremony was held in the honor of the goddess tianfei where she received a new title duyvendak thinks that zheng he could not have been on the second voyage because this ceremony was so important that it required zheng hes attendance mills 1970 citing duyvendak also states that zheng he did not accompany the fleet for this voyage however fei xin explicitly mentions zheng he when describing the 1409 stop at pulau sembilan which strongly suggests that zheng he had been on the second voyage according to dreyer 2007 third voyage yang rong 1515 about the conflict in ceylon the imperial order for the third voyage was issued on the first month of the seventh year of the yongle reign 16 january to 14 february 1409 it was addressed to zheng he wang jinghong and hou xian admiral zheng he embarked for this voyage in 1409 the fleet departed from liujiagang in the ninth month 9 october to 6 november 1409 and arrived at changle in the following month 7 november to 6 december they left changle in the twelfth month 5 january to 3 february 1410 for the seas they proceeded through the wuhumen at the entrance of the min river in fujian the fleet made stops at champa java malacca semudera ceylon quilon cochin and calicut they traveled to champa within 10 days wang jinghong and hou xian made short stops at siam malacca semudera and ceylon during detours arriving in ceylon in 1410 the treasure fleet landed at galle during the homeward journey in 1411 the treasure fleet would engage into a military confrontation with king alakeshvara alagakkonara of ceylon alakeshvara posed a threat to the neighboring countries and local waters of ceylon and southern india on arrival at ceylon the chinese were overbearing and contemptuous of the sinhalese whom they considered rude disrespectful and hostile they also resented that the sinhalese were committing attacks and piracy towards neighboring countries who had diplomatic relations with ming china admiral zheng he and a few of his troops traveled overland into kotte because alakeshvara had lured them into his territory alakeshvara cut off admiral zheng he and his 2000 accompanying troops from the treasure fleet anchored at colombo he also planned to launch an attack on the fleet in response admiral zheng he and his troops invaded kotte conquering its capital they took captive alakeshvara his family and principal officials the sinhalese army hastily returned and surrounded the capital but they were repeatedly defeated in battle against the invading chinese troops the opposing sinhalese army was said to have over 50000 troops the king and his family were taken captive to nanjing china admiral zheng he returned to nanjing on 6 july 1411 he presented the sinhalese captives to the yongle emperor who decided to free and return them to their country the chinese dethroned alakeshvara in favor of their ally parakramabahu vi as the king with the backing of zheng he and his fleet from then on the treasure fleet would experience no hostilities during visits to ceylon on subsequent treasure voyages fourth voyage on 18 december 1412 the yongle emperor issued the order for the fourth voyage admiral zheng he and others were commanded to lead it the yongle emperor attended an archery contest for the midsummer festival of 1413 5th day 5th month 11th year all the chinese officials and barbarian envoys were invited to attend this event duyvendak 1939 states that these envoys were so numerous that they most-likely comprised many of those whom admiral zheng he would escort back to their countries during the fourth voyage than just those from close neighbors this expedition would lead the treasure fleet into muslim countries so it must have been important for the chinese to seek out reliable interpreters the interpreter ma huan joined the voyages for the first time a 1523 inscription at a muslim mosque in xian recorded that on the 4th month of the 11th year admiral zheng he was there to seek reliable interpreters and found a man named hasan admiral zheng hes fleet left nanjing in 1413 probably in the autumn they set sail from fujian in the 12th month of the 11th year in the yongle reign 23 december 1413 to 21 january 1414 calicut was the westernmost destination during the previous voyages but now the fleet sailed to lands further away the taizong shilu recorded malacca java champa semudera aru cochin calicut lambri pahang kelantan jiayile ormuz bila maldives and sunla for this voyage the fleet sailed to champa kelatan pahang malacca palembang java lambri lide aru semudera ceylon jiayile opposite ceylon cochin and calicut they proceeded to liushan maldive and laccadive islands bila bitra atoll sunla chetlat atoll and hormuz at java the fleet delivered gifts and favors from the yongle emperor in return a javanese envoy arrived in china on 29 april 1415 presenting tribute in the form of western horses and local products while expressing gratitude in 1415 the fleet made a stop at northern sumatra during the journey homeward from hormuz they engaged sekandar at this point of the voyage sekandar had usurped the semudera throne from zain al-abidin but the chinese had formally recognized the latter as the king of semudera even though sekandar was an autonomous ruler he was not recognized by the chinese fei xin described sekandar as a false king who robbed stole and usurped the throne of semudera ma huan portrayed him as someone who attempted to overthrow the ruler the ming shilu noted that sekandar was the younger brother of the former king and plotted to kill the ruler admiral zheng he had orders to launch a punitive attack against the usurper and restore zain al-abidin as the rightful king in retaliation sekandar led his forces to attack the ming forces and was defeated he reportedly attacked with tens of thousands of soldiers the ming forces pursued sekandars forces to lambri where they caught sekandar his wife and his child king zain al-abidin later dispatched a tribute mission to express his gratefulness this conflict reaffirmed chinese power over the foreign states and the maritime route by protecting the local political authority that sheltered the trade sekandar was presented to the yongle emperor at the palace gate and later executed it is not known when this execution happened but ma huan stated that sekandar was publicly executed in the capital after the fleet returned on 12 august 1415 admiral zheng hes fleet returned to nanjing from his voyage the yongle emperor was away since 16 march 1413 for his second mongol campaign and hadnt returned when the fleet arrived after the fleets return rulers of 18 countries sent envoys bearing tribute to the ming court fifth voyage on 14 november 1416 the yongle emperor returned to nanjing on 19 november a grand ceremony was held where the yongle emperor bestowed gifts to princes civil officials military officers and the ambassadors of 18 countries on 19 december the eighteen ambassadors were received at the ming court on 28 december they visited the ming court to take their leave and were bestowed robes before their departure that day the yongle emperor ordered the undertaking of the fifth voyage which had the avowed objective to return the 18 ambassadors and to reward their kings admiral zheng he and other unnamed people had received orders to escort the ambassadors back home they carried imperial letters and many gifts for several kings the king of cochin received special treatment because he had sent tribute since 1411 and later also sent ambassadors to request the patent of investiture and a seal the yongle emperor granted him both requests conferred to him a long inscription allegedly composed by the emperor himself and gave the title state protecting mountain to a hill in cochin admiral zheng he may have left the chinese coast in the autumn of 1417 he first made port at quanzhou to load up the fleets cargoholds with porcelain and other goods archaeological finds of contemporary chinese porcelain have been excavated at the east african places visited by zheng hes fleet a ming tablet at quanzhou commemorates that admiral zheng he burned incense for divine protection for this voyage on 31 may 1417 the fleet visited champa pahang java palembang malacca semudera lambri ceylon cochin calicut shaliwanni possibly cannanore liushan maladive and laccadive islands hormuz lasa aden mogadishu brava zhubu and malindi for arabia and east africa the most-likely route was hormuz lasa aden mogadishu brava zhubu and then malindi duyvendak suggested that zheng he may have made a show of military force at mogadishu and lasa due to the unwelcome reception by the locals on 8 august 1419 the fleet had returned to china the yongle emperor was in beijing at the time but he ordered the ministry of rites to give monetary rewards to the fleets personnel the accompanied ambassadors were received at the ming court in the eighth lunar month 21 august to 19 september of 1419 their tribute included lions leopards dromedary camels ostriches zebras rhinoceroses antelopes giraffes and other exotic animals causing a great sensation among those at the ming court sixth voyage the taizong shilu 3 march 1421 entry noted that the envoys of sixteen countries hormuz and other countries were given gifts of paper and coin money and ceremonial robes and linings before returning to their respective countries under escort of the treasure fleet the imperial order for the sixth voyage was dated 3 march 1421 admiral zheng he was dispatched with imperial letters silk brocade silk floss silk gauze and other gifts for the rulers of these countries gong zhens xiyang fanguo zhi recorded a 10 november 1421 imperial edict instructing zheng he kong he zhu buhua and tang guanbao to arrange the provisions for hong bao and others for their dispatch to escort foreign envoys home the envoys of the 16 different states were escorted to their homelands by the treasure fleet its likely that the first few destinations were malacca and the three sumatran states of lambri aru and semudera the fleet was divided in several detached squadrons at semudera all the squadrons proceeded to ceylon whereafter they separated for jiayile cochin ganbali or calicut in southern india the squadrons traveled from there to their respective destinations at liushan maldive and laccadive islands hormuz at the persian gulf the three arabian states of djofar lasa and aden and the two african states of mogadishu and brava the eunuch zhou probably zhou man led the detached squadron to aden ma huan mentions zhou man and li xing in connection to the visit of aden their squadron may have also visited lasa and djofar according to the mingshi admiral zheng he personally visited ganbali as an envoy in 1421 of of the twelve visited nations west of sumatra this was the only one noted to have been visited by admiral zheng he himself even though quilon was not visited the squadron for mogadishu probably separated near quilon as a navigation point while the main fleet continued to calicut a large squadron proceeded further from calicut to hormuz they may have traveled via the laccadives on the return several squadrons regrouped at calicut and all the squadrons regrouped further at semudera siam was likely visited during the return journey the fleet returned on 3 september 1422 they brought with them envoys from siam semudera aden and other countries who bore tribute in local products the foreign envoys who traveled to china with the fleet proceeded overland or via the grand canal before reaching the imperial court at beijing in 1423 nanjing garrison on 14 may 1421 the yongle emperor had ordered the temporary suspension of the voyages at the expense of the treasure fleets voyages the imperial attention and funding was diverted for the third fourth and fifth mongol campaigns between 1422 and 1431 the treasure fleet remained in nanjing to serve in the citys garrison in 1424 admiral zheng he departed on a diplomatic mission to palembang meanwhile zhu gaozhi inherited the throne as the hongxi emperor on 7 september 1424 after the death of the yongle emperor on 12 august 1424 zheng hes return from palembang was after this death on 7 september 1424 the hongxi emperor terminated the undertaking of further treasure voyages he was hostile to the undertaking of the voyages nevertheless he kept the treasure fleet as a part of nanjings garrison the fleet also retained its original designation xiafan guanjun lit foreign expeditionary armada on 24 february 1425 he appointed admiral zheng he as the defender of nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the treasure fleet for the citys defense on 25 march 1428 the xuande emperor ordered zheng he and others to takeover the supervision for the rebuilding and repair of the great baoen temple at nanjing he completed the construction of the temple in 1431 its speculated that the funds for the construction of the great baoen temple was diverted from those for the treasure voyages seventh voyage gong zhen recorded that an imperial order was issued on 25 may 1430 for the arrangement of necessary provisions for the dispatch of zheng he wang jinghong li xing zhu liang yang zhen hong bao and others on official business to the countries of the western ocean it was addressed to yang qing luo zhi tang guanbo and yuan cheng on 29 june 1430 the xuande emperor issued his orders for the seventh voyage it was addressed to zheng he and others the xuanzong shilu reported that zheng he wang jinghong and others were sent to far-lying foreign lands to bring them into deference and submission the emperor wished to reinvigorate the tributary relations that had been promoted during the yongle reign before departing for the seventh voyage admiral zheng he and his associates had the liujiagang and changle inscriptions inscribed the xia xiyang provides valuable information as described hereafter about the dates and itinerary for this voyage the fleet embarked from longwan lit dragon bay in nanjing on 19 january 1431 on 23 january the fleet made a stop at xushan a currently-unknown island in the yangtze where the crew hunted animals on 2 february 1431 the fleet sailed through the fuzi passage present-day baimaosha channel to the estuary yangtze river before arriving at liujiagang the following day 3 february on 14 march 1431 the liujiagang inscription was erected there on 8 april 1431 the fleet arrived at changle where they remained until mid-december the changle inscription dated to the 11th month of the 6th year of the xuande reign was erected during the end of their stay there on 16 december they traveled to the fu tou shan possibly near fuzhou the treasure fleet sailed through the wuhumen on 12 january 1431 on 27 january 1432 the fleet made a call at the capital city vijaya near present-day qui nhon of champa before departing on 12 february on 7 march 1432 the fleet arrived at java where they made port at surabaya the fleet remained in the region before departing on 13 july on 24 july 1432 the fleet arrived at palembang before departing on 27 july from palembang the fleet sailed down the musi river through the banka strait passing the lingga and riau archipelagos the lingga and riau archipelagos had a considerable pirate population that posed a threat to passing ships but these pirates posed no threat to the treasure fleet on 3 august 1432 the treasure fleet arrived at malacca the fleet departed from malacca on 2 september 1432 they traveled to semudera and arrived there on 12 september on 2 november 1432 the fleet departed from semudera on 28 november 1432 the fleet arrived at beruwala on ceylon the fleet departed from beruwala on 2 december they arrived at calicut on 10 december the fleet departed from calicut to hormuz on 14 december 1432 they arrived at hormuz on 17 january 1433 the treasure fleet remained in hormuz for almost two months before traveling homeward on 9 march 1433 admiral zheng he and his associates of the eight destinations recorded for the seventh voyage in the xia xiyang hormuz was the westernmost place the mingshi and other sources described the voyage with at least a total of 17 visited countries including those already mentioned in the xia xiyang the additional destinations recorded in the mingshi are coimbator ganbali bengal laccadive and maldive island chains djofar lasa aden mecca mogadishu and brava gong zhen even recorded a total of 20 visited countries during the voyage as fei xin mentioned the fleet made a stop at the andaman and nicobar island chains he wrote that on 14 november 1432 the fleet arrived at cuilanxu probably the great nicobar island where they anchored for three days due to the unfavorable winds and waves he further wrote that the native men and women came in log boats to trade coconuts the neighboring aru nagur lide and lambri were certainly visited by a few ships according to dreyer 2007 on the fleets way to semudera in northern sumatra admiral zheng he is mentioned in the mingshi in connection to the visits of ganbali possibly coimatore lasa djorfar magadishu and brava dreyer 2007 states that the account is unclear on whether he did go to those places in person the wording in the mingshi could indicate that he did as the account stated that he proclaimed imperial instructions to the kings of these countries although this may as well not be the case because the fleet only made short stops at calicut 4 days outward and 9 days homeward that could not have provided enough time to travel overland to ganbali unless the location did not refer to coimatore but elsewhere in southern india the overland journey may have been undertaken by someone else than zheng he himself the mingshi account about lasa states that ambassadors from lasa aden and brava traveled with zheng he to china this meant that the ships carrying them had possibly reassembled with the main fleet in calicut according to dreyer 2007 depending on whether zheng he visited these countries in person or remained with the main portion of the fleet dreyer 2007 thinks that the detached squadrons had probably already assembled at calicut for its homeward journey because the main fleet didnt stay there for long hong bao commanded a squadron for the journey to bengal ma huan traveled with hong bao in this squadron it is not known when they exactly detached from the treasure fleet for bengal they sailed from semudera straight to bengal at bengal they traveled to chittagong then to sonargaon and finally to the capital gaur they then proceeded to sail from bengal straight to calicut admiral zheng hes fleet had departed from calicut for hormuz by the time hong baos squadron arrived in calicut once in calicut noticing that local ships were being prepared for mecca hong bao sent seven chinese men to accompany a ship bound for mecca it is likely that one of the seven men was ma huan ma huan wrote about mecca in the chapter tianfang heavenly cube a reference to the qaaba after a year the seven men returned with commodities and valuables that they had purchased which included giraffes lions and ostriches dreyer 2007 suggests that hong bao may also have been involved with several other destinations such as djofar lasa aden mogadishu and brava however p pelliot suggests that the squadrons detached from the fleet at hormuz to travel to aden the east african ports and perhaps lasa dreyer 2007 states that the following countries may also have been visited by a few of the ships when the fleet passed by them siam the northern sumatran states of aru nagur lide and lambri when sailing to semudera quilon and cochin when sailing to calicut mills 1970 concluded that zheng hes associates and not admiral zheng he himself had visited siam aru nagur lide lambri nicobar islands bengal quilon cochi coimbatore maldive islands dhufar lasa aden mecca mogadishu and brava the xia xiyang also provided the dates and itinerary as described hereafter for the return route of the seventh voyage the fleet at hormuz departed on 9 march 1433 and arrived at calicut on 31 march on 9 april the fleet departed from calicut they sailed straight through the open ocean on 25 april the fleet arrived at semudera on 1 may the fleet departed from semudera on 9 may the fleet arrived at malacca the fleet arrived at the kunlun ocean on 28 may 1433 on 13 june the fleet arrived at vijaya present-day qiu nhon the fleet departed from vijaya on 17 june the xia xiyang notes several geographical sightings from now until the fleet entered taicang the fleet arrived at taicang on 7 july 1433 the xia xiyang notes that it had not recorded the journey from taicang to the capital on 22 july they arrived in the capital beijing on 27 july the xuande emperor bestowed ceremonial robes and paper money to the fleets personnel dreyer 2007 states that they did not make port at ceylon or southern india because they were sailing under favorable conditions and were running before the southwest monsoon ma huan recorded that the various detached ships reassembled in malacca to wait for favorable winds before continuing their return admiral zheng he came back with envoys from 11 countries including one from mecca on 14 september 1433 as recorded in the xuanzong shilu the following envoys came to court to present tribute king zain al-abidin of semudera sent his younger brother halizhi han and others king bilima of calicut sent his ambassador gebumanduluya and others king keyili of cochin sent his ambassador jiabubilima and others king parakramabahu vi of ceylon sent his ambassador mennidenai and others king ali of djofar sent his ambassador hajji hussein and others king al-malik az-zahir yahya b ismail of aden sent his ambassador puba and others king devaraja of coimbatore sent his ambassador duansilijian and others king saif-ud-din of hormuz sent the foreigner malazu the king of old kayal jiayile sent his ambassador abd-ur-rahman and others and the king of mecca sent the headman toumu shaxian and others aftermath during the course of the voyages ming china had become the pre-eminent naval power of the early 15th century the yongle emperor had extended imperial control over foreign lands during the span of the voyages however in 1433 the voyages ceased and ming china turned away from the seas it is not exactly known why the voyages completely ended in 1433 duyvendak 1939 suggested that the cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses but ray 1987 finlay 1992 and dreyer 1997 noted that the costs for undertaking the voyages had not overburdened the ming treasury ray 1987 adds that the ming treasure voyages were a profitable enterprise rejecting the notion that the voyages were terminated because they were wasteful costly or uneconomic even though civil officials did have ill feelings towards eunuchs for their overbearing nature and interference in state affairs much of the hostility that came to characterize the relationship between the officials and eunuchs manifested at a time long after the termination of the voyages when eunuchs wielded their power to enrich themselves through extortion and persecute their critics as such according to lo 1958 and ray 1987 the hostility between these factions can not explain the cessation of the voyages furthermore lo 1958 notes that admiral zheng he was on friendly terms with many high officials and was respected by them while ray 1987 mentions that eunuchs such as zheng he and hou xian were held in high esteem by the court the voyages were also favorably depicted in contemporary records the trade was still flourishing long after the voyages had ceased chinese ships continued to control the eastern asian maritime trade they also continued trading around india and east africa however the imperial tributary system over the foreign regions and state monopoly over the foreign trade gradually broke down as time progressed while private trade rose to supplant the commerce under the states tributary system in addition the foreign commerce shifted to the domain of local authorities which further undermined the authority of the central government the ming treasure voyages provided direct links between the ming court and foreign tribute states thereby outflanking private commerce as well as local civil officials who tried to sabotage the imperial prohibitions targeting overseas exchange ray 1987 states that the cessation of the ming treasure voyages primarily happened as traders and bureaucrats for reasons of economic self-interest gradually collapsed the framework supporting the state-controlled maritime enterprise and the strict regulation of the private commerce that was subjected to prohibitive policies through their connections in beijing similarly lo 1958 states that rich and influential individuals who tried to safeguard their interests and were thus antagonistic to the governments monopoly of foreign trade undermined efforts to restore the trade to official channels and thus possibly the revival of the voyages through their connections in beijing the nobility and military were an important part of the ruling elite during the hongwu and yongle reigns over time the political power gradually shifted away from both the nobility and military to the civil officials as a consequence the eunuch faction were unable to gather enough support to initiate projects opposed by the civil government civil officials remained wary of future attempts of the eunuchs to reinitiate the treasure voyages moreover no later emperor would seriously consider undertaking new expeditions the withdrawal of ming chinas treasure fleet left an enormous void in the dominance over the indian ocean impact goals and consequences the voyages were diplomatic militaristic and commercial in nature they were conducted to establish imperial control over the maritime trade to bring the maritime trade into the tributary system and to force foreign countries into compliance within the tributary system the diplomatic aspect comprised the announcement of the yongle emperors accession to the throne the establishment of hegemony over the foreign countries and providing safe passage to foreign envoys who came bearing tribute the chinese didnt seek territorial control as they were primarily motivated by the political and economic control across space entailing a domination over a vast network with its ports and shipping lanes finlay 2008 underscores the goal of controlling maritime commerce in which the ming treasure voyages are regarded as an attempt to reconcile chinas need for maritime commerce with the governments suppression of the private aspects representing a deployment of state power to bring into line the reality of seaborne commerce with an expansive conception of chinese hegemony the voyages had a significant and lasting effect on the organization of a maritime network utilizing and creating nodes and conduits in its wake thereby restructuring international relationships and exchanges it was especially of note as no other polity had exerted naval dominance over all sectors of the indian ocean prior to the these voyages the ming promoted alternative nodes as a strategy to establish control over the network for instance due to chinese involvement ports such as malacca in southeast asia cochin on the malabar coast and malindi on the swahili coast had grown as key alternatives to other important and established ports through the voyages ming china intervened with the local affairs of foreign states and asserted itself in foreign lands the chinese had installed or supported friendly local regimes captured or executed rivals of local authorities and threatened hostile local rulers into compliance the appearance of the ming treasure fleet generated and intensified competition among contending polities and rivals each seeking an alliance with the ming the voyages had a lasting impact that led to the western oceans regional integration and the increase in international circulation of people ideas and goods it also provided a platform for cosmopolitan discourses which took place in locations such as the ships of the ming treasure fleet the ming capitals of nanjing as well as beijing and the banquet receptions organized by the ming court for foreign representatives diverse groups of people from across the maritime countries congregated interacted and traveled together as the ming treasure fleet sailed from and to ming china the chinese had the intention to civilize the so-called barbarian peoples by bringing them into formal submission within ming chinas greater world order foreign rulers were forced to acknowledge the inherent moral and cultural superiority of china an obligation that could be achieved by paying homage and presenting tribute before the ming court during the course of the voyages the yongle emperor reasserted the political and cultural hegemony of ming china over all others the cultural aspect of the voyages appears in the liujiagang inscription which noted that those among the foreigners who were resisting the transforming influence genghua of chinese culture and were disrespectful we captured alive and brigands who indulged in violence and plunder we ex-terminated consequently the sea-route was purified and tranquillised and the natives were enabled quietly to pursue their avocations the treasure fleet was as mills 1970 characterized an instrument of aggression and political dominance it brought forth the manifestation of chinas power and wealth to awe foreign lands under chinese hegemony this was actualized by showing the ming flag and establishing a military presence along the maritime trade routes diplomatic relationships came to be based on a mutually beneficial maritime commerce as well as a visible presence of a chinese militaristic naval force in foreign waters the ming chinese naval superiority was namely a crucial factor in this interaction as it was inadvisable to risk punitive action from the chinese fleet in addition its also reasoned that the worthwhile and profitable nature of the ming treasure voyages for foreign countries was a persuading factor to comply there is a theory considered very unlikely suggesting that the voyages was initiated to search for the dethroned jianwen emperor this search is mentioned as a reason for the voyages in the later mingshi as the yongle emperor had usurped the throne it actually may have been that he sought to legitimize his reign by forcing the foreign countries to recognize their tributary status within ming chinas greater world order to this end according to wang 1998 the announced intention of the yongle emperor to find the deposed jianwen emperor may have served no more than a public justification for the voyages in face of the prohibitive policies for military actions overseas from the hongwu reign another theory also considered very unlikely explained that the voyages were triggered in response to another power across asia namely the timurid state of tamerlane an enemy of ming china however upon tamerlanes death in 1405 ming china was left unchallenged by the timurid because its new ruler shahrukh r 14051447 normalized diplomatic relations with china and was preoccupied with holding his state together the jianwen and tamerlane factors are both absent from contemporary historical sources so they lack the support and conformation to be accepted policy and administration zheng he served as the grand director in the directorate of palace servants a eunuch-dominated department before his appointment to command the expeditions construction projects were usually the domain of eunuchs who were often assigned to supervise them the treasure fleets construction was not different in that eunuchs were assigned to supervise it while the military were assigned to carry it out civil officials criticized the state expenses brought by the fleets construction but the emperor was set to continue his grand plans in the ming court the civil officials were the faction who were against the voyages in contrast the eunuch establishment stood at the head of the fleet and the expeditions the civil officials condemned the expeditions as extravagant and wasteful but the yongle emperor was unconcerned about the costs of the voyages and was determined to undertake it traditionally the civil officials were political opponents of the eunuch faction but also to the military who crewed the fleet this political and institutional disadvantage within the state system contributed to the inherent opposition of the civil officials against the voyages on cultural grounds the hostility came forth out of the trade and acquisition of strange foreign goods which conflicted with their confucian ideologies the undertaking of these expeditions only remained possible as long as the eunuchs maintained imperial favor the hongwu emperor was wary of the political and social consequences that maritime commerce could bring so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade this policy continued well into the yongle emperors reign in addition the yongle emperor aimed at consolidating imperial control over maritime commerce stopping the coastal criminality and disorder providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs exporting chinese products to foreign markets importing desired goods for chinese consumers extending the tributary system and displaying imperial majesty to the seas the voyages functioned as trade commissions in the governments attempts to regulate maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporating it into the tributary system there was seemingly an idea about a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies the emperors interest in the voyages was the highest during the period spanning the first three voyages but he became more occupied with his offensive military campaigns against the mongols after establishing the capital at beijing by the fourth voyage the emperor showed interest to expand the scope of trade and diplomatic activity to west asia the chinese therefore sought and employed interpreters of persian or arabic such as ma huan and guo chongli to accompany the fleet after the transfer of the capital from nanjing to beijing the south and the seas were given less and less attention from emperors and officials alike the hongxi emperor wished to revert this predecessors relocation of the capital but he died on 29 may 1425 and thus this never took place he was succeeded by the xuande emperor who remained in beijing in contrast to the hongxi emperor who relied on civil officials during his reign the xuande emperor relied on eunuchs during his reign dreyer 2007 states that the prospects for the voyages would have been better if the capital was relocated back to nanjing because the court would have been near the longjiang shipyards where most of the ships were built and the places where the voyages commenced minister of finance xia yuanji was a vocal opponent to the treasure voyages the hongxi emperor was also fiercely against the treasure voyages throughout his reign after the advice of xia yuanji the emperor ordered the cessation of the treasure voyages on 7 september 1424 the day of his accession to the throne when the xuande emperor ordered the seventh voyage he went against the general court opinion this was after the death of xia yuanji on 19 february 1430 after 1433 the civil officials succeeded in halting subsequent maritime expeditions the ships were left to rot while their lumber was sold for fuel in nanjing the mariners were reassigned to load grain on barges of the grand canal and to build the emperors mausoleum after the voyages subsequent ming emperors would reject the yongle emperors policy of bringing maritime trade into the structure of the tributary system personnel and organization the fleet comprised an array of various ships each likely fulfilling specialized functions each treasure ship was crewed by about 500 men according to mills 1970 or at least 600 men according to finlay 1992 the high-ranking officersadmiral zheng he and his associateswere from the eunuch establishment the majority of the crew came from the ming military the crew was mostly recruited from fujian there were seven grand directors taijianwho served as the ambassadors and commanders of the fleetfollowed by 10 junior directors shaojian admiral zheng he was one of the grand directors including these personnel who were all eunuchs there was a total of 70 eunuchs in command of the treasure fleet this was followed by 2 brigadiers du zhihuishi 93 captains zhihuishi 104 lieutenants qianhu and 103 sub-lieutenants bohu there were 180 medical personnel a bureau director from the ministry of finance two secretaries two protocol officers from the court of state ceremonial an astrological officer and four astrologers the personnel also had guard judges wei zhenfu and battalion judges suo zhenfu the remaining personnel included petty officers qixiao or quanxiao brave corps yongshi power corps lishi military soldiers referred as guanjun official soldiers or qijun flag soldiers supernumeraries yuding boatsman minshao buyers maiban and clerks shushou zhu yunmings xia xiyang records the following personnel officers and petty officers guanxiao soldiers qijun mess leaders huozhang helmsman tuogong anchormen bandingshou interpreters tongshi business managers banshi accountants susuanshi doctors yishi anchor mechanics tiemiao caulkers munian sailmakers dacai sailors shuishou and boatmen minshaoren the liujiagang inscriptions records zheng he and wang jinghong as the principal envoys it also records zhu liang zhou man hong bao yang zhen and zhang da as deputy envoys the changle inscription repeats this but adds li xing and wu zhong as deputy envoys all the recorded envoys are noted to have carried the rank of grand director in both inscriptions except zhang da who was noted with the rank of senior assistant director in the liujiagang inscription and the rank of grand director in the changle inscription additionally the changle inscription mentions zhu zhen and wang heng as the brigadiers these people and unnamed others are mentioned on the respective inscriptions as those who have composed it the changle inscription also mentions that the daoist priest yang yichu begged to erect the respective stele the two inscriptions state that admiral zheng he and his associates had commanded several tens of thousands of government soldiers and over one hundred oceangoing ships for each voyage for the first voyage the fleet had a personnel of 27800 or 27870 men the treasure fleet comprised a total of 317 ships for this voyage it included 62 treasure ships it may also be 63 treasure ships the mingshi states that the fleet had 62 treasure ships and a crew of 27800 for the first voyage tan qians guoque records 63 treasure ships and a crew of 27870 for the first voyage the zuiweilu records a personnel of 37000 but this is probably an error yan congjians shuyu shilu records an imperial order for the construction of 250 ships specifically for the voyages to the western ocean this actually refers to two separate imperial ordersas recorded in the taizong shiluboth to the nanjings capital guards for 200 ships haiyunchuan lit seagoing transport ships on 4 september 1403 and for 50 ships haichuan lit seagoing ships on 1 march 1404 however the taizong shilu did not record the purpose for which these 250 ships were constructed it also records a 2 march 1404 imperial order for fujian to construct five ships haichuan to be used in the voyages to the western ocean these 255 ships plus the 62 treasure ships adds up to the total of 317 ships for the second voyage it is thought that the treasure fleet comprised 249 ships on 5 october 1407 as the taizong shilu records wang hao was ordered to supervise the conversion of 249 ships in preparation for embassies to the countries at the western ocean this was close to the date when the second voyage was ordered thus the fleet likely comprised these 249 ships for the second voyage the number of treasure ships or personnel is not known for the third voyage fei xins xingcha shenglan recorded that the fleet had 48 haibo lit ocean traders and a crew of over 27000 dreyer 2007 states that fei xin was probably referring to the treasure ships with haibo yan congjians shuyu zhouzilu and lu rongs shuyuan zaji used the term treasure ship instead when they mentioned the 48 ships for this voyage coincidently the taizong shilu recorded the 14 february 1408 imperial order for the construction of 48 treasure ships to the ministry of works at nanjing these were possibly the 48 treasure ships for the third voyage dreyer 2007 states that the treasure fleet likely had an undisclosed array of support ships besides the 48 treasure ships ma huans yingya shenglan recorded 63 treasure ships for the fourth voyage these were probably accompanied by support ships the fleet was crewed by 28560 men or 27670 men fei xin recorded a personnel of 27670 for this voyage but another source recorded 28560 theres no record for the number of ships or personnel for the fifth voyage on 2 october 1419 an order was issued for the construction of 41 treasure ships from an undisclosed shipbuilder it is possible that admiral zheng he made use of these ships for the sixth voyage most scholars have concluded that these were likely used for the sixth voyage but many other treasure ships had already been constructed or were in construction by that time theres no specific figure for the ships or personnel of the sixth voyage the treasure fleet probably made use of several dozen of the treasure ships which was accompanied by half a dozen support vessels each for the seventh voyage the liujiagang and changle inscriptions speak of over a hundred large ships jubo lit great trading vessels this probably included most of the remaining treasure ships according to dreyer 2007 the treasure ships were likely accompanied by support ships the treasure fleet had 27550 men as personnel for the voyage military affairs before the voyages there was turmoil around the seas near the chinese coast and distant maritime regions characterized by piracy banditry slave trade or other illicit activities the treasure fleet had a large number of warships to protect their precious cargo and to secure the maritime routes they established a substantial chinese military presence around the south china sea and trading cities in southern india especially the early stages of the voyages were characterized by highly militaristic objectives as the chinese stabilized the sea passages from hostile entities as well strengthened their own position and maintained their status in the region even though admiral zheng he sailed through the oceans with a military force larger and stronger than any local power there is no written evidence in historical sources that there was any attempt that they forcibly tried to control the maritime traderather than through exploration and promotion of tradein the regions of the south china sea and indian ocean nevertheless dreyer 2007 adds that it must have been a terrifying apparition when the large chinese fleet came within visible reach before the coastline of a foreign country bringing any state into submission by the sole sight of it alone from the fourth voyage onwards the treasure fleet ventured further than their usual end-destination of calicut to lands beyond where there would be less direct hostilities the fleet engaged and defeated chen zuyis pirate fleet in palembang alakeshvaras forces in ceylon and sekandars forces in semudera bringing security and stability of the maritime routes via chinese control these battles served as a reminder of the tremendous power of ming china to the countries along the maritime routes chen zuyi of palembang alakeshvara of ceylon and sekandar of semudera were viewed as hostile threats in their regions on the malabar coast calicut and cochin were in an intense rivalry so the ming decided to intervene by granting special status to cochin and its ruler keyili for the fifth voyage zheng he was instructed to confer a seal upon keyili of cochin and enfeoff a mountain in his kingdom as the zhenguo zhi shan mountain which protects the country zheng he delivered a stone tablet inscribed with a proclamation composed by the yongle emperor to cochin as long as cochin remained under the protection of ming china the zamorin of calicut was unable to invade cochin and a military conflict was averted the cessation of the ming treasure voyages consequently had negative results for cochin as the zamorin of calicut would eventually launch an invasion against cochin in malacca the chinese actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for the voyages into the indian ocean malacca had been a relatively insignificant region not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both ma huan and fei xin and was a vassal region of siam in 1405 the ming court dispatched zheng he with a stone tablet enfeoffing the western mountain of malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country the chinese also established a government depot as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers ma huan reported that siam did not dare to invade malacca thereafter the rulers of malacca such as king paramesvara in 1411 would pay tribute to the chinese emperor in person in 1431 when a malaccan representative complained that siam was obstructing tribute missions to the ming court the xuande emperor dispatched zheng he carrying a threatening message for the siamese king saying you king should respect my orders develop good relations with your neighbours examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively diplomacy and commerce the treasure ships had an enormous cargo of various products admiral zheng returned to china with many kinds of tribute goods such as silver spices sandalwood precious stones ivory ebony camphor tin deer hides coral kingfisher feathers tortoise shells gums and resin rhinoceros horn sapanwood and safflower for dyes and drugs indian cotton cloth and ambergris for perfume they even brought back exotic animals such as ostriches elephants and giraffes the imports from the voyages provided large quantities of economic goods that fueled chinas own industries for instance there was so much cobalt oxide from persia that the porcelain industry at jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages the fleet also returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity in chinese society there were sometimes so many chinese goods unloaded into an indian port that it could take months to price everything the treasure voyages resulted in a flourishing ming economy while boosting the lucrative maritime commerce significantly the commodities that the ships carried included three major categories gifts to be bestowed on rulers items for exchange of goods or payment of goods with fixed prices at low rates eg gold silver copper coins and paper money and items in which china had the monopoly eg musks ceramics and silks however the ming trade enterprise also saw significant changes and developments in which the chinese themselves began trading and supplying the commodities that were non-chinese in origin and earlier entirely in the hands of the indians arabs and other foreigners this highlighted the commercial character of the voyages in which the chinese further expanded upon the already large profits from their trade the impact of the ming expeditions on commerce was on multiple levels it established imperial control over local private commercial networks expanded tributary relations and thereby brought commerce under state supervision established court-supervised transactions at foreign ports and thereby generate substantial revenue for both parties and increased production and circulation of commodities across the region imperial proclamations were issued to foreign kings meaning that they could either submit and be bestowed with rewards or refuse and be pacified under the threat of an overwhelming military force foreign kings had to reaffirm their recognition of the chinese emperors superior status by presenting tribute many countries were enrolled as tributaries the treasure fleet conducted the transport of the many foreign envoys to china and back but some envoys traveled independently those rulers who submitted received political protection and material rewards geography and society during the onset of their voyages the treasure fleet would embark from the longjiang shipyard north-west of nanjing they would then sail down the yangtze river to liujiagang once there admiral zheng he would organize his fleet and make sacrifices to tianfei over the course of the following four to eight weeks the fleet would gradually proceed to taiping anchorage in changle fujian there the fleet would wait for the favorable northeast monsoon of winter before leaving the fujian coast they would reach the sea through the wuhumen for the voyages the fleet always visited the port qui nhon in champa first during the first three voyages from 1405 to 1411 the fleet followed the same basic maritime route from fujian to the first call in champa across the south china sea to java and sumatra up the strait of malacca to northern sumatra for assembly of the fleet across the indian ocean to ceylon then along the malabar coast to calicut for the time being the fleet sailed up to and no further than calicut during the fourth voyage the route was extended to hormuz during the fifth sixth and seventh voyage the fleet proceeded further to other destinations at the arabian peninsula and east africa for the sixth voyage the treasure fleet sailed up to calicut where several detached squadrons proceeded to further destinations at the arabian peninsula and east africa for the seventh voyage the treasure fleet followed the route up to hormuz while detached squadrons traveled to the other far-lying destinations at the arabian peninsula and east africa the treasure fleet sailed the equatorial and subtropical waters of the south china sea and indian ocean where they were dependent on the circumstances of the annual cycle of monsoon winds the return journey was set during the late summer and early autumn because favorable monsoon winds would be present during this period during all the voyages the fleet departed from sumatra to sail westward across the indian ocean the journey from northern sumatra to ceylon involved sailing for about two to four weeks without laying sight on land the first part of ceylon that would be visible after departing from sumatra was namanakuli or parrots beak mountain the eastern-most mountain 6680ft in elevation and 45 miles away from the coast two or three days after sighting this geographical feature the treasure fleet would adjust their course to sail south of dondra head at ceylon the fleet would have been at sea for a considerable long time by then since departing from sumatra thus they would make a call at a port in ceylon usually at beruwala and sometimes at galle although they have made port at both locations it was clear that the fleets preference was beruwala over galle ma huan characterized beruwala as the wharf of the country of ceylon northern sumatra was an important region for the fleets anchorage and assembly before they proceeded through the indian ocean to ceylon and southern india mainly its location rather than its wealth or products were important to the fleet ma huan stated that semudera was the main route to the western ocean characterizing it as the most important port of assembly for the western ocean ming china had cordial relations with calicut which was valuable as they tried to extend the tributary system to the states around the indian ocean ma huan described calicut as the great country of the western ocean he was very positive about the calicut authorities regulation of trade and attention to weights and measurements fei xin described calicut as the great harbor of the western ocean countries fei xin wrote that the people of mogadishu were bigoted and insincere wangyin both words can also mean stupid it was further mentioned that they often drilled their soldiers and practiced archery in contrast fei xin characterized the people of brava as pure and honest navigation admiral zheng he followed for the most part established trade routes during his voyages rather than unknown territory during the voyages the crew acquired and collected a large amount of navigational data the astrological officer and his four astrologers specifically recorded the astronomical data the general mass of navigational data were processed into different kinds of charts by a cartographic office the office included an astrological officer four astrologers and their clerks this provided the expeditionary commanders with the necessary navigational charts for their voyages many copies of the expeditionary charts were housed in the ministry of war additional navigational data were probably also supplied by local maritime pilots arab records indian records and earlier chinese records the mao kun map is associated with the route of the voyages the map is collected in the wubei zhi compiled by mao yuanyi it depicts various geographic locations from nanjing to hormuz as well as the east african coast with routes illustrated by dotted lines the directions are expressed by compass points and distances with references to navigational techniques such as depth sounding to avoid shallow waters and astronomy particularly along the northsouth route of africa where the latitude is determined by the height of constellations relative to the horizon the distances are expressed by time according to a watch system two hour periods the mao kun map is appended by four stellar diagrams used for determining the position of the ship in relation to the stars and constellations on specific sections of the maritime route faith and ceremony admiral zheng he and his associates about witnessing tianfeis divine lantern which represented the natural phenomena saint elmos fire the faith of the treasure fleets crew centered around tianfei the heavenly princess who was the goddess of sailors and seafarers the liujiagang and changle inscriptions suggest that zheng hes life was mostly defined by the treasure voyages and that his devotion to tianfei was the dominant faith that he adhered to the two inscriptions honored and commemorated the goddess tianfei admiral zheng he and his associates had established these inscriptions at the temples of tianfei at liujiagang on 14 march 1431 and changle between 5 december 1431 and 3 january 1432 these inscriptions make reference to the crew witnessing st elmos fire during dangerous storms and interpreting it as a sign of divine protection by tianfei the liujiagang and changle inscriptions are considered the epitaphs of the treasure voyages in galle at ceylon admiral zheng he set up a trilingual inscription dated 15 february 1409 the inscription is in three languages in which the chinese section praised the buddha the tamil section praised the local god tenavarai nayanar who was an incarnation of vishnu and the persian section praised allah each section contains a similar lists of offerings including items such as 1000 pieces of gold 5000 pieces of silver 100 rolls of silk 2500 catties of perfumed oil and a variety of bronze ornaments thus as shown by this inscription the chinese paid their respect to the three religions that were dominant in ceylon on 20 september 1414 bengali envoys presented a tribute giraffe in the name of king saif al-din hamzah shah of bengal r 14101412 to the yongle emperor of ming china the giraffe was presented as the qilin but this association was met with a dismissive attitude from the yongle emperor who rejected the laudatory memorials of his officials records and literature there are several extant contemporary accounts including ma huans yingya shenglan fei xins xingcha shenglan and gong zhens xiyang fanguo zhi ma huan served as an interpreter on the fourth sixth and seventh voyage guo chongli was ma huans collaborator on the yingya shenglan and participated in three of the expeditions fei xin served as a soldier on the third fifth and seventh expedition gong zhen served as zheng hes private secretary on the seventh voyage these three sources provide insightful observations to the political economic social cultural and religious conditions of the lands visited throughout the voyages in addition the liujiagang and changle inscriptions are valuable records by admiral zheng he and his associates themselves the ming shilu also provides a lot of the information relating to the treasure voyages particularly the exchange of ambassadors the work is divided into individual sections about the reigns of ming emperors zheng he lived through the reigns of five ming emperors but he directly served three emperors in his life he is mentioned in the taizong shilu of the yongle reign the renzong shilu of the hongxi reign and the xuanzong shilu of the xuande reign the taizong shilu had combined the second and third voyages into one expedition this record was followed by the mingshi this caused zheng hes palembang journey of 142425 to be wrongly construed as the sixth voyage to make up for the seven voyages however the liujiagang and changle inscriptions made a clear distinction between the second and third voyage as they correctly date the second voyage from 1407 to 1409 and the third voyage from 1409 to 1411 a number of later works have been preserved the accounts in the mingshi 1739 and huang xingzengs xiyang chaogong dianlu 1520 rely on ma huans original yingya shenglan zheng xiaos wuxuebian ca 1522 relies on zhang shengs rifacimento of ma huans yingya shenglan zhu yunmings qianwen ji a

harmony in the middle kingdom he never finds this seal in the story giving the suggestion that the world order cannot be restored by any other means than military force as noted in finlay 1992 luo maodengs novel contains a description of different classes of ships with their sizes the 36 nine-masted treasure ships baochuan were 444 by 18 zhang the 700 eight-masted horse ships machuan were 37 by 15 zhang the 240 seven-masted grain ships or supply ships liangchuan were 28 by 12 zhang the 300 six-masted billet ships or troop transports zuochuan were 24 by 94 zhang and the 180 five-masted combat ships or warships proper zhanchuan were 18 by 68 zhang dreyer 2007 argues that this work holds little to no evidential value as a historical source but also notes that duyvendak thinks that it may be based on some truth the kezuo zhuiyu and the shuyu zhouzilu describes the following circumstances of what happened to the official archives about the expeditions the chenghua emperor issued an order to retrieve the documents concerning the expeditions to the western ocean from the ministry of war archives but the official liu daxia had hidden and burned the documents liu daxia dismissed the accounts as deceitful exaggerations of bizarre things far removed from the testimony of peoples ears and eyes the shuyu zhouzilu then adds the following to the story the minister of war xiang zhong in office 14741477 had sent a clerk to retrieve the documents but the clerk could not find them after several days of searching liu daxia eventually confessed and justified his actions to xiang zhong by stating that the expeditions of sanbao to the western ocean wasted tens of myriads of money and grain and moreover the people who met their deaths on these expeditions may be counted by the myriads although he returned with wonderful things what benefit was it to the state this was merely an action of bad government of which ministers should severely disapprove even if the old archives were still preserved they should be destroyed in order to suppress a repetition of these things at the root xiang zhong was recorded to have been impressed by this explanation the mingshi the xuanzong shilu and the mingshi jishi benmo attributes the reason for the suppression and destruction of the archived records to preventing that the powerful eunuch wang zhi could consult it for his invasion of vietnam dreyer 2007 notes that liu daxia couldnt have had access to the records in his capacity at the time thus raising doubt about his actual involvement duyvendak 1939 stated that the ministry of war officials werent influential enough to stop the retrieval of the documents and therefore speculates that liu daxia may have destroyed them with the approval of the minister of war legacy girolamo sernigi 1499 about the then-unknown chinese visitors in 1499 shortly before vasco da gamas return from india to portugal girolamo sernigi reported on the portuguese accounts from da gamas expedition that certain vessels of white christians had made port at calicut on the malabar coast generations before their arrival he speculated that these unknown mariners could have been the germans or the russians but concluded that on the arrival of the captain da gama we may learn who these people are after his arrival at calicut vasco da gama began hearing tales of pale bearded men who sailed with their giant ships along the local coastal waters of calicut generations before the portuguese were not aware that these tales were about zheng hes fleets they would eventually discover that these unknown mariners were in fact the chinese da gamas men were apparently even mistaken for the chinese at first on arrival at the east african coast because the chinese had been the last-seen pale-skinned strangers arriving with large wooden ships in the memories of the east african people in calicut da gama had received permission to build a factory at chinacota where a chinese storehouse first stood eighty years before in the late 16th century juan gonzlez de mendoza wrote that it is plainly seene that the chinese did come with shipping into the indies having conquered al that is from china unto the farthest part thereof so that at this day there is great memory of them in the kingdom of calicut where be so many trees and fruits were brought thither by the chinos when that they were lords and governours of that countrie in november 1997 during a harvard university speech president jiang zemin praised admiral zheng he for spreading chinese culture abroad many present-day chinese people perceive these historical events namely the voyages were conducted in accordance with confucian ideals since 2005 commemorating the ming treasure voyages china has annually celebrated its national maritime day on 11 july that year also marked the 600th anniversary of zheng hes maiden voyage although the present-day popular narrative may emphasize the peaceful nature of the voyages especially in terms of the absence of territorial conquest and subjugation it overlooks the heavy militarization of the ming treasure fleet to exercise power projection and thereby promote its
