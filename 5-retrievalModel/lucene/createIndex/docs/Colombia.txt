pottery discovered in the americas found at san jacinto dates to 50004000bce indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now colombia by 12500bce nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes at the el abra tibit and tequendama sites near present-day bogot traded with one another and with other cultures from the magdalena river valley between 5000 and 1000bce hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies fixed settlements were established and pottery appeared beginning in the 1st millennium bce groups of amerindians including the muisca zen quimbaya and tairona developed the political system of cacicazgos with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques the muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the departments of boyac and cundinamarca high plateau altiplano cundiboyacense where they formed the muisca confederation they farmed maize potato quinoa and cotton and traded gold emeralds blankets ceramic handicrafts coca and especially rock salt with neighboring nations the tairona inhabited northern colombia in the isolated mountain range of sierra nevada de santa marta the quimbaya inhabited regions of the cauca river valley between the western and central ranges of the colombian andes most of the amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different some groups of indigenous people such as the caribs lived in a state of permanent war but others had less bellicose attitudes the incas expanded their empire onto the southwest part of the country spanish conquest alonso de ojeda who had sailed with columbus reached the guajira peninsula in 1499 spanish explorers led by rodrigo de bastidas made the first exploration of the caribbean coast in 1500 christopher columbus navigated near the caribbean in 1502 in 1508 vasco nez de balboa accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of gulf of urab and they founded the town of santa mara la antigua del darin in 1510 the first stable settlement on the continent santa marta was founded in 1525 and cartagena in 1533 spanish conquistador gonzalo jimnez de quesada led an expedition to the interior in april 1536 and christened the districts through which he passed new kingdom of granada in august 1538 he founded provisionally its capital near the muisca cacicazgo of bacat and named it santa fe the name soon acquired a suffix and was called santa fe de bogot two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period sebastin de belalczar conqueror of quito traveled north and founded cali in 1536 and popayn in 1537 from 1536 to 1539 german conquistador nikolaus federmann crossed the llanos orientales and went over the cordillera oriental in a search for el dorado the city of gold the legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the spanish and other europeans to new granada during the 16th and 17th centuries the conquistadors made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities indigenous allies were crucial to conquest as well as to creating and maintaining empire indigenous peoples in new granada experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as eurasian diseases such as smallpox to which they had no immunity with the risk that the land was deserted the spanish crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonised territories creating large farms and possession of mines in the 16th century the nautical science in spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the casa de contratacin and nautical science was an essential pillar of the iberian expansion colonial period in 1542 the region of new granada along with all other spanish possessions in south america became part of the viceroyalty of peru with its capital at lima in 1547 new granada became the captaincy-general of new granada within the viceroyalty in 1549 the royal audiencia was created by a royal decree and new granada was ruled by the royal audience of santa fe de bogot which at that time comprised the provinces of santa marta rio de san juan popayn guayana and cartagena but important decisions were taken from the colony to spain by the council of the indies in the 16th century europeans began to bring slaves from africa spain was the only european power that could not establish factories in africa to purchase slaves and therefore the spanish empire relied on the asiento system awarding merchants mostly from portugal france england and the dutch empire the license to trade enslaved people to their overseas territories also there were people who defended the human rights and freedoms of oppressed peoples the indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the spanish crown and to protect the indigenous peoples several forms of land ownership and regulation were established resguardos encomiendas and haciendas in 1717 the viceroyalty of new granada was originally created and then it was temporarily removed to finally be reestablished in 1739 the viceroyalty had santa f de bogot as its capital this viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern south america which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalties of new spain or peru and correspond mainly to todays venezuela ecuador and panama so bogot became one of the principal administrative centers of the spanish possessions in the new world along with lima and mexico city though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways after great britain declared war on spain in 1739 cartagena quickly became the british forces top target but an upset spanish victory during the war of jenkins ear a war with great britain for economic control of the caribbean cemented spanish dominance in the caribbean until the seven years war the 18th-century priest botanist and mathematician jos celestino mutis was delegated by viceroy antonio caballero y gngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of the new granada started in 1783 this became known as the royal botanical expedition to new granada which classified plants wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of santa fe de bogot in july 1801 the prussian scientist alexander von humboldt reached santa fe de bogot where he met with mutis in addition historical figures in the process of independence in new granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer francisco jos de caldas the scientist francisco antonio zea the zoologist jorge tadeo lozano and the painter salvador rizo independence since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization there were several rebel movements against spanish rule but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation the last one that sought outright independence from spain sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the colombian declaration of independence issued on 20 july 1810 a day which is now celebrated as the nations independence day this movement followed the independence of st domingue present-day haiti in 1804 which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion simn bolvar francisco de paula santander also would play a decisive role a movement was initiated by antonio nario who opposed spanish centralism and led the opposition against the viceroyalty cartagena became independent in november 1811 in 1811 the united provinces of new granada were proclaimed headed by camilo torres tenorio the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots federalism and centralism gave rise to a period of instability shortly after the napoleonic wars ended ferdinand vii recently restored to the throne in spain unexpectedly decided to send military forces to retake most of northern south america the viceroyalty was restored under the command of juan smano whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements ignoring the political nuances of the juntas the retribution stoked renewed rebellion which combined with a weakened spain made possible a successful rebellion led by the venezuelan-born simn bolvar who finally proclaimed independence in 1819 the pro-spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of colombia and in 1823 in venezuela the territory of the viceroyalty of new granada became the republic of colombia organized as a union of the current territories of colombia panama ecuador venezuela parts of guyana and brazil and north of maran river the congress of ccuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new republic simn bolvar became the first president of colombia and francisco de paula santander was made vice president however the new republic was unstable and three countries emerged from the collapse of gran colombia in 1830 new granada ecuador and venezuela colombia was the first constitutional government in south america and the liberal and conservative parties founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the americas slavery was abolished in the country in 1851 internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of gran colombia in 1830 the so-called department of cundinamarca adopted the name new granada

country finally became known as the republic of colombia internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars the most significant being the thousand days war 18991902 20th century the united states of americas intentions to influence the area especially the panama canal construction and control led to the separation of the department of panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation the united states paid colombia 25000000 in 1921 seven years after completion of the canal for redress of president roosevelts role in the creation of panama and colombia recognized panama under the terms of the thomsonurrutia treaty colombia and peru went to war because of territory disputes far in the amazon basin the war ended with a peace deal brokered by the league of nations the league finally awarded the disputed area to colombia in june 1934 soon after colombia achieved some degree of political stability which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s a period known as la violencia the violence its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the liberal presidential candidate jorge elicer gaitn on 9 april 1948 the ensuing riots in bogot known as el bogotazo spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180000 colombians colombia entered the korean war when laureano gmez was elected president it was the only latin american country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the united states particularly important was the resistance of the colombian troops at old baldy the violence between the two political parties decreased first when

conservative party and colombian liberal party agreed to create the national front a coalition which would jointly govern the country under the deal the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices the national front ended la violencia and national front administrations attempted
