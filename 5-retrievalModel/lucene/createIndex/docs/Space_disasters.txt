this article lists verifiable spaceflight-related accidents and incidents resulting in fatality or near-fatality during flight or training for manned space missions and testing assembly preparation or flight of manned and unmanned spacecraft not included are accidents or incidents associated with intercontinental ballistic missile icbm tests unmanned space flights not resulting in fatality or serious injury or soviet or german rocket-powered aircraft projects of world war ii also not included are alleged unreported soviet space accidents which are considered fringe theories by a majority of historians as of 2018 there have been 18 astronaut and cosmonaut fatalities during spaceflight astronauts have also died while training for space missions such as the apollo 1 launch pad fire which killed an entire crew of three there have also been some non-astronaut fatalities during spaceflight-related activities astronaut fatalities during spaceflight as of december2018 in-flight accidents have killed 18 astronauts in four separate incidents nasa astronauts who died on duty are memorialized at the space mirror memorial at the kennedy space center visitor complex in merritt island florida cosmonauts who died on duty under the soviet union were generally honored by burial at the kremlin wall necropolis in moscow no soviet or russian cosmonauts have died during spaceflight since 1971 there have been a total of five fatal in-flight accidents three of them flew above the krmn line and one was intended to do so in each case the entire crew was killed during training or testing in addition to accidents during spaceflights 13 astronauts test pilots and other personnel have been killed during training and test flights non-fatal incidents during spaceflight apart from actual disasters a number of missions resulted in some very near misses and also some training accidents that nearly resulted in deaths non-fatal incidents during training spaceflight-related accidents and incidents during assembly testing and preparation for flight of manned and unmanned spacecraft have occasionally resulted in injuries or the loss of craft since the earliest days of space programs

crashed into the indian river at cape canaveral florida cernan nearly drowned because he was not wearing a life vest and received some second-degree burns on his face and singed hair according to official reports at the time the crash was the result of mechanical failure later accounts written by cernan himself in an autobiography admit he was flying too low and showing off for nearby boaters the helicopter dipped a skid into the water and crashed james mcdivitt an apollo manager at the time demanded that cernan be removed from flight status and not be given command of apollo 17 cernan was

bergstrom afb austin tx he landed about 90 meters from the base operations building an electrical malfunction that caused loss of instruments during severe weather was listed by the review board as a major factor in the accident conrad was on a flight from dover de via dobbins afb ga to ellington afb houston tx due to bad weather he was diverted first to hobby airport houston because ellington afb was below minimums for landing while on final approach to hobby airport in darkness heavy rain and lightning the t-38 generator failed causing a loss of cockpit lighting and partial loss of navigation instruments conrad broke off the approach and tried to climb above the bad weather the generator was brought back online along with cockpit lighting because of the electrical problems he requested a diversion to an airport that was under visual flight rules controllers sent him toward randolph afb san antonio tx it soon became apparent the t-38 did not have enough fuel to reach randolph afb controllers then diverted him to bergstrom afb the t-38 ran out of fuel as it reached bergstron afb conrad ejected at 1100 meters the aircraft was destroyed he was taken to the base hospital for a routine examination and returned to houston later that night 1974 feb 6 t-38 jet landing mishap gear collapse astronaut dr karl g henize was involved in a landing mishap in his t-38 jet aircraft while

their t-38 jet aircraft the jet was on approach to los alamitos army air field ca when the right engine failed and caught fire there was smoke in the cockpit the crew chose to land the plane rather

hospital for observation and later released 1989 may 15 t-38 jet near midair collision with airliner astronaut david m walker was flying a nasa t-38 jet into dulles airport near washington dc for a presidential ceremony at about 8km 5mi from the airport at an altitude of 2100 meters he came within 150 meters of colliding with a pan am airbus 310 airliner he was later found at fault for the incident and suspended from flying for 60 days by nasa he was also removed as commander of the sts-44 mission 19901999 1993 may 3 emergency egress training broken bones in foot astronaut dr m rhea seddon broke four metatarsal bones in her left foot during emergency egress training from the johnson space center orbiter training facility she was using an inflatable slide similar to those used on

sts-101 mission james d halsell sprained his ankle climbing down steps inside of a space shuttle simulator at johnson space center houston this caused him to miss some training activities and delayed the launch of his mission by about a week 2003 dec 2 nasa gulfstream ii shuttle training aircraft - engine thrust reverser fell off aircraft in flight a nasa gulfstream ii shuttle training aircraft sta was flying a series of simulated shuttle landings to the kennedy space center shuttle landing facility on board the aircraft was an unidentified nasa astronaut pilot and two training personnel the aircraft was on final approach at 13000 feet when on-board instruments indicated a malfunction on one of the jet engine thrust reversers the aircraft landed safely a post-landing inspection showed that one of the 585-pound 4-foot-wide 5-foot-long thrust reversers had fallen off the aircraft divers later found the thrust reverser on the bottom of the nearby banana river an investigation showed that a bolt failed causing the part to fall off the aircraft 2003 dec 17 spaceshipone - landing accident ran off runway while piloting spaceshipone on its first powered test flight 11p astronaut brian binnie reached a peak altitude of 207km 13mi and exceeded the speed of sound upon landing spaceshipone experienced a roll oscillation that caused the left main gear to collapse the craft ran off the runway and rolled to a stop in soft sand the craft sustained minor damage later repaired and the pilot was uninjured 20102019 non-astronaut fatalities fatalities caused by rocket explosions this list excludes deaths caused by military operations either by deliberate detonations or accidental during production - for example german v-2 rockets reportedly caused on average an estimated 6 deaths per operational rocket just during its production stages other non-astronaut fatalities see also spaceflight portal spaceflight non-fatal training accidents criticism of the space shuttle program fallen
