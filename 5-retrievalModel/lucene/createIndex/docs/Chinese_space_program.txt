the space program of the peoples republic of china is directed by the china national space administration cnsa its technological roots can be traced back to the late 1950s when china began a ballistic missile program in response to perceived american and later soviet threats however the first chinese crewed space program only began several decades later when an accelerated program of technological development culminated in yang liweis successful 2003 flight aboard shenzhou5 this achievement made china the third country to independently send humans into space plans currently include a permanent chinese space station in 2020 and crewed expeditions to the moon officials have articulated long term ambitions to exploit earth-moon space for industrial development history and recent developments after the united states threatened to use nuclear weapons during the korean war chairman mao zedong decided that only a nuclear deterrent of its own would guarantee the security of the newly founded prc additionally he wanted china to gain status among the worlds powers thatas he feltdid not respect him from this he decided instead to only implement his new plan with the republic of china present-day taiwan as china thus mao announced his decision to develop chinas own strategic weapons including nuclear bombs and associated missiles for the warheads during a communist party of china cpc central committee meeting held on january 15 1955 the chinese nuclear weapons program was designated by the codename of 02 the fifth academy of the national defense ministry was founded on october 8 1956 with qian xuesen who had just been deported from the united states after being accused of being a communist during the red scare as director the academy started the development of the first ballistic missile program adopted on march 1 1956 and known as the first twelve-year-plan for chinese aerospace after the launch of mankinds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 by the soviet union on october 4 1957 mao decided during the national congress of the cpc on may 17 1958 to make china an equal with the superpowers we need to develop the artificial satellite too by adopting project 581 with the objective of placing a satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the prcs founding this goal would be achieved in three phases developing sounding rockets first then launching small satellites and in the final phase large satellites the construction of chinas first missile test base code-named base 20 started in april 1958 and it entered service on october 20 of the same year the first chinese missile was built in october 1958 as a reverse-engineered copy of the soviet r-2 short-range ballistic missile srbm itself an upgraded version of a german v-2 rocket its range was 590km weighing 205 tons and propelled with liquid oxygen and alcohol chinas first ever t-7 sounding rocket was successfully launched from the nanhui launch site on february 19 1960 china started to develop medium-range ballistic missiles mrbm in july 1960 with an increased range double that of the r-2 during the cordial sino-soviet relations of the 1950s the ussr engaged in a cooperative technology transfer program with the prc under which they trained chinese students and provided the fledgling program with a sample r-2 rocket but when soviet premier nikita khrushchev was denounced as revisionist with mao asserting that there had been a counter-revolution in the soviet union and that capitalism had been restored the friendly relationship between the two countries turned to confrontation as a consequence all soviet technological assistance was abruptly withdrawn after the 1960 sino-soviet split only 17 days after the last soviet expert had left china the first soviet built r-2 rocket fueled with chinese-made propellant was launched with success on september 10 1960 due to cold war tension mao decided in december 1963 that china should develop missile defence system capacity during a conference held on february 2 1964 directive 640 640was adopted later known as project 640 the first successful launch of a chinese 1059 srbm missile copy of the r-2 was conducted only two months later on november 5 1960 the missile was also designated df-1 the first df-2 mrbm was tested on march 21 1962 but failed development eventually continued with the redesigned df-2a mrbm which was successfully tested on june 29 1964 it would enter service by the end of 1966 the first successful launch and recovery of a t-7as1 sounding rocket carrying a biological experiment transporting eight white mice was on july 19 1964 from base 603 china started to develop the df-5 intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program in august 1965 it was designed to carry a single nuclear warhead and has a maximum range of 12000km in november 1966 it was decided to build a second ballistic missile test site the northern missile test site in shanxi province farther away from chinas northern border on october 27 1966 a nuclear-tipped df-2a missile was launched from jiuquan and the 20 kilotons yield nuclear warhead exploded at the height of 569 meters over the target in lop nor or base 21 situated 894km away on december 26 1966 china tested its first indigenously developed df-3 intermediate-range ballistic missile irbm with success the df-3 was a single-stage single-warhead missile with a maximum range of 2500km the development of the df-4 irbm began in 1967 in parallel with the single-stage df-3 in march 1967 development started on the jl-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile to accompany the type 092 ballistic missile submarine ssbn also in development as the space race between the two superpowers reached its climax with the conquest of the moon mao and zhou enlai decided on july 14 1967 that the prc should not be left behind and started chinas own crewed space program chinas first spacecraft designed for human occupancy was named shuguang-1 in january 1968 chinas space medical institute was founded on april 1 1968 and the central military commission issued the order to start the selection of astronauts as part of the third line effort to relocate critical defense infrastructure to the relatively remote interior away from the soviet border it was decided to construct a new space center in the mountainous region of xichang in the sichuan province code-named base 27 a first liquid-propellant df-3 medium-range ballistic missile was successfully launched from the northern missile test site on december 18 1968 inaugurating the test site in august 1969 the development of chinas first heavy-lift satellite launch vehicle slv the feng bao 1 fb-1 was started by shanghais 2nd bureau of mechanic-electrical industry the all-liquid two-stage launcher was derived from the df-5 icbm only a few months later a parallel heavy-lift slv program also based on the same df-5 icbm and known as cz-2 was started in beijing by the first space academy the df-4 was used to develop the long march-1 slv a newly designed spin-up orbital insertion solid propellant rocket motor third stage was added to the two existing nitric acidudmh liquid propellant stages an attempt to use this vehicle to launch a chinese satellite before japans first attempt ended in failure on november 16 1969 the first df-4 liquid-propellant with two-stage single-warhead irbm was tested with success on january 30 1970 the addition of a second-stage allowed the missile to increase its range to over 4750km the second satellite launch attempt on april 24 1970 was successful a cz-1 was used to launch the 173kg dong fang hong i meaning the east is red i also known as mao-1 it was the heaviest first satellite placed into orbit by a nation exceeding the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four previous countries the third stage of the cz-1 was specially equipped with a 40 m solar reflector deployed by the centrifugal force developed by the spin up orbital insertion solid propellant stage therefore the faint magnitude 5 to 8 brightness of the dfh-1 made the satellite at best barely visible with naked eyes was consequently dramatically increased to a comfortable magnitude 2 to 3 the prcs second satellite was launched with the last of the cz-1 slvs on march 3 1971 the 221kg shijian-1 sj-1 was equipped with a magnetometer and cosmic-rayx-ray detectors the first crewed space program known as project 714 was officially adopted in april 1971 with the goal of sending two astronauts into space by 1973 aboard the shuguang spacecraft the first screening process for astronauts had already ended on march 15 1971 with 19 astronauts chosen the program would soon be cancelled due to political turmoil a first flight test of the df-5 icbm was carried out in october 1971 on august 10 1972 the new heavy-lift slv fb-1 made its maiden test flight with only partial success the cz-2a launcher originally designed to carry the shuguang-1 spacecraft was first tested on november 5 1974 carrying chinas first fsw-0 recoverable satellite but failed after some redesign work the modified cz-2c successfully launched the fsw-0 no1 recoverable satellite into orbit on november 26 1975 after expansion the northern missile test site was upgraded as a test base in january 1976 to become the northern missile test base known as base 25 after mao died on september 9 1976 his rival deng xiaoping denounced during the cultural revolution as reactionary and therefore forced to retire from all his offices slowly re-emerged as chinas new leader in 1978 at first new development was slowed then several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelledthe fanji abm system the xianfeng anti-missile super gun the icbm early warning network 7010 tracking radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program nevertheless some development did proceed the first yuanwang-class space tracking ship was commissioned in 1979 the first full-range test of the df-5 icbm was conducted on may 18 1980 the payload reached its target located 9300km away in the south pacific 70s 11733e 7000s 117550e -7000 117550 df-5 icbm test impact and retrieved five minutes later by helicopter further development of the long march rocket series allowed the prc to initiate a commercial launch program in 1985 which has since launched over 30 foreign satellites primarily for european and asian interests the next crewed space program was even more ambitious and proposed in march 1986 as astronautics plan 863-2 this consisted of a crewed spacecraft project 863-204 used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station project 863-205 several spaceplane designs were rejected two years later and a simpler space capsule was chosen instead although the project did not achieve its goals it would ultimately evolve into the 1992 project 921 the ministry of aerospace industry was founded on july 5 1988 on september 15 1988 a jl-1 slbm was launched from a type 092 submarine the maximum range of the slbm is 2150km along dengs policy of capitalist reforms in the chinese economy chinese culture also changed therefore names used in the space program previously all chosen from the revolutionary history of the prc were soon replaced with mystical-religious ones thus new long march carrier rockets were renamed divine arrow spacecraft divine vessel space plane divine dragon land-based high-power laser divine light and supercomputer divine might in june 1993 china aerospace industry corporation national space bureau was founded in beijing on february 15 1996 during the flight of the first long march 3b heavy carrier rocket carrying intelsat 708 the rocket veered off course immediately after clearing the launch platform crashing 22 seconds later it crashed 185km 115mi away from the launch pad into a nearby mountain village on the 50th anniversary of the prcs founding china launched the shenzhou 1 spacecraft on november 20 1999 and recovered it after a flight of 21 hours the country became the third country with a successful crewed space program by sending an astronaut into space aboard shenzhou 5 on october 15 2003 for more than 21 hours china has since turned its focus to extraterrestrial exploration starting with the moon the first chinese lunar exploration program un-crewed lunar orbiter change 1 was successfully launched on october 24 2007 making china the fifth nation to successfully orbit the moon chinese space program and the international community dual-use technologies and outer space the prc is a member of the united nations committee on the peaceful uses of outer space and a signatory to all united nations treaties and conventions on space with the exception of the unpopular 1979 moon treaty the united states government has long been resistant to the use of prc launch services by american industry due to concerns over alleged civilian technology transfer that could have dual-use military applications to countries such as north korea iran or syria and announced an official embargo against the prc in 2000 thus financial retaliatory measures have been taken on many occasions against several chinese space companies chinese exclusion policy of nasa due to security concerns all researchers from the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa are prohibited from working with chinese citizens affiliated with a chinese state enterprise or entity in april 2011 the 112th united states congress banned nasa from using its funds to host chinese visitors at nasa facilities in march 2013 the us congress passed legislation barring chinese nationals from entering nasa facilities without a waiver from nasa the history of the us exclusion policy can be traced back in 1998 when a us congressional commission led by christopher cox discovered that the technical information that american companies provided china for its commercial satellite ended up improving chinese intercontinental ballistic missile technology this was further aggravated in 2007 when china blew up its space station in the low earth orbit to test a ground-based anti-satellite asat missile the debris created by the explosion contributed to the space junk that litter earths orbit exposing american military space assets at the risk such as accidental collision the united states also fears the chinese application of dual-use space technology for nefarious purposes the us imposed an embargo to the us - china space cooperation throughout the 2000s and by 2011 a clause inserted by then-congressman frank wolf in the 2011 us federal budget forbids nasa from hosting or participating in a joint scientific activity with china the chinese response to the exclusion policy involved its own space policy of opening up its space station to the outside world welcoming scientists coming from all countries american scientists have also boycotted nasa conferences due to its rejection of chinese nationals in these events organization initially the space program of the prc was organized under the peoples liberation army particularly the second artillery corps in the 1990s however the prc reorganized the space program as part of a general reorganization of the defense industry to make it resemble western defense procurement the china national space administration an agency within the commission of science technology and industry for national defense currently headed by sun laiyan is now responsible for launches the long march rocket is produced by the china academy of launch vehicle technology and satellites are produced by the china aerospace science and technology corporation the latter organizations are state-owned enterprises however it is the intent of the prc government that they should not be actively state managed and that they should behave much as private companies would in the west universities and institutes the space program also has close links with college of aerospace science and engineering national university of defense technology school of astronautics beihang university school of aerospace tsinghua university school of astronautics northwestern polytechnical university school of aeronautics and astronautics zhejiang university institute of aerospace science and

sites siziwang banner crewed spaceflight programs project 714 as the space race between the two superpowers reached its climax with humans landing on the moon mao zedong and zhou enlai decided on july 14 1967 that the prc should not be left behind and therefore initiated chinas own crewed space program the top-secret project 714 aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the shuguang spacecraft nineteen plaaf pilots were selected for this goal on march 1971 the shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the cz-2a rocket was designed to carry a crew of two the program was officially cancelled on may 13 1972 for economic reasons though the internal politics of the cultural revolution likely motivated the closure the short-lived second crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology third in the world after ussr and united states by fsw satellites it was announced a few times in 1978 with the open publishing of some details including photos but then was abruptly canceled in 1980 it has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes and was never intended to produce results project 863 a new crewed space program was proposed by the chinese academy of sciences in march 1986 as astronautics plan 863-2 this consisted of a crewed spacecraft project 863-204 used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station project 863-205 in september of that year astronauts in training were presented by the chinese media the various proposed crewed spacecraft were mostly spaceplanes project 863 ultimately evolved into the 1992 project 921 project 921 shenzhou spacecraft in 1992 authorization and funding was given for the first phase of project 921 which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft the shenzhou program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions the first one was shenzhou 1 on november 20 1999 on january 9 2001 shenzhou 2 launched carrying test animals shenzhou 3 and shenzhou 4 were launched in 2002 carrying test dummies following these was the successful shenzhou 5 chinas first crewed mission in space on october 15 2003 which carried yang liwei in orbit for 21 hours and made china the third nation to launch a human into orbit shenzhou 6 followed two years later ending the first phase of the project 921 missions are launched on the long march 2f rocket from the jiuquan satellite launch center the china crewed space engineering office provides engineering and administrative support for the crewed shenzhou missions space laboratory the second phase of the project 921 started with shenzhou 7 chinas first spacewalk mission then two crewed missions were planned to the first chinese space laboratory the prc initially designed the shenzhou spacecraft with docking technologies imported from russia therefore compatible with the international space station iss on september 29 2011 china launched tiangong 1 this target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station on october 31 2011 a long march 2f rocket lifted the shenzhou 8 uncrewed spacecraft which docked twice with the tiangong 1 module the shenzhou 9 craft took off on 16 june 2012 with a crew of 3 it successfully docked with the tiangong-1 laboratory on 18 june 2012 at 0607 utc marking chinas first manned spacecraft docking another manned mission shenzhou 10 launched on 11 june 2013 the tiangong 1 target module is then expected to be deorbited a second space lab tiangong 2 launched on 15 september 2016 220409 utc8 the launch mass was 8600 kg with a length of 104m and a width of 335m much like the tiangong 1 shenzhou 11 launched and rendezvoused with tiangong 2 in october 2016 with an unconfirmed further mission shenzhou 12 in the future the tiangong 2 brings with it the polar gamma ray burst detector a space-earth quantum key distribution and laser communications experiment to be used in conjunction with the mozi quantum science satellite a liquid bridge thermocapillary convection experiment and a space material experiment also included is a stereoscopic microwave altimeter a space plant growth experiment and a multi-angle wide-spectral imager and multi-spectral limb imaging spectrometer onboard tg-2 there will also be the worlds first-ever in-space cold atomic fountain clock space station a larger basic permanent space station would be the third and last phase of project 921 this will be a modular design with an eventual weight of around 60 tons to be completed sometime before 2020 the first section designated tiangong 3 is scheduled for launch after tiangong 2 tiangong 3 will weigh 22 tons and be 181 metres long additional modules will be connected over several missions to build the space station this could also be the beginning of chinas crewed international cooperation the existence of which was officially disclosed for the first time after the launch of shenzhou 7 the chinese space station is scheduled to be completed in 2020 proposed lunar exploration in february 2004 the prc formally started the implementation phase of its uncrewed moon exploration project according to sun laiyan administrator of the china national space administration the project will involve three phases orbiting the moon landing and returning samples the first phase planned to spend 14 billion renminbi approx us170 million to orbit a satellite around the moon before 2007 which is ongoing phase two involves sending a lander before 2010 phase three involves collecting lunar soil samples before 2020 on november 27 2005 the deputy commander of the crewed spaceflight program announced that the prc planned to complete a space station and a crewed mission to the moon by 2020 assuming funding was approved by the government on december 14 2005 it was reported an effort to launch lunar orbiting satellites will be supplanted in 2007 by a program aimed at accomplishing an uncrewed lunar landing a program to return uncrewed space vehicles from the moon will begin in 2012 and last for five years until the crewed program gets underway in 2017 with a crewed moon landing some time after that nonetheless the decision to develop a totally new moon rocket in the 1962 soviet ur-700m-class project aelita able to launch a 500-ton payload in lto and a more modest 50 tons lto payload lv has been discussed in a 2006 conference by academician zhang guitian a liquid propellant rocket engine specialist who developed the cz-2 and cz-4a rockets engines on june 22 2006 long lehao deputy chief architect of the lunar probe project laid out a schedule for chinas lunar exploration he set 2024 as the date of chinas first moonwalk in september 2010 it was announced that the country is planning to carry out explorations in deep space by sending a man to the moon by 2025 china also hopes to bring a moon rock sample back to earth in 2017 and subsequently build an observatory on the moons surface ye peijian commander in chief of the change programme and an academic at the chinese academy of sciences added that china has the full capacity to accomplish mars exploration by 2013 on january 3 2019 change 4 the china national space administrations lunar rover successfully landed on the far side of the moon the rover was able to transmit data back to earth despite the lack of radio frequencies on the far side via a dedicated satellite sent earlier to orbit the moon the landing and data transmission is considered a landmark achievement for human space exploration on december 14 2013 chinas change 3 became the first object to soft-land on the moon since luna 24 in 1976 as indicated by the official chinese lunar exploration program insignia denoted by a calligraphic moon ideogram in the shape of a nascent lunar crescent with two human footsteps at its center the ultimate objective of the program is to establish a permanent human presence on the earths natural satellite yang liwei declared at the 16th human in space symposium of international academy of astronautics iaa in beijing on may 22 2007 that building a lunar base was a crucial step to realize a flight to mars and farther planets according to practice since the whole project is only at a very early preparatory research phase no official crewed moon program has been announced yet by the authorities but its existence is nonetheless revealed by regular intentional leaks in the media a typical example is the lunar roving vehicle that was shown on a chinese tv channel during the 2008 may day celebrations mission to mars and beyond sun laiyan administrator of the china national space administration said on july 20 2006 that china would start deep space exploration focusing on mars over the next five years during the eleventh five-year plan 20062010 program period the first uncrewed mars exploration program could take place sometime between now and 2033 followed by a crewed phase in 2040-2060 the mars 500 study of 2011 prepared for this manned mission moreover in order to make crewed flight in deep space toward mars safer a space weather forecast system was to be completed by 2017 with the kuafu mission satellites placed at the lagrangian point l1 however due to withdrawal first by canada and then esa the project was indefinitely postponed in 2006 the chief designer of the shenzhou spacecraft stated in an interview that space-based solar power according to the china academy of space technology cast presentation at the 2015 international space development congress in toronto canada chinese interest in space-based solar power began in the period 19901995 by 2011 there was a proposal for a national program with advocates such as pioneer professor wang xiji stating in an article for the ministry of science and technology that china had built up a solid industrial foundation acquired sufficient technology and had enough money to carry out the most ambitious space project in history once completed the solar station with a capacity of 100mw would span at least one square kilometre dwarfing the international space station and becoming the biggest man-made object in space and warned that if it did not act quickly china would let other countries in particular the us and japan take the lead and occupy strategically important locations in space global security cites a 2011-01 journal of rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620 launches of their long march-9 cz-9 heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10000 mw capacity massing 50000 tonnes by 2013 there was a national goal that the state has decided that power coming from outside of the earth such as solar power and development of other space energy resources is to be chinas future direction and the following roadmap was identified in 2010 cast will finish the concept design in 2020 we will finish the industrial level testing of in-orbit construction and wireless transmissions in 2025 we will complete the first 100kw sps demonstration at leo and in 2035 the 100mw sps will have electric generating capacity finally in 2050 the first commercial level sps system will be in operation at geo the article went on to state that since sps development will be a huge project it will be considered the equivalent of an apollo program for energy in the last century americas leading position in science and technology worldwide was inextricably linked with technological advances associated with implementation of the apollo program likewise as chinas current achievements in aerospace technology are built upon with its successive generations of satellite projects in space china will use its capabilities in space science to assure sustainable development of energy from space in 2015 the cast team won the international sunsat design competition with their video of a multi-rotary joint concept the design was presented in detail in a paper for the online journal of space communication in 2016 lt gen zhang yulin deputy chief of the pla armament development department of the central military commission suggested that china would next begin to exploit earth-moon space for industrial development the goal would be the construction of space-based solar power satellites that would beam energy back to earth goals the china national space administration stated that their long-term goals are improve their standing in the world of space science establish a crewed space station crewed missions to the moon establish a crewed

of mars the yinghuo-1 orbiter was launched in november 2011 in the joint fobos-grunt mission with russia but the rocket failed to leave earth orbit and underwent destructive re-entry on 15 january 2012 further planned missions include rover landers and possible crewed missions in the far future deep space exploration roadmap in 2018 chinese researchers proposed a deep space exploration roadmap to explore mars an asteroid jupiter and further targets within the 2020-2030 timeframe proposed robotic missions include asteroid exploration mission proposed for launch around 2022-2024 mission goals include asteroid flyby observations global remote sensing unmanned landing and possible sample return mars sample return mission hx-2 proposed for launch around 2028-2030 mission goals include in-situ topography and soil composition analysis deep interior investigations to probe the planets origins and geologic evolution and sample return jupiter system exploration mission proposed for launch around 2029-2030 and arriving at jupiter around 2036 mission goals include orbital exploration of jupiter and its four largest moons study of the magnetohydrodynamics in the jupiter system and investigation of the internal composition of jupiters atmosphere and moons especially ganymede a mission to uranus though tentative has been proposed for implementation after 2030 with a probe arriving in the 2040s it is presumed to be part of a future planetary flyby phase of exploration and would study the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field as well these missions with the exception of the uranus mission have either been officially approved or are in the study phase as of june 2017 research the center for space science and applied research cssar was founded in 1987 by
