rayleigh scattering pronounced reli ray-lee named after the british physicist lord rayleigh john william strutt is the predominantly elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation rayleigh scattering does not change the state of material and is hence a parametric process the particles may be individual atoms or molecules it can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids and is most prominently seen in gases rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles the oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle causing them to move at the same frequency the particle therefore becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light this radiation is integral part of the photon and no excitation or deexcitation occurs rayleigh scattering of sunlight in earths atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation which is the reason for the blue color of the daytime and twilight sky as well as the yellowish to reddish hue of the low sun for wave frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering particle normal dispersion regime the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic contribution from rotational raman scattering in air since the changes in wavenumber of the scattered photon are typically smaller than 50cm this can lead to changes in the rotational state of the molecules furthermore the inelastic contribution has the same wavelengths dependency as the elastic part scattering by particles similar to or larger than the wavelength of light is typically treated by the mie theory the discrete dipole approximation and other computational techniques rayleigh scattering applies to particles that are small with respect to wavelengths of light and that are optically soft ie with a refractive index close to 1 on the other hand anomalous diffraction theory applies to optically soft but larger particles history in 1859 while attempting to determine whether any contaminants remained in the purified air he used for infrared experiments john tyndall discovered that bright light scattering off nanoscopic particulates was faintly blue-tinted he conjectured that a similar scattering of sunlight gave the sky its blue hue but he could not explain the preference for blue light nor could atmospheric dust explain the intensity of the skys color in 1871 lord rayleigh published two papers on the color and polarization of skylight to quantify tyndalls effect in water droplets in terms of the tiny particulates volumes and refractive indices in 1881 with the benefit of james clerk maxwells 1865 proof of the electromagnetic nature of light he showed that his equations followed from electromagnetism in 1899 he showed that they applied to individual molecules with terms containing particulate volumes and refractive indices replaced with terms for molecular polarizability small size parameter approximation the size of a scattering particle is often parameterized by the ratio where r is its characteristic length radius and is the wavelength of the light the amplitude of light scattered from within any transparent dielectric is proportional to the inverse square of its wavelength and to the volume of material that is to the cube of its characteristic length the wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any scattering mechanism objects with x 1 act as geometric shapes scattering light according to their projected area at the intermediate x 1 of mie scattering interference effects develop through phase variations over the objects surface rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small x 1 with a particle size 1 10 wavelength and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase because the particles are randomly positioned the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size in detail the intensity i of light scattered by any one of the small spheres of diameter d and refractive index n from a beam of unpolarized light of wavelength and intensity i0 is given by where r is the distance to the particle and is the scattering angle averaging this over all angles gives the rayleigh scattering cross-section the fraction of light scattered by a group of scattering particles is the number of particles per unit volume n times the cross-section for example the major constituent of the atmosphere nitrogen has a rayleigh cross section of 69695099999999999995110m at a wavelength of 532nm green light this means that at atmospheric pressure where there are about 7025200000000000000210 molecules per cubic meter about a fraction 10 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel the strong wavelength dependence of the scattering means that shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer red wavelengths from molecules the expression above can also be written in terms of individual molecules by expressing the dependence on refractive index in terms of the molecular polarizability proportional to the dipole moment induced by the electric field of the light in this case the rayleigh scattering intensity for a single particle is given in cgs-units by cause of the blue color of the sky the strong wavelength dependence of the scattering means that shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer red wavelengths this results in the indirect blue light coming from all regions of the sky rayleigh scattering is a good approximation of the manner in which light scattering occurs within various media for which scattering particles have a small size parameter a portion of the beam of light coming from the sun scatters off molecules of gas and other small particles in the atmosphere here rayleigh scattering primarily occurs through sunlights interaction with randomly located air molecules it is this scattered light that gives the surrounding sky its brightness and its color as previously stated rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength so that shorter wavelength violet and blue light will scatter more than the longer wavelengths yellow and especially red light however the sun like any star has its own spectrum and so i0 in the scattering formula above is not constant but falls away in the violet in addition the oxygen in the earths atmosphere absorbs wavelengths at the edge of the ultra-violet region of the spectrum the resulting color which appears like a pale blue actually is a mixture of all the scattered colors mainly blue and green conversely glancing toward the sun the colors that were not scattered away the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light are directly visible giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue viewed from space however the sky is black and the sun is white the reddening of the sun is intensified when it is near the horizon because the light being received directly from it must pass through more of the atmosphere the effect is further increased because the sunlight must pass through a greater proportion of the atmosphere nearer the earths surface where it is denser this removes a significant proportion of the shorter wavelength blue and medium wavelength green light from the direct path to the observer the remaining unscattered light is therefore mostly of longer wavelengths and appears more red some of the scattering can also be from sulfate particles for years after large plinian eruptions the blue cast of the sky is notably brightened by the persistent sulfate load of the stratospheric gases some works of the artist j m w turner may owe their vivid red colours to the eruption of mount tambora in his lifetime in locations with little light pollution the moonlit night sky is also blue because moonlight is reflected sunlight with a slightly lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the moon the moonlit sky is not perceived as blue however because at low light levels human vision comes mainly from rod cells that do not produce any color perception purkinje effect in optical fibers rayleigh scattering is an important component of the scattering of optical signals in optical fibers silica fibers are glasses disordered materials with microscopic variations of density and refractive index these give rise to energy losses due to the scattered light with the following coefficient where n is the refraction index p is the photoelastic coefficient of the glass k is the boltzmann constant and is the isothermal compressibility tf is a fictive temperature representing the temperature at which the density fluctuations are frozen in the material in porous materials rayleigh-type scattering can also be exhibited by porous materials an example is the strong optical scattering by nanoporous materials the strong contrast in refractive index between pores and solid parts of sintered alumina results in very strong scattering with light completely changing direction each five micrometers on average the -type scattering is caused by the nanoporous structure a narrow pore size distribution around 70nm obtained by sintering monodispersive alumina powder see also rayleigh sky model ricean fading optical phenomenon dynamic light
