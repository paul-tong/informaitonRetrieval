moonlight consists of mostly sunlight with little earthlight reflected from the parts of the moons surface where the suns light strikes illumination the intensity of moonlight varies greatly depending on its phase but even the full moon typically provides only about 00501lux illumination when the full moon is at perigee and viewed around upper culmination from the tropics the illuminance can reach up to 032lux from earth the apparent magnitude of the full moon is only about 380000 that of the sun the color of moonlight particularly around full moon appears bluish to the human eye compared to most artificial light sources due to the purkinje effect moonlight is not actually tinted blue and although moonlight is often referred to as silvery it has no inherent silvery quality the moons albedo is 0136 meaning only 136 of incident sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface moonlight generally hampers astronomical viewing so astronomers usually avoid observing sessions around full moon it takes approximately 126 seconds for moonlight to reach earths surface moonlight shines on the very large telescope moonlight shines on the very large telescope moonlight illuminates a lake and surroundings moonlight illuminates a lake and surroundings during a lunar eclipse the moon is colored red by indirect sunlight which earths atmosphere has scattered and refracted during a lunar eclipse the moon is colored red by indirect sunlight which earths atmosphere has scattered and refracted earthlight indirect sunlight reflected from earth illuminates the dim side of the moon while direct sunlight the bright side earthlight indirect sunlight reflected from earth illuminates the dim side of the moon while direct sunlight the bright side with manual exposure settings photographs taken in moonlight do not appear much different from those taken in daylight with manual exposure settings photographs taken in moonlight do not appear much different from those taken in daylight folklore in folklore moonlight sometimes has a harmful influence for example sleeping in the light of a full moon on certain nights was said to transform a person into a werewolf the light of the moon was thought to worsen the symptoms of lunatics and to sleep in moonlight could make one blind or mad nyctalopia night blindness caused by a lack of vitamin a was thought to be caused by sleeping in moonlight in the tropics moon blindness is a name for equine recurrent uveitis moonlight is no longer thought of as the cause in the 16th century moonmilk a soft white limestone precipitate found in caves was thought to be caused by the rays of the moon moonlight in art seaport by moonlight 1771 by claude joseph vernet seaport by moonlight 1771 by claude joseph vernet dovedale by moonlight 1784 by joseph wright of derby dovedale by moonlight 1784 by joseph wright of derby visitor to a moonlit churchyard 1790 by philip james de loutherbourg visitor to a moonlit churchyard 1790 by philip james de loutherbourg clair de lune sur le port de boulogne - seaport of boulogne by moonlight 1869 by douard manet clair de lune sur le port de boulogne - seaport of boulogne by moonlight 1869 by douard manet the starry night 1889 by vincent van gogh the starry night 1889 by vincent van gogh contemporary art in 2008 katie paterson produced an artwork titled light bulb to simulate moonlight it consists of 289 lightbulbs coated to produce a similar spectrum to the light of the full moon see also moon portal airglow daylight diffuse reflection earthlight astronomy scotobiology starlight night in paintings western art night in paintings eastern art phases of the moon at usno strange moonlight at sciencenasa moonlight brightness at lunarlight photography
