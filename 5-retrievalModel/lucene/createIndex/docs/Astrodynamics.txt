orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newtons laws of motion and law of universal gravitation it is a core discipline within space-mission design and control celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets moons and comets orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories including orbital maneuvers orbital plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers general relativity is a more exact theory than newtons laws for calculating orbits and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations eg orbits near the sun history until the rise of space travel in the twentieth century there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics at the time of sputnik the field was termed space dynamics the fundamental techniques such as those used to solve the keplerian problem determining position as a function of time are therefore the same in both fields furthermore the history of the fields are almost entirely shared johannes kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy publishing his laws in 1605 isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophi naturalis principia mathematica 1687 which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabolic path from three observations this was used by edmund halley to establish the orbits of various comets including that which bears his name newtons method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by euler in 1744 whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by lambert in 1761-1777 another milestone in orbit determination was carl friedrich gausss assistance in the recovery of the dwarf planet ceres in 1801 gausss method was able to use just three observations in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in gps receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets practical techniques rules of thumb the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun keplers laws of planetary motion orbits are elliptical with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse special case of this is a circular orbit a circle is a special case of ellipse with the planet at the center a line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times no matter which portion of the orbit is measured the square of a satellites orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet orbits are elliptical with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse special case of this is a circular orbit a circle is a special case of ellipse with the planet at the center a line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times no matter which portion of the orbit is measured the square of a satellites orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet without applying force such as firing a rocket engine the period and shape of the satellites orbit wont change a satellite in a low orbit or low part of an elliptical orbit moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit or a high part of an elliptical orbit due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet if thrust is applied at only one point in the satellites orbit it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit though the rest of its path will change thus one cannot move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust from a circular orbit thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellites motion changes orbit to elliptical the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point the periapse at 180 degrees away from the firing point then it will ascend back thrust applied in the direction of the satellites motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point apoapse 180 degrees away from the firing point the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive for example if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock unless they are very close the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to go faster this will change the shape of its orbit causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft missing the target the space rendezvous before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods requiring hours or even days to complete to the degree that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold actual trajectories will vary from those calculated for example simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low earth orbit these rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass such as a binary star system see n-body problem celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations keplers laws of planetary motion which can be mathematically derived from newtons laws hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important laws of astrodynamics the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newtons law of universal gravitation and newtons laws of motion while the fundamental mathematical tool is his differential calculus every orbit and trajectory outside atmospheres is in principle reversible ie in the space-time function the time is reversed the velocities are reversed and the accelerations are the same including those due to rocket bursts thus if a rocket burst is in the direction of the velocity in the reversed case it is opposite to the velocity of course in the case of rocket bursts there is no full reversal of events both ways the same delta-v is used and the same mass ratio applies standard assumptions in astrodynamics include non-interference from outside bodies negligible mass for one of the bodies and negligible other forces such as from the solar wind atmospheric drag etc more accurate calculations can be made without these simplifying assumptions but they are more complicated the increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile keplers laws of planetary motion may be derived from newtons laws when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor when an engine thrust or propulsive force is present newtons laws still apply but keplers laws are invalidated when the thrust stops the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by keplers laws the three laws are the orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the foci a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time the squares of the orbital periods of planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axis of the orbits escape velocity the formula for an escape velocity is easily derived as follows the specific energy energy per unit mass of any space vehicle is composed of two components the specific potential energy and the specific kinetic energy the specific potential energy associated with a planet of mass m is given by while the specific kinetic energy of an object is given by since energy is conserved and so the total specific orbital energy does not depend on the distance r displaystyle r from the center of the central body to the space vehicle in question therefore the object can reach infinite r displaystyle r only if this quantity is nonnegative which implies the escape velocity from the earths surface is about 11kms but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the sun to escape the solar system from a location at a distance from the sun equal to the distance sunearth but not close to the earth requires around 42kms velocity but there will be part credit for the earths orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from earth if their further acceleration due to the propulsion system carries them in the same direction as earth travels in its orbit formulae for free orbits orbits are conic sections so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in polar coordinates which is displaystyle mu is called the gravitational parameter m 1 displaystyle m1 and m 2 displaystyle m2 are the masses of objects 1 and 2 and h displaystyle h is the specific angular momentum of object 2 with respect to object 1 the parameter displaystyle theta is known as the true anomaly p displaystyle p is the semi-latus rectum while e displaystyle e is the orbital eccentricity all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent orbital elements circular orbits all bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature a special case of this is the circular orbit which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity the formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance r from the center of gravity of mass m can be derived as follows - centrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity so v 2 r g m r 2 displaystyle v2rgmr2 therefore where g displaystyle g is the gravitational constant equal to to properly use this formula the units must be consistent for example m displaystyle m must be in kilograms and r displaystyle r must be in meters the answer will be in meters per second the quantity g m displaystyle gm is often termed the standard gravitational parameter which has a different value for every planet or moon in the solar system once the circular orbital velocity is known the escape velocity is easily found by multiplying by the square root of 2 to escape from gravity the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy so 1 2 m v 2 g m m r displaystyle 12mv2gmmr and therefore elliptical orbits if 0 e 1 displaystyle 0e1 then the denominator of the equation of free orbits varies with the true anomaly displaystyle theta but remains positive never becoming zero therefore the relative position vector remains bounded having its smallest magnitude at periapsis r p displaystyle rp which is given by the maximum value r displaystyle r is reached when 180 displaystyle theta 180circ this point is called the apoapsis and its radial coordinate denoted r a displaystyle ra is let 2 a displaystyle 2a be the distance measured along the apse line from periapsis p displaystyle p to apoapsis a displaystyle a as illustrated in the equation below substituting the equations above we get a is the semimajor axis of the ellipse solving for p displaystyle p and substituting the result in the conic section curve formula above we get orbital period under standard assumptions the orbital period t displaystyle t of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as where displaystyle mu is standard gravitational parameter a displaystyle a is length of semi-major axis conclusions the orbital period is equal to that for a circular orbit with the orbit radius equal to the semi-major axis a displaystyle a for a given semi-major axis the orbital period does not depend on the eccentricity see also keplers third law velocity under standard assumptions the orbital speed v displaystyle v of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the vis-viva equation as where displaystyle mu is the standard gravitational parameter r displaystyle r is the distance between the orbiting bodies a displaystyle a is the length of the semi-major axis the velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory has either 1 a displaystyle 1 over a or it is the same with the convention that in that case a is negative energy under standard assumptions specific orbital energy displaystyle epsilon of elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation the vis-viva equation for this orbit can take the form where v displaystyle v is the speed of the orbiting body r displaystyle r is the distance of the orbiting body from the center of mass of the central body a displaystyle a is the semi-major axis displaystyle mu is the standard gravitational parameter conclusions for a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity using the virial theorem we find the time-average of the specific potential energy is equal to 2 the time-average of r is a the time-average of r is a the time-average of the specific kinetic energy is equal to - parabolic orbits if the eccentricity equals 1 then the orbit equation becomes where r displaystyle r is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the mass center of the central body h displaystyle h is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body displaystyle theta is the true anomaly of the orbiting body displaystyle mu is the standard gravitational parameter as the true anomaly approaches 180 the denominator approaches zero so that r tends towards infinity hence the energy of the trajectory for which e1 is zero and is given by where v displaystyle v is the speed of the orbiting body in other words the speed anywhere on a parabolic path is hyperbolic orbits if e 1 displaystyle e1 the orbit formula describes the geometry of the hyperbolic orbit the system consists of two symmetric curves the orbiting body occupies one of them the other one is its empty mathematical image clearly the denominator of the equation above goes to zero when cos 1 e displaystyle cos theta -1e we denote this value of true anomaly since the radial distance approaches infinity as the true anomaly approaches displaystyle theta infty known as the true anomaly of the asymptote observe that displaystyle theta infty lies between 90 and 180 from the trigonometric identity sin 2 cos 2 1 displaystyle sin 2theta cos 2theta 1 it follows that energy under standard assumptions specific orbital energy displaystyle epsilon of a hyperbolic trajectory is greater than zero and the orbital energy conservation equation for this kind of trajectory takes form where v displaystyle v is the orbital velocity of orbiting body r displaystyle r is the radial distance of orbiting body from central body a displaystyle a is the negative semi-major axis of the orbits hyperbola displaystyle mu is standard gravitational parameter hyperbolic excess velocity under standard assumptions the body traveling along a hyperbolic trajectory will attain at r displaystyle r infinity an orbital velocity called hyperbolic excess velocity v displaystyle vinfty that can be computed as where displaystyle mu is standard gravitational parameter a displaystyle a is the negative semi-major axis of orbits hyperbola the hyperbolic excess velocity is related to the specific orbital energy or characteristic energy by calculating trajectories keplers equation one approach to calculating orbits mainly used historically is to use keplers equation where m is the mean anomaly e is the eccentric anomaly and displaystyle displaystyle epsilon is the eccentricity with keplers formula finding the time-of-flight to reach an angle true anomaly of displaystyle theta from periapsis is broken into two steps compute the eccentric anomaly e displaystyle e from true anomaly displaystyle theta compute the time-of-flight t displaystyle t from the eccentric anomaly e displaystyle e finding the eccentric anomaly at a given time the inverse problem is more difficult keplers equation is transcendental in e displaystyle e meaning it cannot be solved for e displaystyle e algebraically keplers equation can be solved for e displaystyle e analytically by inversion a solution of keplers equation valid for all real values of displaystyle

displaystyle e and solve for time-of-flight then adjust e displaystyle e as necessary to bring the computed time-of-flight closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved usually newtons method is used to achieve relatively fast convergence the main difficulty with this approach is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits for near-parabolic orbits eccentricity displaystyle epsilon is nearly 1 and plugging e 1 displaystyle e1 into the formula for mean anomaly e sin e displaystyle e-sin e we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values and accuracy suffers for near-circular orbits it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all furthermore the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits these difficulties are what led to the development of the universal variable formulation described below conic orbits for simple procedures such as computing the delta-v for coplanar transfer ellipses traditional approaches are fairly effective others such as time-of-flight are far more complicated especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits the patched conic approximation the hohmann transfer orbit alone is a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets own gravity planetary gravity dominates the behaviour of the spacecraft in the vicinity of a planet and in most cases hohmann severely overestimates delta-v and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings a relatively simple way to get a first-order approximation of delta-v is based on the patched conic approximation technique one must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass and to model only that bodys effects in that region for instance on a trajectory from the earth to mars one would begin by considering only the earths gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the earths gravity no longer dominates that of the sun the spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space next one would consider only the suns gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighbourhood of mars during this stage the transfer orbit model is appropriate finally only marss gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where marss gravity dominates the spacecrafts behaviour the spacecraft would approach mars on a hyperbolic orbit and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by mars the size of the neighborhoods or spheres of influence vary with radius r s o i displaystyle rsoi where a p displaystyle ap is the semimajor axis of the planets orbit relative to the sun m p displaystyle mp and m s displaystyle ms are the masses of the planet and sun respectively this simplification is sufficient to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements and rough time-of-flight estimates but it is not generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination for that numerical methods are required the universal variable formulation to address computational shortcomings of traditional approaches for solving the 2-body problem the universal variable formulation was developed it works equally well for the circular elliptical parabolic and hyperbolic cases the differential equations converging well when integrated for any orbit it also generalizes well to problems incorporating perturbation theory perturbations the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique except now instead of the six keplerian orbital elements we use a different set of orbital elements namely the satellites initial position and velocity vectors x 0 displaystyle x0 and v 0 displaystyle v0 at a given epoch t 0 displaystyle t0 in a two-body simulation these elements are sufficient to compute the satellites position and velocity at any time in the future using the universal variable formulation conversely at any moment in the satellites orbit we can measure its position and velocity and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch in perfect two-body motion these orbital elements would be invariant just like the keplerian elements would be however perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time hence we write the position element as x 0 t displaystyle x0t and the velocity element as v 0 t displaystyle v0t indicating that they vary with time the technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions either exact or approximate for the functions x 0 t displaystyle x0t and v 0 t displaystyle v0t the following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical earth most of them can be handled on short timescales perhaps less than a few thousand orbits by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects equatorial bulges cause precession of the node and the perigee tesseral harmonics of the gravity field introduce additional perturbations lunar and solar gravity perturbations alter the orbits atmospheric drag reduces the semi-major axis unless make-up thrust is used over very long timescales perhaps millions of orbits even small perturbations can dominate and the behaviour can become chaotic on the other hand the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks such as station-keeping ground track maintenance or adjustment or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude orbital maneuver in spaceflight an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft for spacecraft far from earthfor example those in orbits around the sunan orbital maneuver is called a deep-space maneuver dsm orbital transfer transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one usually substantially circular orbit to another usually they require a burn at the start a burn at the end and sometimes one or more burns in the middle the hohmann transfer orbit requires a minimal delta-v a bi-elliptic transfer can require less energy than the hohmann transfer if the ratio of orbits is 1194 or greater but comes at the cost of increased trip time over the hohmann transfer faster transfers may use any orbit that intersects both the original and destination orbits at the cost of higher delta-v using low thrust engines such as electrical propulsion if the initial orbit is supersynchronous to the final desired circular orbit then the optimal transfer orbit is achieved by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee this method however takes much longer due to the low thrust for the case of orbital transfer between non-coplanar orbits the change-of-plane thrust must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect the node as the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest however a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change this works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one resulting in the small plane change being effectively free despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse as the oberth effect due to the increased slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis gravity assist and the oberth effect in a gravity assist a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction at a different speed this is useful to speed or slow a spacecraft instead of carrying more fuel this maneuver can be approximated by an elastic collision at large distances though the flyby does not involve any physical contact due to newtons third law equal and opposite reaction any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet or vice versa however because the planet is much much more massive than the spacecraft the effect on the planets orbit is negligible the oberth effect can be employed particularly during a gravity assist operation this effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body this can multiply the effective delta-v interplanetary transport network and fuzzy orbits it is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the solar system for example it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars passing close to one of the earths trojan points collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network these highly perturbative even chaotic orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections the biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow taking many years in addition launch windows can be very far apart they have however been employed on projects such as genesis this spacecraft visited the earth-sun l1 point and returned using very little propellant see also spaceflight portal aerodynamics aerospace engineering astrophysics canonical units
