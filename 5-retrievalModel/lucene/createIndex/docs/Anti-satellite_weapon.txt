anti-satellite weapons asat are space weapons designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic military purposes several nations possess operational asat systems with others in development or design although no asat system has yet been utilised in warfare several nations have shot down their own defunct satellites to demonstrate their asat capabilities in a show of force history the development and design of anti-satellite weapons has followed a number of paths the initial efforts by the usa and the ussr were using ground-launched missiles from the 1950s many more exotic proposals came afterwards us programs in the late 1950s the us air force started a series of advanced strategic missile projects under the designation weapon system ws-199a one of the projects studied under the 199a umbrella was martins bold orion air-launched ballistic missile albm for the b-47 stratojet based on the rocket motor from the sergeant missile twelve test launches were carried out between 26 may 1958 and 13 october 1959 but these were generally unsuccessful and further work as an albm ended the system was then modified with the addition of an altair upper stage to create an anti-satellite weapon with an 1100-mile 1700-km range only one test flight of the anti-satellite mission was carried out making a mock attack on the explorer 6 at an altitude of 156 miles 251km to record its flight path the bold orion transmitted telemetry to the ground ejected flares to aid visual tracking and was continuously tracked by radar the missile successfully passed within 4 miles 64km of the satellite which would be suitable for use with a nuclear weapon but useless for conventional warheads a similar project carried out under 199a lockheeds high virgo was initially another albm for the b-58 hustler likewise based on the sergeant it too was adapted for the anti-satellite role and made an attempted intercept on explorer 5 on 22 september 1959 however shortly after launch communications with the missile were lost and the camera packs could not be recovered to see if the test was successful in any event work on the ws-199 projects ended with the start of the gam-87 skybolt project simultaneous us navy projects were also abandoned although smaller projects did continue until the early 1970s the use of high altitude nuclear explosions to destroy satellites was considered after the tests of the first conventional missile systems in the 1960s during the hardtack teak test in 1958 observers noted the damaging effects of the electromagnetic pulse emp caused by the explosions on electronic equipment and during the starfish prime test in 1962 the emp from a 14 mt warhead detonated over the pacific damaged three satellites and also disrupted power transmission and communications across the pacific further testing of weapons effects was carried out under the dominic i series an adapted version of the nuclear armed nike zeus was used for an asat from 1962 codenamed mudflap the missile was designated dm-15s and a single missile was deployed at the kwajalein atoll until 1966 when the project was ended in favour of the usaf thor-based program 437 asat which was operational until 6 march 1975 another area of research was directed into energy weapons including a nuclear-explosion powered x-ray laser proposal developed at lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in 1968 other research was based on more conventional lasers or masers and developed to include the idea of a satellite with a fixed laser and a deployable mirror for targeting llnl continued to consider more edgy technology but their x-ray laser system development was cancelled in 1977 although research into x-ray lasers was resurrected during the 1980s as part of the sdi asats were generally given low priority until 1982 when information about a successful ussr program became widely known in the west a crash program followed which developed into the vought asm-135 asat based on the agm-69 sram with an altair upper stage the system was carried on a modified f-15 eagle that carried the missile directly under the central line of the plane the f-15s guidance system was modified for the mission and provided new directional cueing through the pilots head-up display and allowed for mid-course updates via a data link the first launch of the new anti-satellite missile took place in january 1984 the first and only successful interception was on september 13 1985 the f-15 took off from edwards air force base climbed to 38100 feet 11613m and vertically launched the missile at the solwind p78-1 a us gamma ray spectroscopy satellite orbiting at 555km 345mi which was launched in 1979 although successful the program was cancelled in 1988 on february 21 2008 the us navy destroyed the malfunctioning us spy satellite usa-193 using a ship-fired rim-161 standard missile 3 soviet union the origins of the soviet anti-satellite weapon program are unclear according to some accounts sergei korolev started some work on the concept in 1956 at his okb-1 while others attribute the work to vladimir chelomeis okb-52 around 1959 what is certain is that at the beginning of april 1960 nikita khrushchev held a meeting at his summer residence in crimea discussing an array of defense industry issues here chelomei outlined his rocket and spacecraft program and received a go-ahead to start development of the ur-200 rocket one of its many roles being the launcher for his anti-satellite project the decision to start work on the weapon was made in march 1961 as the istrebitel sputnik is lit fighter satellite the is system was co-orbital approaching its target over time and then exploding a shrapnel warhead close enough to kill it the missile was launched when a target satellites ground track rises above the launch site once the satellite is detected the missile is launched into orbit close to the targeted satellite it takes 90 to 200 minutes or one to two orbits for the missile interceptor to get close enough to its target the missile is guided by an onboard radar the interceptor which weighs 1400kg may be effective up to one kilometer from a target delays in the ur-200 missile program prompted chelomei to request r-7 rockets for prototype testing of the is two such tests were carried out on november 1 1963 and april 12 1964 later in the year khrushchev cancelled the ur-200 in favor of the r-36 forcing the is to switch to this launcher whose space launcher version was developed as the tsyklon-2 delays in that program led to the introduction of a simpler version the 2a which launched its first is test on october 27 1967 and a second on april 28 1968 further tests carried out against a special target spacecraft the ds-p1-m which recorded hits by the is warheads shrapnel a total of 23 launches have been identified as being part of the is test series the system was declared operational in february 1973 the worlds first successful intercept was completed in february 1970 the first successful test the second overall achieved 32 hits each could penetrate 100mm of armor testing resumed in 1976 as a result of the us work on the space shuttle elements within the soviet space industry convinced leonid brezhnev that the shuttle was a single-orbit weapon that would be launched from vandenberg air force base maneuver to avoid existing anti-ballistic missile sites bomb moscow in a first strike and then land although the soviet military was aware these claims were false brezhnev believed them and ordered a resumption of is testing along with a shuttle of their own as part of this work the is system was expanded to allow attacks at higher altitudes and was declared operational in this new arrangement on july 1 1979 however in 1983 yuri andropov ended all is testing and all attempts to resume it failed ironically it was at about this point that the us started its own testing in response to the soviet program the soviet union also experimented with large ground-based asat lasers from the 1970s onwards see terra-3 with a number of us spysats reportedly being blinded temporarily during the 1970s and 1980s the ussr had also researched directed energy weapons under the fon project from 1976 but the technical requirements needed of the high-powered gas dynamic lasers and neutral or charged particle beam systems seemed to be beyond reach in the early 1980s the soviet union also started developing a counterpart to the us air-launched asat system using modified mig-31d foxhounds at least six of which were completed as the launch platform system was called 30p6 kontakt the missile used is 79m6 the ussr also experimented with almaz military space stations arming them with fixed rikhter r-23 autocannons one last soviet design worth mentioning is 11f19dm skif-dmpolyus an orbital battlestation with a megawatt-range laser that failed on launch in 1987 in 1987 mikhail gorbachev visited baikonur cosmodrome and was shown an anti-satellite system called naryad sentry also known as 14f11 launched by ur-100n rockets asat in the era of strategic defense the era of the strategic defense initiative proposed in 1983 focused primarily on the development of systems to defend against nuclear warheads however some of the technologies developed may be useful also for anti-satellite use after the soviet union collapsed there were proposals to use this aircraft as a launch platform for lofting commercial and science packages into orbit recent political developments see below may have seen the reactivation of the russian air-launched asat program although there is no confirmation of this as yet the strategic defense initiative gave the us and soviet asat programs a major boost asat projects were adapted for abm use and the reverse was also true the initial us plan was to use the already-developed mhv as the basis for a space based constellation of about 40 platforms deploying up to 1500 kinetic interceptors by 1988 the us project had evolved into an extended four stage development the initial stage would consist of the brilliant pebbles defense system a satellite constellation of 4600 kinetic interceptors ke asat of 100lb 45kg each in low earth orbit and their associated tracking systems the next stage would deploy the larger platforms and the following phases would include the laser and charged particle beam weapons that would be developed by that time from existing projects such as miracl the first stage was intended to be completed by 2000 at a cost of around 125 billion research in the us and the soviet union was proving that the requirements at least for orbital based energy weapon systems were with available technology close to impossible nonetheless the strategic implications of a possible unforeseen breakthrough in technology forced the ussr to initiate massive spending on research in the 12th five year plan drawing all the various parts of the project together under the control of gukos and matching the us proposed deployment date of 2000 ultimately the soviet union approached the point of experimental implementation of orbital laser platforms with the failed launch of polyus both countries began to reduce expenditure from 1989 and the russian federation unilaterally discontinued all sdi research in 1992 research and development both of asat systems and other space baseddeployed weapons has however reported to have been resumed under the government of vladimir putin as a counter to renewed us strategic defense efforts post anti-ballistic missile treaty however the status of these efforts or indeed how they are being funded through national reconnaissance office projects of record remains unclear the us has begun working on a number of programs which could be foundational for a space-based asat these programs include the experimental spacecraft system usa-165 the near field infrared experiment nfire and the space-based interceptor sbi recent asats china at 528pm est january 11 2007 the peoples republic of china successfully destroyed a defunct chinese weather satellite fy-1c the destruction was reportedly carried out by an sc-19 asat missile with a kinetic kill warhead similar in concept to the american exoatmospheric kill vehicle fy-1c was a weather satellite orbiting earth in polar orbit at an altitude of about 865km 537mi with a mass of about 750kg 1650lb launched in 1999 it was the fourth satellite in the feng yun series the missile was launched from a mobile transporter-erector-launcher tel vehicle at xichang 281449n 1020130e 28247n 102025e 28247 102025 xichang satellite launch center and the warhead destroyed the satellite in a head-on collision at an extremely high relative velocity evidence suggests that the same sc-19 system was also tested in 2005 2006 2010 and 2013 although none of those events created any long-lived orbital debris in may 2013 the chinese government announced the launch of a suborbital rocket carrying a scientific payload to study the upper ionosphere however us government sources described it as the first test of a new ground-based asat system an open source analysis based in part on commercial satellite imagery found that it may indeed have been a test of a new asat system that could potentially threaten us satellites in geostationary earth orbit similarly on 5 february 2018 china tested an exoatmospheric ballistic missile with the potential to be used as an asat weapon the dong neng-3 with state media reporting that the test was purely defensive and it achieved its desired objectives united states usa-193 was an american reconnaissance satellite which was launched on 14 december 2006 by a delta ii rocket from vandenberg air force base it was reported about a month after launch that the satellite had failed in january 2008 it was noted that the satellite was decaying from orbit at a rate of 1640 feet 500m per day on 14 february 2008 it was reported that the united states navy had been instructed to fire an rim-161 standard missile 3 abm weapon at it to act as an anti-satellite weapon according to the us government the primary reason for destroying the satellite was the approximately 1000lb 450kg of toxic hydrazine fuel contained on board which could pose health risks to persons in the immediate vicinity of the crash site should any significant amount survive the re-entry on february 20 2008 it was announced that the launch was carried out successfully and an explosion was observed consistent with the destruction of the hydrazine fuel tank experts debated whether the hydrazine tank would have survived an uncontrolled reentry however if it had any human fatality would still have been very unlikely although hydrazine is toxic a small dose would not have been immediately lethal the chance of the assumed intact hydrazine tank landing close enough to at least one person for that person to be killed if he or she lingered in the vicinity of the crash site was about one percent while the cost of the intercept was about 100 million russia the successful flight test of russias direct ascent anti-satellite missile known as pl-19 nudol took place nov 18 2015 according to defense officials familiar with reports of the test in may 2016 russia tested the nudol for the second time it was launched from the plesetsk cosmodrome test launch facility located 500 miles 800km north of moscow three more launches were reportedly held in december 2016 in march 26 2018 and in december 23 2018 - the latter two from a tel a new type of asat missile was seen carried by a mig-31 in september 2018 limits of asats while it has been suggested that a country intercepting the satellites of another country in a conflict namely between china and the united states could seriously hinder the latters military operations the ease of shooting down orbiting satellites and their effects on operations has been questioned although satellites have been successfully intercepted at low orbiting altitudes the tracking of military satellites for a length of time would be less accurate than previous commercial or defective intercepts that did not employ any defensive measure like simple inclination changes depending on the level of tracking capabilities the interceptor would have to pre-determine the point of impact while compensating for the satellites lateral movement and the time for the interceptor to climb and move us intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr satellites orbit at about 800km 500mi high and move at 75kms 47mis so a chinese intermediate-range ballistic missile would need to compensate for 1350km 840mi of movement in the three minutes it takes to boost to that altitude even if an isr satellite is knocked out the us possesses an extensive array of manned and unmanned isr aircraft that could perform missions at standoff ranges from chinese land-based air defenses making them somewhat higher priority targets that would consume fewer resources to better engage global positioning system and communications satellites orbit at higher altitudes of 20000km 12000mi and 36000km 22000mi respectively putting them out of range of solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles liquid-fueled space launch vehicles could reach those altitudes but they are more time-consuming to launch and could be attacked on the ground before being able to launch in rapid succession the constellation of 30 gps satellites provides redundancy where at least four satellites can be received in six orbital planes at any one time so an attacker would need to disable at least six satellites to disrupt the network even if this is achieved signal degradation only lasts for 95 minutes leaving little time to take much decisive action and backup inertial navigation systems ins would still be available for relatively accurate movement as well as laser guidance for weapons targeting for communications the naval telecommunications system nts used by the us navy uses three elements tactical communications among a battle group long-haul communications between shore-based forward naval communications stations navcomstas and deployed afloat units and strategic communication connecting navcomstas with national command authorities nca the first two elements use line-of-sight 2530km 1316nmi 1619mi and extended line-of-sight 300500km 160270nmi 190310mi radios respectively so only strategic communications are dependent on satellites china would prefer to cut off deployed units from each other and then negotiate with the nca to have the battle group withdraw or stand down but asats could only achieve the opposite even if somehow a communications satellite were hit a battle group could still perform its missions in the absence of direct guidance from the nca asat development israel the arrow 3 or hetz 3 is an anti-ballistic missile currently in service it provides exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles it is also believed by experts such as prof yitzhak ben yisrael chairman of the israel space agency that it will operate as an asat india in a televised press briefing during the 97th indian science congress in thiruvananthapuram the defence research and development organisation director general rupesh announced that india was developing the necessary technology that could be combined to produce a weapon to destroy enemy satellites in orbit on february 10 2010 defence research and development organisation director-general and scientific advisor to the defence minister dr vk saraswat stated that india had all the building blocks necessary to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralize hostile satellites in low earth and polar orbits india is known to have been developing an exo-atmospheric kill vehicle that can be integrated with the missile to engage satellites russia in the early 1980s the soviet union had developed two mig-31d foxhounds as a launch platform for a potential vympel anti-satellite weapon system after the collapse of the soviet union this project was put on hold due to reduced defense expenditures however in august 2009 the russian air force had announced the resumption of this program further reports in may 2010 based on statements from col eduard sigalov in russias air and space defense forces indicated that russia was developing a fundamentally new weapon that can destroy potential targets in space the sokol eshelon is a prototype
