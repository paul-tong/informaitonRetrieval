ophiuchus fijuks is a large constellation straddling the celestial equator its name is from the greek ophioukhos serpent-bearer and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake unicode u26ce the serpent is represented by the constellation serpens ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer ptolemy and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations it was formerly referred to as serpentarius srpntris and anguitenens location ophiuchus figures between aquila serpens and hercules northwest of the center of the milky way the southern part lies between scorpius to the west and sagittarius to the east in the northern hemisphere it is best visible in summer it is opposite orion ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation serpens into two parts serpens caput and serpens cauda which are in modern times taken with ophiuchus as one constellation ophiuchus straddles the equator but lies predominantly to its south to wit rasalhague a fairly conspicuous star in its north never dips below the plane of potential visibility ignoring the suns presence in this constellation in november so is circumpolar north of 173456 declination the constellation extends southward to 30 declination segments of the ecliptic that lie within ophiuchus lie south of 20 declination a determination of exactly where these stars are visible on earth would depend on atmospheric refraction the novaya zemlya effect mountains and clouds in contrast to orion it is in the period novemberjanuary summer in the southern hemisphere winter in the northern hemisphere when ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes however for much of the arctic circle in the northern hemispheres winter months the sun is below the horizon even at midday stars and thus parts of ophiuchus especially rasalhague are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon low in the south in the northern hemispheres spring and summer months when ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky the constellation is actually not visible at those times and places in the arctic when midnight sun obscures the stars in countries close to the equator ophiuchus appears overhead in june around midnight and in the october evening sky features stars the brightest stars in ophiuchus include ophiuchi called rasalhague head of the serpent charmer at magnitude 207 and ophiuchi known as sabik the preceding one at magnitude 243 other bright stars in the constellation include ophiuchi cebalrai dog of the shepherdref and ophiuchi or marfik the elbow rs ophiuchi is part of a class called recurrent novae whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days it is thought to be at the brink of becoming a type-1a supernova barnards star one of the nearest stars to the solar system the only stars closer are the alpha centauri binary star system and proxima centauri lies in ophiuchus it is located to the left of and just north of the v-shaped group of stars in an area that was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation of taurus poniatovii poniatowskis bull in 2005 astronomers using data from the green bank telescope discovered a superbubble so large that it extends beyond the plane of the galaxy it is called the ophiuchus superbubble in april 2007 astronomers announced that the swedish-built odin satellite had made the first detection of clouds of molecular oxygen in space following observations in the constellation ophiuchus the supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 october 1604 near ophiuchi johannes kepler saw it first on 16 october and studied it so extensively that the supernova was subsequently called keplers supernova he published his findings in a book titled de stella nova in pede serpentarii on the new star in ophiuchus foot galileo used its brief appearance to counter the aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changeless in 2009 it was announced that gj 1214 a star in ophiuchus undergoes repeated cyclical dimming with a period of about 15 days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet the planets low density about 40 that of earth suggests that the planet may have a substantial component of low-density gaspossibly hydrogen or steam the proximity of this star to earth 42 light years makes it a tempting target for further observations in april 2010 the naked-eye star ophiuchi was occulted by the asteroid 824 anastasia deep-sky objects ophiuchus contains several star clusters such as ic 4665 ngc 6633 m9 m10 m12 m14 m19 m62 and m107 as well as the nebula ic 4603-4604 m10 is a fairly close globular cluster only 20000 light-years from earth it has a magnitude of 66 and is a shapley class vii cluster this means that it has intermediate concentration it is only somewhat concentrated towards its center the unusual galaxy merger remnant and starburst galaxy ngc 6240 is also in ophiuchus at a distance of 400 million light-years this butterfly-shaped galaxy has two supermassive black holes 3000 light-years apart confirmation of the fact that both nuclei contain black holes was obtained by spectra from the chandra x-ray observatory astronomers estimate that the black holes will merge in another billion years ngc 6240 also has an unusually high rate of star formation classifying it as a starburst galaxy this is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes and the aftermath of the collision in 2006 a new nearby star cluster was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star mu ophiuchi the mamajek 2 cluster appears to be a poor cluster remnant analogous to the ursa major moving group but 7 times more distant approximately 170 parsecs away mamajek 2 appears to have formed in the same star-forming complex as the ngc 2516 cluster roughly 135 million years ago barnard 68 is a large dark nebula located 410 light-years from earth despite its diameter of 04 light-years barnard 68 only has twice the mass of the sun making it both very diffuse and very cold with a temperature of about 16 kelvins though it is currently stable barnard 68 will eventually collapse inciting the process of star formation one unusual feature of barnard 68 is its vibrations which have a period of 250000 years astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the shock wave from a supernova voyager 1 is in the same direction of space as the constellation history and mythology there is no evidence of the constellation preceding the classical era and in babylonian astronomy a sitting gods constellation seems to have been located in the general area of ophiuchus however gavin white proposes that ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this babylonian constellation representing nirah a serpent-god who was sometimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs the earliest mention of the constellation is in aratus informed by the lost catalogue of eudoxus of cnidus 4th century bc to the phantoms back the crown is near but by his head mark near at hand the head of ophiuchus and then from it you can trace the starlit ophiuchus himself so brightly set beneath his head appear his gleaming shoulders they would be clear to mark even at the midmonth moon but his hands are not at all so bright for faint runs the gleam of stars along on this side and on that yet they too can be seen for they are not feeble both firmly clutch the serpent which encircles the waist of ophiuchus but he steadfast with both his feet well set tramples a huge monster even the scorpion standing upright on his eye and breast now the serpent is wreathed about his two hands a little above his right hand but in many folds high above his left to the ancient greeks the constellation represented the god apollo struggling with a huge snake that guarded the oracle of delphi later myths identified ophiuchus with laocon the trojan priest of poseidon who warned his fellow trojans about the trojan horse and was later slain by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods to punish him according to roman era mythography the figure represents the healer asclepius who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs to prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under asclepius care jupiter killed him with a bolt of lightning but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works in medieval islamic astronomy azophis uranometry 10th century the constellation was known as al-awwa the snake-charmer aratus describes ophiuchus as trampling on scorpius with his feet this is depicted in renaissance to early modern star charts beginning with albrecht drer in 1515 in some depictions such as that of johannes kepler in de stella nova 1606 scorpius also seems to threaten to sting serpentarius in the foot this is consistent with azophi who already included oph and oph as the snake-charmers left foot and oph and oph as his right foot making ophiuchus a zodiacal constellation at least as regards his feet this arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature and placed in relation to the words spoken by god to the serpent in the garden of eden genesis 315 zodiac ophiuchus is one of thirteen constellations that cross the ecliptic it has therefore been called the 13th sign of the zodiac however this confuses sign with constellation the signs of the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic so that each sign spans 30 of celestial longitude approximately the distance the sun travels in a month and in the western tradition are aligned with the seasons so that the march equinox always falls on the boundary between pisces and aries constellations on the other hand are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars the constellations of the zodiac have only a loose association with the signs of the zodiac and do not in general coincide with them in western astrology the constellation of aquarius for example largely corresponds to the sign of pisces similarly the constellation of ophiuchus occupies most november 29 december 18 of the sign of sagittarius november 23 december 21 the differences are due to the fact that the time of year that the sun passes through a particular zodiac constellations position has slowly changed because of the precession of the equinoxes over the centuries from when the greeks babylonians and the dacians through zamolxis originally developed
