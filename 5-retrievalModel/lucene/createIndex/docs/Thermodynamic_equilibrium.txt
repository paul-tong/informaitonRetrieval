thermodynamic equilibrium is an axiomatic concept of thermodynamics it is an internal state of a single thermodynamic system or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable walls in thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy either within a system or between systems in a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium no macroscopic change occurs systems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual thermal mechanical chemical and radiative equilibria systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium though not in others in thermodynamic equilibrium all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely until disturbed by a thermodynamic operation in a macroscopic equilibrium almost or perfectly exactly balanced microscopic exchanges occur this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium a thermodynamic system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform temperature its intensive properties other than temperature may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long range force field imposed on it by its surroundings in non-equilibrium systems by contrast there are net flows of matter or energy if such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring it is said to be in a metastable equilibrium though it is not a widely named law it is an axiom of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium the second law of thermodynamics states that when a body of material starts from an equilibrium state in which portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable and it is isolated then it spontaneously reaches its own new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the entropies of the portions overview classical thermodynamics deals with states of dynamic equilibrium the state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the one for which some thermodynamic potential is minimized or for which the entropy s is maximized for specified conditions one such potential is the helmholtz free energy a for a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and volume another potential the gibbs free energy g is minimized at thermodynamic equilibrium in a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and pressure where t denotes the absolute thermodynamic temperature p the pressure s the entropy v the volume and u the internal energy of the system thermodynamic equilibrium is the unique stable stationary state that is approached or eventually reached as the system interacts with its surroundings over a long time the above-mentioned potentials are mathematically constructed to be the thermodynamic quantities that are minimized under the particular conditions in the specified surroundings conditions for a completely isolated system s is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium for a system with controlled constant temperature and volume a is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium for a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure g is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium the various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows two systems are in thermal equilibrium when their temperatures are the same two systems are in mechanical equilibrium when their pressures are the same two systems are in diffusive equilibrium when their chemical potentials are the same all forces are balanced and there is no significant external driving force relation of exchange equilibrium between systems often the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regarded as another thermodynamic system in this view one may consider the system and its surroundings as two systems in mutual contact with long-range forces also linking them the enclosure of the system is the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two systems in the thermodynamic formalism that surface is regarded as having specific properties of permeability for example the surface of contiguity may be supposed to be permeable only to heat allowing energy to transfer only as heat then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium when the long-range forces are unchanging in time and the transfer of energy as heat between them has slowed and eventually stopped permanently this is an example of a contact equilibrium other kinds of contact equilibrium are defined by other kinds of specific permeability when two systems are in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability they have common values of the intensive variable that belongs to that particular kind of permeability examples of such intensive variables are temperature pressure chemical potential a contact equilibrium may be regarded also as an exchange equilibrium there is a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two systems in contact equilibrium for example for a wall permeable only to heat the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite an adiabatic wall between the two systems is permeable only to energy transferred as work at mechanical equilibrium the rates of transfer of energy as work between them are equal and opposite if the wall is a simple wall then the rates of transfer of volume across it are also equal and opposite and the pressures on either side of it are equal if the adiabatic wall is more complicated with a sort of leverage having an area-ratio then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio this keeps the zero balance of rates of transfer as work a radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate systems radiative exchange equilibrium prevails when the two systems have the same temperature thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium of a system a collection of matter may be entirely isolated from its surroundings if it has been left undisturbed for an indefinitely long time classical thermodynamics postulates that it is in a state in which no changes occur within it and there are no flows within it this is a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium this postulate is sometimes but not often called the minus first law of thermodynamics one textbook calls it the zeroth law remarking that the authors think this more befitting that title than its more customary definition which apparently was suggested by fowler such states are a principal concern in what is known as classical or equilibrium thermodynamics for they are the only states of the system that are regarded as well defined in that subject a system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a thermodynamic operation be isolated and upon the event of isolation no change occurs in it a system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regarded as being in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium multiple contact equilibrium the thermodynamic formalism allows that a system may have contact with several other systems at once which may or may not also have mutual contact the contacts having respectively different permeabilities if these systems are all jointly isolated from the rest of the world those of them that are in contact then reach respective contact equilibria with one another if several systems are free of adiabatic walls between each other but are jointly isolated from the rest of the world then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium and they have a common temperature a total internal energy and a total entropy amongst intensive variables this is a unique property of temperature it holds even in the presence of long-range forces that is there is no force that can maintain temperature discrepancies for example in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field the pressure on the top wall is less than that on the bottom wall but the temperature is the same everywhere a thermodynamic operation may occur as an event restricted to the walls that are within the surroundings directly affecting neither the walls of contact of the system of interest with its surroundings nor its interior and occurring within a definitely limited time for example an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium then according to the second law of thermodynamics the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings following planck this consequent train of events is called a natural thermodynamic process it is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium even though during the process there is transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium a natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course it is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static process that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course and is fictively reversible classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium if the main part of its course is at a finite rate then it is considered to be natural and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics and thereby irreversible engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings the allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of inanimate agency a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate otherwise a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system it is often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystems are so much larger than the system that the process can affect the intensive variables only of the surrounding subsystems and they are then called reservoirs for relevant intensive variables local and global equilibrium it is useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium in thermodynamics exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by intensive parameters as an example temperature controls heat exchanges global thermodynamic equilibrium gte means that those intensive parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system while local thermodynamic equilibrium lte means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time but are varying so slowly that for any point one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point if the description of the system requires variations in the intensive parameters that are too large the very assumptions upon which the definitions of these intensive parameters are based will break down and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium for example it takes a certain number of collisions for a particle to equilibrate to its surroundings if the average distance it has moved during these collisions removes it from the neighborhood it is equilibrating to it will never equilibrate and there will be no lte temperature is by definition proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrated neighborhood since there is no equilibrated neighborhood the concept of temperature doesnt hold and the temperature becomes undefined it is important to note that this local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particles in the system for example lte is usually applied only to massive particles in a radiating gas the photons being emitted and absorbed by the gas doesnt need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particles of the gas in order for lte to exist in some cases it is not considered necessary for free electrons to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atoms or molecules for lte to exist as an example lte will exist in a glass of water that contains a melting ice cube the temperature inside the glass can be defined at any point but it is colder near the ice cube than far away from it if energies of the molecules located near a given point are observed they will be distributed according to the maxwellboltzmann distribution for a certain temperature if the energies of the molecules located near another point are observed they will be distributed according to the maxwellboltzmann distribution for another temperature local thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity in other words each small locality need not have a constant temperature however it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local maxwellboltzmann distribution of molecular velocities a global non-equilibrium state can be stably stationary only if it is maintained by exchanges between the system and the outside for example a globally-stable stationary state could be maintained inside the glass of water by continuously adding finely powdered ice into it in order to compensate for the melting and continuously draining off the meltwater natural transport phenomena may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium going back to our example the diffusion of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium a state in which the temperature of the glass is completely homogeneous reservations careful and well informed writers about thermodynamics in their accounts of thermodynamic equilibrium often enough make provisos or reservations to their statements some writers leave such reservations merely implied or more or less unstated for example one widely cited writer h b callen writes in this context in actuality few systems are in absolute and true equilibrium he refers to radioactive processes and remarks that they may take cosmic times to complete and generally can be ignored he adds in practice the criterion for equilibrium is circular operationally a system is in an equilibrium state if its properties are consistently described by thermodynamic theory ja beattie and i oppenheim write insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all states of real systems another author cited by callen as giving a scholarly and rigorous treatment and cited by adkins as having written a classic text ab pippard writes in that text given long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense the time involved may be so enormous however perhaps 10 years or more for most purposes provided the rapid change is not artificially stimulated the systems may be regarded as being in equilibrium another author a mnster writes in this context he observes that thermonuclear processes often occur so slowly that they can be ignored in thermodynamics he comments the concept absolute equilibrium or equilibrium with respect to all imaginable processes has therefore no physical significance he therefore states that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions according to l tisza in the discussion of phenomena near absolute zero the absolute predictions of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of frozen-in nonequilibrium states is very common definitions the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system is through contact with the surroundings that allows simultaneous passages of all chemical substances and all kinds of energy a system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change its shape or size while doing so thus it is defined by a rigid volume in space it may lie within external fields of force determined by external factors of far greater extent than the system itself so that events within the system cannot in an appreciable amount affect the external fields of force the system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force fields are uniform and are determining its uniform acceleration or if it lies in a non-uniform force field but is held stationary there by local forces such as mechanical pressures on its surface thermodynamic equilibrium is a primitive notion of the theory of thermodynamics according to pm morse it should be emphasized that the fact that there are thermodynamic states and the fact that there are thermodynamic variables which are uniquely specified by the equilibrium state are not conclusions deduced logically from some philosophical first principles they are conclusions ineluctably drawn from more than two centuries of experiments this means that thermodynamic equilibrium is not to be defined solely in terms of other theoretical concepts of thermodynamics m bailyn proposes a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulates the existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium textbook definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium are often stated carefully with some reservation or other for example a mnster writes an isolated system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when in the system no changes of state are occurring at a measurable rate there are two reservations stated here the system is isolated any changes of state are immeasurably slow he discusses the second proviso by giving an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst mnster points out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state is described by fewer macroscopic variables than is any other state of a given system this is partly but not entirely because all flows within and through the system are zero r haases presentation of thermodynamics does not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intends to allow for non-equilibrium thermodynamics he considers an arbitrary system with time invariant properties he tests it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cutting it off from all external influences except external force fields if after insulation nothing changes he says that the system was in equilibrium in a section headed thermodynamic equilibrium hb callen defines equilibrium states in a paragraph he points out that they are determined by intrinsic factors within the system they are terminal states towards which the systems evolve over time which may occur with glacial slowness this statement does not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium the system must be isolated callen does not spell out what he means by the words intrinsic factors another textbook writer cj adkins explicitly allows thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which is not isolated his system is however closed with respect to transfer of matter he writes in general the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and work-like interactions with the surroundings he distinguishes such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium in which only thermal contact is mediating transfer of energy another textbook author jr partington writes i an equilibrium state is one which is independent of time but referring to systems which are only apparently in equilibrium he adds such systems are in states of false equilibrium partingtons statement does not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system like mnster partington also refers to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen he adds a proviso that in a true equilibrium state the smallest change of any external condition which influences the state will produce a small change of state this proviso means that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbations this requirement is essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium a student textbook by fh crawford has a section headed thermodynamic equilibrium it distinguishes several drivers of flows and then says these are examples of the apparently universal tendency of isolated systems toward a state of complete mechanical thermal chemical and electricalor in a single word thermodynamicequilibrium a monograph on classical thermodynamics by ha buchdahl considers the equilibrium of a thermodynamic system without actually writing the phrase thermodynamic equilibrium referring to systems closed to exchange of matter buchdahl writes if a system is in a terminal condition which is properly static it will be said to be in equilibrium buchdahls monograph also discusses amorphous glass for the purposes of thermodynamic description it states more precisely the glass may be regarded as being in equilibrium so long as experimental tests show that slow transitions are in effect reversible it is not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium but the converse is usually assumed that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is subject to a sufficiently slow process that process may be considered to be sufficiently nearly reversible and the body remains sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process a mnster carefully extends his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated systems by introducing a concept of contact equilibrium this specifies particular processes that are allowed when considering thermodynamic equilibrium for non-isolated systems with special concern for open systems which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings a contact equilibrium is between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings brought into contact with the system of interest the contact being through a special kind of wall for the rest the whole joint system is isolated walls of this special kind were also considered by c carathodory and are mentioned by other writers also they are selectively permeable they may be permeable only to mechanical work or only to heat or only to some particular chemical substance each contact equilibrium defines an intensive parameter for example a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature a contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest in a contact equilibrium despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall the system of interest is changeless as if it were in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium this scheme follows the general rule that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system means that with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall contact equilibrium exists when the respective intensive parameters of the system and surroundings are equal this definition does not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium which is through unselective contacts this definition does not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundaries but it is compatible with the following definition which does so state m zemansky also distinguishes mechanical chemical and thermal equilibrium he then writes when the conditions for all three types of equilibrium are satisfied the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium pm morse writes that thermodynamics is concerned with states of thermodynamic equilibrium he also uses the phrase thermal equilibrium while discussing transfer of energy as heat between a body and a heat reservoir in its surroundings though not explicitly defining a special term thermal equilibrium jr waldram writes of a definite thermodynamic state he defines the term thermal equilibrium for a system when its observables have ceased to change over time but shortly below that definition he writes of a piece of glass that has not yet reached its full thermodynamic equilibrium state considering equilibrium states m bailyn writes each intensive variable has its own type of equilibrium he then defines thermal equilibrium mechanical equilibrium and material equilibrium accordingly he writes if all the intensive variables become uniform thermodynamic equilibrium is said to exist he is not here considering the presence of an external force field jg kirkwood and i oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium as follows a system is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium if during the time period allotted for experimentation a its intensive properties are independent of time and b no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings it is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems they do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with glacial slowness and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation they note that for two systems in contact there exists a small subclass of intensive properties such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal then all respective intensive properties are equal states of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass provided some other conditions are satisfied characteristics of a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium homogeneity in the absence of external forces a thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase in the absence of external forces in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium is homogeneous this means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged in general a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some intensive variables for example a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation uniform temperature such equilibrium inhomogeneity induced by external forces does not occur for the intensive variable temperature according to ea guggenheim the most important conception of thermodynamics is temperature planck introduces his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium and then announces in the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous isotropic bodies of any form possessing throughout their substance the same temperature and density and subject to a uniform pressure acting everywhere perpendicular to the surface as did carathodory planck was setting aside surface effects and external fields and anisotropic crystals though referring to temperature planck did not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium in contrast carathodorys scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed systems postulates the concept of an equilibrium state following gibbs gibbs speaks routinely of a thermodynamic state though not explicitly using the phrase thermodynamic equilibrium nor explicitly postulating the existence of a temperature to define it the temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is uniform in space as well as in time in a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net internal macroscopic flows in particular this means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium this means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform this is so in all cases including those of non-uniform external force fields for an externally imposed gravitational field this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms by the calculus of variations using the method of langrangian multipliers considerations of kinetic theory or statistical mechanics also support this statement in order that a system may be in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium it is of course necessary but not sufficient that it be in its own internal state of thermal equilibrium it is possible for a system to reach internal mechanical equilibrium before it reaches internal thermal equilibrium number of real variables needed for specification in his exposition of his scheme of closed system equilibrium thermodynamics c carathodory initially postulates that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variables define the states that are the points of the manifold of equilibria in the words of prigogine and defay 1945 it is a matter of experience that when we have specified a certain number of macroscopic properties of a system then all the other properties are fixed as noted above according to a mnster the number of variables needed to define a thermodynamic equilibrium is the least for any state of a given isolated system as noted above jg kirkwood and i oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by a special subclass of intensive variables with a definite number of members in that subclass if the thermodynamic equilibrium lies in an external force field it is only the temperature that can in general be expected to be spatially uniform intensive variables other than temperature will in general be non-uniform if the external force field is non-zero in such a case in general additional variables are needed to describe the spatial non-uniformity stability against small perturbations as noted above jr partington points out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is stable against small transient perturbations without this condition in general experiments intended to study systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are in severe difficulties approach to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated system when a body of material starts from a non-equilibrium state of inhomogeneity or chemical non-equilibrium and is then isolated it spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium it is not necessary that all aspects of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reached simultaneously some can be established before others for example in many cases of such evolution internal mechanical equilibrium is established much more rapidly than the other aspects of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium another example is that in many cases of such evolution thermal equilibrium is reached much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium fluctuations within an isolated system in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time in classical physics it is often convenient to ignore the effects of measurement and this is assumed in the present account to consider the notion of fluctuations in an isolated thermodynamic system a convenient example is a system specified by its extensive state variables internal energy volume and mass composition by definition they are time-invariant by definition they combine with time-invariant nominal values of their conjugate intensive functions of state inverse temperature pressure divided by temperature and the chemical potentials divided by temperature so as to exactly obey the laws of thermodynamics but the laws of thermodynamics combined with the values of the specifying extensive variables of state are not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal values further information is needed namely of the constitutive properties of the system it may be admitted that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive functions of state they are found to have slightly different values from time to time such variability is regarded as due to internal fluctuations the different measured values average to their nominal values if the system is truly macroscopic as postulated by classical thermodynamics then the fluctuations are too small to detect macroscopically this is called the thermodynamic limit in effect the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanished from sight too small to see according to buchdahl there is no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuations about equilibrium see however section 76 if the system is repeatedly subdivided eventually a system is produced that is small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuations this is a mesoscopic level of investigation the fluctuations are then directly dependent on the natures of the various walls of the system the precise choice of independent state variables is then important at this stage statistical features of the laws of thermodynamics become apparent if the mesoscopic system is further repeatedly divided eventually a microscopic system is produced then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the processes of fluctuation one has left the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics and one needs quantum statistical mechanics the fluctuations can become relatively dominant and questions of measurement become important the statement that the system is its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium may be taken to mean that indefinitely many such measurements have been taken from time to time with no trend in time in the various measured values thus the statement that a system is in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium with stated nominal values of its functions of state conjugate to its specifying state variables is far far more informative than a statement that a set of single simultaneous measurements of those functions of state have those same values this is because the single measurements might have been made during a slight fluctuation away from another set of nominal values of those conjugate intensive functions of state that is due to unknown and different constitutive properties a single measurement cannot tell whether that might be so unless there is also knowledge of the nominal values that belong to the equilibrium state thermal equilibrium an explicit distinction between thermal equilibrium and thermodynamic equilibrium is made by b c eu he considers two systems in thermal contact one a thermometer the other a system in which there are occurring several irreversible processes entailing non-zero fluxes the two systems are separated by a wall permeable only to heat he considers the case in which over the time scale of interest it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined then it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism in other words thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process this illustrates the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature thermal equilibrium is achieved when two systems in thermal contact with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy it follows that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium then their temperatures are the same thermal equilibrium occurs when a systems macroscopic thermal observables have ceased to change with time for example an ideal gas whose distribution function has stabilised to a specific maxwellboltzmann distribution would be in thermal equilibrium this outcome allows a single temperature and pressure to be attributed to the whole system for an isolated body it is quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reached before thermal equilibrium is reached but eventually all aspects of equilibrium including thermal equilibrium are necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium non-equilibrium a systems internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguished from a stationary state in which thermodynamic parameters are unchanging in time but the system is not isolated so that there are into and out of the system non-zero macroscopic fluxes which are constant in time non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are changing or can be triggered to change over time and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems the thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods laws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are also debatable one of the guiding principles for these systems is the maximum entropy production principle it states that a non-equilibrium system evolves such as to maximize its entropy production see also
