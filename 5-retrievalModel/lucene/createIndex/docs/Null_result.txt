in science a null result is a result without the expected content that is the proposed result is absent it is an experimental outcome which does not show an otherwise expected effect this does not imply a result of zero or nothing simply a result that does not support the hypothesis the term is a translation of the scientific latin nullus resultarum meaning no consequence in statistical hypothesis testing a null result occurs when an experimental result is not significantly different from what is to be expected under the null hypothesis its probability under the null hypothesis does not exceed the significance level ie the threshold set prior to testing for rejection of the null hypothesis the significance level varies but is often set at p-value 005 5 as an example in physics the results of the michelsonmorley experiment were of this type as it did not detect the expected velocity relative to the postulated luminiferous aether this experiments famous failed detection commonly referred to as the null result contributed to the development of special relativity the experiment did appear to measure a non-zero drift but the value was far too small to account for the theoretically expected results it is generally thought to be inside the noise level of the experiment scientific journals for null results there are now several scientific journals dedicated to the publication of negative or null results including the following data - the journal for negative null and inconclusive results nni results all results journals chemistry nanotechnology biology physics european journal of negative results in biomedicine journal of articles in support of the null hypothesis psychology journal of negative results primarily ecology and evolutionary biology - no publication since 2013 journal of negative results in biomedicine journal of pharmaceutical negative results see also aether theories imponderable fluid publication bias
