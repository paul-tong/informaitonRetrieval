a compound word derived from the two greek words from aitho i burn ops face according to the perseus digital library the designation properly translates as burnt-face in noun form and red-brown in adjectival form the historian herodotus used the appellation to denote those parts of africa below the sahara that were then known within the ecumene inhabitable world however the greek formation may be a folk etymology for the ancient egyptian term athtiu-abu which means robbers of hearts this greek name was borrowed into amharic as tyy in greco-roman epigraphs aethiopia was a specific toponym for ancient nubia at least as early as c 850 the name aethiopia also occurs in many translations of the old testament in allusion to nubia the ancient hebrew texts identify nubia instead as kush however in the new testament the greek term aithiops does occur referring to a servant of candace or kandake possibly an inhabitant of mero in nubia following the hellenic and biblical traditions the monumentum adulitanum a third century inscription belonging to the aksumite empire indicates that aksums then ruler governed an area which was flanked to the west by the territory of ethiopia and sasu the aksumite king ezana would eventually conquer nubia the following century and the aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation ethiopians for their own kingdom in the geez version of the ezana inscription a is equated with the unvocalized btm and bt abashat and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of aksum this new demonym would subsequently be rendered as bs absh in sabaic and as abasha in arabic in the 15th-century geez book of aksum the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called ityoppis he was an extra-biblical son of cush son of ham said to have founded the city of axum in english and generally outside of ethiopia the country was once historically known as abyssinia this toponym was derived from the latinized form of the ancient habash history prehistory several important finds have propelled ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront ofpalaeontology the oldest hominid discovered to date in ethiopia is the 42 million year old ardipithicus ramidus ardi found by tim d white in 1994 the most well known hominid discovery is australopithecus afarensis lucy known locally as dinkinesh the specimen was found in the awash valley of ethiopias afar region in 1974 by donald johanson and is one of the most complete and best preserved adult australopithecine fossils ever uncovered lucys taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made the hominid is estimated to have lived 32 million years ago ethiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of anatomically modern humans homo sapiens the oldest of these local fossil finds the omo remains were excavated in the southwestern omo kibish area and have been dated to the middle paleolithic around 200000 years ago additionally skeletons of homo sapiens idaltu were found at a site in the middle awash valley dated to approximately 160000 years ago they may represent an extinct subspecies of homo sapiens or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans homo sapiens fossils excavated at the jebel irhoud site in morocco have since been dated to an earlier period about 300000 years ago according to linguists the first afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing neolithic era from the familys proposed urheimat original homeland in the nile valley or the near east other scholars propose that the afroasiatic family developed in situ in the horn with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there craniometric analysis of the herto homo sapiens idaltu skull found that the fossil was morphologically distinct from crania belonging to modern afroasiatic-speaking groups from the horn of africa and dynastic egypt the latter populations instead possessed middle eastern affinities this suggests that the afroasiatic-speaking groups settled in the area during a later epoch having possibly arrived from the middle east antiquity around the 8th century bc a kingdom known as dmt was established in tigray northern ethiopia and eritrea the politys capital was located at yeha in northern ethiopia most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native ethiopian one although sabaean-influenced because of the latters hegemony of the red sea other scholars regard dmt as the result of a union of afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the cushitic and semitic branches namely local agaw peoples and sabaeans from south arabia however geez the ancient semitic language of ethiopia is thought to have developed independently from sabaean one of the south semitic languages as early as 2000 bc other semitic speakers were living in ethiopia and eritrea where geez developed sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor limited to a few localities and disappearing after a few decades or a century it may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the ethiopian civilization of dmt or some other proto-aksumite state after the fall of dmt during the fourth century bc the ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms in the first century ad the kingdom of aksum emerged in what is now tigray and eritrea according to the medieval book of aksum the kingdoms first capital mazaber was built by itiyopis son of cush aksum would later at times extend its rule into yemen on the other side of the red sea the persian religious figure mani listed aksum with rome persia and china as one of the four great powers of his era during the 3rd century around 316 ad frumentius and his brother edesius from tyre accompanied their uncle on a voyage to ethiopia when the vessel stopped at a red sea port the natives killed all the travelers except the two brothers who were taken to the court as slaves they were given positions of trust by the monarch and they converted members of the royal court to christianity frumentius became the first bishop of aksum a coin dated to 324 shows that ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt christianity after armenia did so in 301 although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles it was the first major power to do so as the aksumite kingdom gradually declined one of the earliest local muslim states the makhzumi sultanate was established in the shewa region the polity was governed by the makhzumi dynasty which reigned over the province until it was deposed around 1280 by the walashma dynasty during muhammads era the first interaction that the islamic prophet muhammad had with ethiopia was during the reign of aama ibn abjar who was at the time the emperor of aksum and gave refuge to several muslims in the kingdom of aksum in 614 ad according to other authors ashama may have been the same person as king armah or his father or son taddesse tamrat records that the inhabitants of wiqro where the ruler is known as ashamat al-negashi claim that his tomb is located in their village muhammads second interaction with ethiopia was during the expedition of zaid ibn haritha when he sent amr bin umayyah al-damri to the king of ethiopia then abyssinia middle ages the zagwe dynasty ruled many parts of present-day ethiopia and eritrea between the early 12th and late 13th century the name of the dynasty is derived from the cushitic-speaking agaw of northern ethiopia from 1270 ad until the zemene mesafint age of princes the solomonic dynasty governed the ethiopian empire in the early 15th century ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with european kingdoms for the first time since the aksumite era a letter from henry iv of england to the emperor of abyssinia survives in 1428 yeshaq i sent two emissaries to alfonso v of aragon who sent return emissaries they failed to complete the return trip the first continuous relations with a european country began in 1508 with portugal under dawit ii lebna dengel who had just inherited the throne from his father this proved to be an important development for when the empire was subjected to the attacks of the adal sultanates general and imam ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazi called gra the left-handed portugal assisted the ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men who helped his son gelawdewos defeat ahmad and re-establish his rule this abyssinianadal war was also one of the first proxy wars in the region as the ottoman empire and portugal took sides in the conflict when emperor susenyos i converted to roman catholicism in 1624 years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths the jesuit missionaries had offended the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo faith of the local ethiopians in june 1632 fasilides susenyos son declared the state religion again to be the ethiopian orthodoxy he expelled the jesuit missionaries and other europeans aussa sultanate the sultanate of aussa or afar sultanate succeeded the earlier imamate of aussa the latter polity had come into existence in 1577 when muhammed jasa moved his capital from harar to aussa asaita with the split of the adal sultanate into the sultanate of aussa and the sultanate of harar at some point after 1672 the sultanate of aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with imam umar din bin adams recorded ascension to the throne the sultanate was subsequently re-established by kedafu around the year 1734 it was thereafter ruled by his mudaito dynasty the primary symbol of the sultan was a silver baton which was considered to have magical properties zemene mesafint between 1755 and 1855 ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the zemene mesafint or age of princes the emperors became figureheads controlled by warlords like ras mikael sehul of tigray ras wolde selassie of tigray and by the yejju oromo dynasty such as ras gugsa of yejju which later led to 17th-century oromo rule of gondar changing the language of the court from amharic to afaan oromo ethiopian isolationism ended following a british mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations but it was not until 1855 that ethiopia was completely united and the power in the emperor restored beginning with the reign of tewodros ii upon his ascent he began modernizing ethiopia and recentralizing power in the emperor ethiopia began to take part in world affairs once again but tewodros suffered several rebellions inside his empire northern oromo militias tigrayan rebellion and the constant incursion of ottoman empire and egyptian forces near the red sea brought the weakening and the final downfall of tewodros ii he killed himself in 1868 during his last battle with the british expedition to abyssinia emperor tewodros ii was born in begemder from a nobleman of qwara where the qwara dialect of agaw language is spoken after tewodros death tekle giyorgis ii was proclaimed emperor he was defeated in the battles of zulawu 21 june 1871 and adua 11 july 1871 kassai was subsequently declared yohannes iv on 21 january 1872 in 1875 and 1876 turkishegyptian forces accompanied by many european and american advisors twice invaded abyssinia but were initially defeated once at the battle of gundet losing 800 men and then in the second invasion decisively defeated by emperor yohannes iv at the battle of gura on 7 march 1875 where the invading forces lost at least 3000 men by death or captured from 1885 to 1889 ethiopia joined the mahdist war allied to britain turkey and egypt against the sudanese mahdist state on 10 march 1889 yohannes iv was killed by the sudanese khalifah abdullahs army whilst leading his army in the battle of gallabat also called battle of metemma from menelik ii to adwa 18891913 ethiopia in its roughly current form began under the reign of menelik ii who was emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913 from his base in the central province of shewa menelik set out to annex territories to the south east and west areas inhabited by the oromo sidama gurage welayta and other groups he did this with the help of ras gobana dacches shewan oromo militia which occupied lands that had not been held since ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazis war as well as other areas that had never been under ethiopian sovereignty meneliks campaign against oromos outside his army was largely in retaliation for centuries of oromo expansionism and the zemene mesafint a period during which a succession of oromo feudal rulers dominated the highlanders chief among these was the yejju dynasty which included aligaz of yejju and his brother ali i of yejju ali i founded the town of debre tabor in the amhara region which became the dynastys capital menelik was born from king hailemelekot of shewa and his mother ejegayehu lema adeyamo who was a servant in the royal household he had been born at angolala in an oromo area and had lived his first twelve years with shewan oromos with whom he thus had much in common during his reign menelik ii made advances in road construction electricity and education the development of a central taxation system and the foundation and building of the city of addis ababawhich became capital of shewa province in 1881 after he ascended to the throne in 1889 it was renamed as addis ababa the new capital of abyssinia menelik had signed the treaty of wichale with italy in may 1889 in which italy would recognize ethiopias sovereignty so long as italy could control an area north of ethiopia part of modern eritrea in return italy was to provide menelik with weapons and support him as emperor the italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the italian government to expand their territorial claims this conflict erupted in the battle of adwa on 1 march 1896 in which italys colonial forces were defeated by the ethiopians about a third of the population died in the great ethiopian famine 1888 to 1892 haile selassie i era 19161974 the early 20th century was marked by the reign of emperor haile selassie ras tafari haile selassie i was born to parents from three of ethiopias afroasiatic-speaking populations the oromo and amhara the countrys two largest ethnic groups as well as the gurage he came to power after iyasu v was deposed and undertook a nationwide modernization campaign from 1916 when he was made a ras and regent inderase for the empress regnant zewditu and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire following zewditus death on 2 november 1930 he succeeded her as emperor the independence of ethiopia was interrupted by the second italo-ethiopian war beginning when it was invaded by fascist italy in early october 1935 and italian occupation of the country 19361941 during this time haile selassie appealed to the league of nations in 1935 delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure and the 1935 time man of the year as the majority of the ethiopian population lived in rural towns italy faced continued resistance and ambushes in urban centers throughout its occupation haile selassie fled into exile in fairfield house bath and mussolini was able to proclaim italian ethiopia and the assumption of the imperial title by the italian king vittorio emanuele iii in 1937 the italian massacre of yekatit 12 in which many ethiopians were imprisoned and massacred took place this was because of a failed attempt to assassinate rodolfo graziani the viceroy of italian east africa following the entry of italy into world war ii british empire forces together with the arbegnoch lit patriots referring to armed resistance soldiers restored sovereignty of ethiopia in the course of the east african campaign in 1941 an italian guerrilla campaign continued until 1943 this was followed by british recognition of ethiopias full sovereignty ie without any special british privileges with the signing of the anglo-ethiopian agreement in december 1944 on 26 august 1942 haile selassie issued a proclamation that removed ethiopias legal basis for slavery ethiopia had between two and four million slaves in the early 20th century out of a total population of about eleven million in 1952 haile selassie orchestrated the federation with eritrea he dissolved this in 1962 and annexed eritrea resulting in war of independence haile selassie played a leading role in the formation of the organisation of african unity oau in 1963 opinion within ethiopia turned against haile selassie i owing to the worldwide oil crisis of 1973 this oil crisis caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 february 1974 food shortages uncertainty regarding the succession border wars and discontent in the middle class created through modernization the high gasoline prices motivated the taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 february 1974 and students and workers in addis ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 february 1974 the feudal oligarchial cabinet of akilou habte wolde was toppled and a new government was formed with endelkachew makonnen serving as prime minister communist era

movements in 1989 to form the coalition known as the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf concurrently the soviet union began to retreat from building world communism under mikhail gorbachevs glasnost and perestroika policies marking a dramatic reduction in aid to ethiopia from socialist bloc countries this resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north the collapse of marxismleninism in general and in eastern europe during the revolutions of 1989 coincided with the soviet union stopping aid to ethiopia altogether in 1990 the strategic outlook for mengistu quickly deteriorated eprdf forces advanced on addis ababa in may 1991 and the soviet union did not intervene to save the

republic wherein the prime minister is the head of government the president is the head of state left with only ceremonial powers executive power is exercised by the government federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament on the basis of article 78 of the 1994 ethiopian constitution the judiciary is completely independent of the executive and the legislature the current realities of this provision are questioned in a report prepared by freedom house according to the democracy index published by the united kingdom-based economist intelligence unit in late 2010 ethiopia is an authoritarian regime ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries ethiopia has dropped 12 places on the list since 2006 and the latest report attributes the drop to the governments crackdown on opposition activities media and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election which the report argues has made ethiopia a de facto one-party state in july 2015 during a trip that then us president barack obama took to ethiopia he highlighted the role of the country in the fight against islamic terrorism obama was the first sitting united states president to visit ethiopia governance the election of ethiopias 547-member constituent assembly was held in june 1994 this assembly adopted the constitution of the federal democratic republic of

able to participate had they chosen to do so the current government of ethiopia was installed in august 1995 the first president was negasso gidada the eprdf-led government of prime minister meles zenawi promoted a policy of ethnic federalism devolving significant powers to regional ethnically based authorities ethiopia today has nine semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues under the present government some fundamental freedoms including freedom of the press are circumscribed citizens have little access to media other than the state-owned networks and most private newspapers struggle to remain open and suffer periodic harassment from the government since the 2005 elections at least 18 journalists who had written articles critical of the government were arrested on genocide and treason charges the government uses press laws governing libel to intimidate journalists who are critical of its policies meles government was elected in 2000 in ethiopias first-ever multiparty elections however the results were heavily criticized by international observers and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent the eprdf also won the 2005 election returning meles to power although the opposition vote increased in the election both the opposition and observers from the european union and elsewhere stated that the vote did not meet international standards for fair and free elections ethiopian police are said to have massacred 193 protesters mostly in the capital addis ababa in the violence following the may 2005 elections in the

forcing the relocation of hundreds of thousands of indigenous people from their lands in the gambela region the report describes the ethiopian governments plans to move over 15 million people by the end of 2013 in order to allow foreign investors to develop the land for large scale industrial agriculture according to several reports by the organization those who refused were the subject of a variety of intimidation techniques including physical and sexual abuse which sometimes led to deaths a similar 2012 report by human rights watch also describes the ethiopian governments 20102011 villagization program in gambella with plans to carry out similar resettlements in other regions the ethiopian government has denied the accusations of land grabbing and instead pointed to the positive trajectory of the countries economy as evidence of the development programs benefits military administrative divisions before 1996 ethiopia was divided into thirteen provinces many derived from historical regions the nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a federal government overseeing ethnically based regional states zones districts woreda and kebeles neighbourhoods since 1996 ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous regional states kililoch singular kilil and two chartered cities astedader akababiwoch singular astedader akababi the latter being addis ababa and dire dawa the kililoch are subdivided into sixty-eight zones and then further into 550 woredas and several special woredas the constitution assigns extensive power to regional states which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal governments constitution each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions article 39 of the ethiopian constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from ethiopia there is debate however as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states the councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus such elaborate structure of council executive and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level woreda geography at 1126829 square kilometres 435071sqmi ethiopia is the worlds 27th-largest country comparable in size to bolivia it lies between the 3rd parallel north and the 15th parallel north and longitudes 33rd meridian east and 48th meridian east the major portion of ethiopia lies on the horn of africa which is the easternmost part of the african landmass bordering ethiopia are sudan and south sudan to the west djibouti and eritrea to the north somalia to the east and kenya to the south within ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the great rift valley which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands steppes or semi-desert the great diversity of terrain determines wide variations in climate soils natural vegetation and settlement patterns ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts lake tana in the north is the source of the blue nile it also has a large number of endemic species notably the gelada the walia ibex and the ethiopian wolf simien fox the wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation climate the predominant climate type is tropical monsoon with wide topographic-induced variation the ethiopian highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the equator most of the countrys major cities are located at elevations of around 20002500m 65628202ft above sea level including historic capitals such as gondar and axum the modern capital addis ababa is situated on the foothills of mount entoto at an elevation of around 2400 metres 7900ft it experiences a mild climate year round with temperatures fairly uniform year round the seasons in addis ababa are largely defined by rainfall a dry season from october to february a light rainy season from march to may and a heavy rainy season from june to september the average annual rainfall is approximately 1200 millimetres 47in there are on average 7 hours of sunshine per day the dry season is the sunniest time of the year though even at the height of the rainy season in july and august there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine the average annual temperature in addis ababa is 16c 608f with daily maximum temperatures averaging 2025c 680770f throughout the year and overnight lows averaging 510c 410500f most major cities and tourist sites in ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to addis ababa and have a comparable climate in less elevated regions particularly the lower lying ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of the country the climate can be significantly hotter and drier dallol in the danakil depression in this eastern zone has the worlds highest average annual temperature of 34c 932f environment wildlife ethiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals the african wild dog prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory however with last sightings at finichaa this canid is thought to be potentially locally extinct the ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within ethiopia ethiopia is a global center of avian diversity to date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in ethiopia twenty of which are endemic to the country sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered a large number of these birds feed on butterflies like the bicyclus anynana historically throughout the african continent wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging civil wars pollution poaching and other human factors a 17-year-long civil war along with severe drought negatively impacted ethiopias environmental conditions leading to even greater habitat degradation habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment when changes to a habitat occur rapidly animals do not have time to adjust human impact threatens many species with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases with carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6494000 tonnes ethiopia contributes just 002 to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases ethiopia has a large number of species listed as critically endangered endangered and vulnerable to global extinction the threatened species in ethiopia can be broken down into three categories based on iucn ratings critically endangered endangered and vulnerable deforestation ethiopia is one of the eight fundamental and independent centers of origin for cultivated plants in the world however deforestation is a major concern for ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion loss of nutrients in the soil loss of animal habitats and reduction in biodiversity at the beginning of the 20th century around 420000km or 35 of ethiopias land was covered by trees but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 119 of the area ethiopia loses an estimated 1410km of natural forests each year between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21000km of forests current government programs to control deforestation consist of education promoting reforestation programs and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber in rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat organizations such as sos and farm africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management working with a grant of approximately 23 million euros the ethiopian government recently began training people on reducing erosion and using proper irrigation techniques that do not contribute to deforestation this project is assisting more than 80 communities economy according to the imf ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world registering over 10 economic growth from 2004 through 2009 it was the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent african economy in the years 2007 and 2008 in 2015 the world bank highlighted that ethiopia had witnessed rapid economic growth with real domestic product gdp growth averaging 109 between 2004 and 2014 in 2008 and 2011 ethiopias growth performance and considerable development gains were challenged by high inflation and a difficult balance of payments situation inflation surged to 40 in august 2011 because of loose monetary policy large civil service wage increase in early 2011 and high food prices for 201112 end-year inflation was projected to be about 22 and single digit inflation is projected in 201213 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies in spite of fast growth in recent years gdp per capita is one of the lowest in the world and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems however with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks ethiopias economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in africa the ethiopian constitution defines the right to own land as belonging only to the state and the people but citizens may lease land up to 99 years and are unable to mortgage or sell renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues as there is no land ownership infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users which then end up being displaced and without home or land a lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests in addition agricultural productivity remains low and frequent droughts still beset the country also leading to internal displacement energy and hydropower ethiopia has 14 major rivers which flow from its highlands including the nile the country has the largest water reserves in africa as of 2012 hydroelectric plants represented around 882 of the total installed electricity capacity the remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels 83 and other renewable sources 36 the electrification rate for the total population in 2013 was 24 with 85 coverage in urban areas and 10 coverage in rural areas as of 2014 total electricity production was 95 billion kwh and consumption was 67 billion kwh there were 11 billion kwh in electricity exports 0 kwh in electricity imports and 24 million kw of installed generating capacity ethiopia delivers roughly 81 of water volume to the nile through the river basins of the blue nile sobat river and atbara in 1959 egypt and sudan signed a bilateral treaty the 1959 nile waters agreement which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the nile waters ever since egypt was under international law they voted that almost all projects in ethiopia that sought to utilize the local nile tributaries this had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western ethiopia thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects however ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6450 mw hydroelectric dam on the blue nile river when completed this grand ethiopian renaissance dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station on the continent the gibe iii hydroelectric project already generates an estimated 1870-mw agriculture agriculture constitutes around 85 of the labour force however the service sector represents the largest portion of the gdp many other economic activities depend on agriculture including marketing processing and export of agricultural products production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector principal crops include coffee legumes oilseeds cereals potatoes sugarcane and vegetables ethiopia is also a vavilov center of diversity for domesticated crops including enset coffee and teff exports are almost entirely agricultural commodities with the exception of gold exports and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner ethiopia is africas second biggest maize producer according to un estimations the per capita gdp of ethiopia has reached 357 as of 2011 the same report indicated that the life expectancy had improved substantially in recent years the life expectancy of men is reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years exports exports from ethiopia in the 20092010 financial year totaled us14 billion the country produces more coffee than any other nation on the continentcoffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million ethiopians 16 of the populationfarmers in the eastern part of the country where a warming climate is already impacting production have struggled in recent years and many are currently reporting largely failed harvests as a result of a prolonged drought ethiopia also has the 5th largest inventory of cattle other main export commodities are khat gold leather products and oilseeds recent development of the floriculture sector means ethiopia is poised to become one of the top flower and plant exporters in the world cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation in east africa over 95 of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels the unofficial trade of live cattle camels sheep and goats from ethiopia sold to somalia djibouti and kenya generates an estimated total value of between 250 and us300 million annually 100 times more than the official figure this trade helps lower food prices increase food security relieve border tensions and promote regional integration however the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders furthermore the government of ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade with the private sector growing slowly designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business with taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country additional small-scale export products include cereals pulses cotton sugarcane potatoes and hides with the construction of various new dams and growing hydroelectric power projects around the country ethiopia also plans to export electric power to its neighbors most regard ethiopias large water resources and potential as its white oil and its coffee resources as black gold the country also has large mineral resources and oil potential in some of the less inhabited regions political instability in those regions however has inhibited development ethiopian geologists were implicated in a major gold swindle in 2008 four chemists and geologists from the ethiopian geological survey were arrested in connection with a fake gold scandal following complaints from buyers in south africa gold bars from the national bank of ethiopia were found by police to be gilded metal costing the state around us17 million according to the science and development network website in 2011 the grand ethiopian renaissance dam project was commenced when completed it will provide surplus energy in ethiopia which will be available for export to neighboring countries transportation ethiopia has 926km of electrified 1435mm 4ft82in standard gauge railways 656km for the addis ababadjibouti railway between addis ababa and the port of djibouti via awash and 270km for the awashhara gebeya railway between addis ababa and the twin cities of dessiekombolcha also via awash both railways are either in trial service or still under construction as of august2017 once commissioned and fully operational in 20182019 both railways will allow passenger transport with a designated speed of 120kmhour and freight transport with a speed of 80kmhour expected travel time from addis ababa to djibouti city for passengers would be less than twelve hours and travel time from addis ababa to dessiekombolcha would be around six hours beyond the first 270km of the awashhara gebeya railway a second construction phase over 120km foresees the extension of this railway from dessiekombolcha to hara gebeyawoldiya it is not clear when this section will be built and opened a third northern 216km long railway is also under construction between mekele and woldiya but it is also not clear when this railway will be commissioned and opened all railways are part of a future railway network of more than 5000km of railways the national railway network of ethiopia as the first part of a ten-year road sector development program between 1997 and 2002 the ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads as a result as of 2015 ethiopia has a total federal and regional of 100000km of roads both paved and gravel ethiopia had 58 airports as of 2012 and 61 as of 2016 among these the bole international airport in addis ababa and the aba tenna dejazmach yilma international airport in dire dawa accommodate international flights ethiopian airlines is the countrys flag carrier and is wholly owned by the government of ethiopia from its hub at the bole international airport the airline serves a network of 102 international passenger 20 domestic passenger and 44 cargo destinations it is also one of the fastest-growing carriers in the industry and continent demographics ethiopias population has grown from 335 million in 1983 to 879 million in 2014 the population was only about 9 million in the 19th century the 2007 population and housing census results show that the population of ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 26 between 1994 and 2007 down from 28 during the period 19831994 currently the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world the population is forecast to grow to over 210 million by 2060 which would be an increase from 2011 estimates by a factor of about 25 the countrys population is highly diverse containing over 80 different ethnic groups according to the ethiopian national census of 2007 the oromo are the largest ethnic group in ethiopia at 344 of the nations population the amhara represent 270 of the countrys inhabitants while somalis and tigrayans represent 62 and 61 of the population respectively other prominent ethnic groups are as follows sidama 40 gurage 25 welayta 23 afar 17 hadiya 17 gamo 15 and others 126 afroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population among these semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the habesha people the arabic form of this term al-abasha is the etymological basis of abyssinia the former name of ethiopia in english and other european languages additionally nilo-saharan-speaking ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country particularly in areas of the gambela region which borders south sudan the largest ethnic groups among these include the nuer and anuak in addition ethiopia had over 75000 italian settlers during the italian occupation of the country after independence many italians remained for decades after receiving full pardon by emperor selassie as he saw the opportunity to continue the modernization efforts of the country however due to the ethiopian civil war in 1974 nearly 22000 italo-ethiopians left the country in the 2000s some italian companies returned to operate in ethiopia and a large number of italian technicians and managers arrived with their families residing mainly in the metropolitan area of the capital in 2009 ethiopia hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 135200 the majority of this population came from somalia approximately 64300 persons eritrea 41700 and sudan 25900 the ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps languages languages of ethiopia as of 2007 census according to ethnologue there are 90 individual languages spoken in ethiopia most people in the country speak afroasiatic languages of the cushitic or semitic branches the former includes oromiffa spoken by the oromo and somali spoken by the somalis the latter includes amharic spoken by the amhara and tigrinya spoken by the tigrayans together these four groups make up about three-quarters of ethiopias population other afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the cushitic sidamo afar hadiyya and agaw languages as well as the semitic gurage languages harari silte and argobba languages arabic which also belongs to the afroasiatic family is likewise spoken in some areas additionally omotic languages are spoken by omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions among these idioms are aari bench dime dizin gamo-gofa-dawro maale hamer and wolaytta languages from the nilo-saharan family are also spoken by ethnic minorities concentrated in the southwestern parts of the country these languages include nuer anuak nyangatom majang suri meen and mursi english is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools amharic was the language of primary school instruction but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as oromiffa somali or tigrinya while all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 constitution of ethiopia amharic is recognized as the official working language of the federal government the various regions of ethiopia and chartered cities are free to determine their own working languages amharic is recognised as the official working language of amhara region benishangul-gumuz southern nations nationalities and peoples region gambela region addis abeba and dire dawa while afar harari oromiffa somali and tigrinya are recognized as official working languages in their respective regions italian the former colonial language is still spoken by few parts of the population mostly among older generations and is taught in many schools most notably the istituto statale italiano omnicomprensivo di addis abeba also amharic and tigrinya has many words borrowed from the italian language script in terms of writing systems ethiopias principal orthography is the geez script employed as an abugida for several of the countrys languages it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries bc as an abjad to transcribe the semitic geez language geez now serves as the liturgical language of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church and eritrean orthodox tewahedo church during the 1980s the ethiopic character set was computerized it is today part of the unicode standard as ethiopic ethiopic extended ethiopic supplement and ethiopic extended-a other writing systems have also been used over the years by different ethiopian communities the latter include bakri sapalos script for oromiffa religion religion in ethiopia 2007 ethiopia has close historical ties with all three of the worlds major abrahamic religions in the 4th century the ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt christianity as the state religion as a result of the resolutions of the council of chalcedon in 451 the miaphysites which included the vast majority of christians in egypt and ethiopia were accused of monophysitism and designated as heretics under the common name of coptic christianity see oriental orthodoxy while no longer distinguished as a state religion the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church remains the majority christian denomination there is also a substantial muslim demographic representing around a third of the population additionally ethiopia is the site of the first hegira a major emigration in islamic history a town in the tigray region negash is the oldest muslim settlement in africa until the 1980s a substantial population of beta israel ethiopian jews resided in ethiopia according to the 2007 national census christians make up 628 of the countrys population 435 ethiopian orthodox 193 other denominations muslims 339 practitioners of traditional faiths 26 and other religions 06 this is in agreement with the cia world factbook which states that christianity is the most widely practiced religion in ethiopia the ratio of the christian to muslim population has largely remained stable when compared to previous censuses conducted decades ago sunnis form the majority of muslims with non-denominational muslims being the second largest group of muslims and the shia and ahmadiyyas are a minority sunnis are largely shafiis or salafis and there are also many sufi muslims there the large muslim population in the northern afar region has resulted in a muslim separatist movement called the islamic state of afaria seeking a sharia-compliant constitution the kingdom of aksum was one of the first polities to officially embrace christianity when frumentius of tyre called fremnatos or abba selama father of peace in ethiopia converted emperor ezana during the fourth century according to the new testament christianity had entered ethiopia even earlier when an official in the ethiopian royal treasury was baptized by philip the evangelist the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church is part of oriental orthodoxy it is by far the largest christian denomination although a number of pentay protestant churches have recently gained ground since 1930 a relatively small ethiopian catholic church has existed in full communion with rome with adherents making up less than 1 of the total population islam in ethiopia dates back to the founding of the religion in 622 when a group of muslims were counseled by muhammad to escape persecution in mecca the disciples subsequently migrated to abyssinia via modern-day eritrea which was at the time ruled by ashama ibn-abjar a pious christian emperor also the largest single ethnic group of non-arab sahabah was that of the ethiopians according to the 2007 population and housing census around 1957944 people in ethiopia are adherents of traditional religions an additional 471861 residents practice other creeds while followers of all religions can be found in each region they tend to be concentrated in certain parts of the country christians predominantly live in the northern amhara and tigray regions and are largely members of the non-chalcedonian ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church those belonging to pentay are centered in the southern nations nationalities and peoples region snnp and oromia muslims in ethiopia predominantly adhere to sunni islam and generally inhabit eastern and northeastern areas particularly the somali afar dire dawa and harari regions practitioners of traditional religions mainly reside in the nations far southwestern and western rural borderlands in the snnp benishangul-gumuz and gambela regions human rights groups have regularly accused the government of arresting activists journalists and bloggers to stamp out dissent among some religious communities lengthy prison terms were handed to 17 muslim activists on 3 august 2015 ranging from seven to 22 years they were charged with trying to create an islamic state in the majority christian country all the defendants denied the charges and claimed that they were merely protesting in defence of their rights beta israel there is a small yet significant number of jews in ethiopia who claim to be one of the lost tribes of israel in the 1980s the number of ethiopian-jews decreased as many started moving to israel the tribe has been given the name beta israel there are a higher number of ethiopian-jews living in israel today though in certain ethiopian towns and villages such as wolleka near the ethiopian city of gondar the concentration of ethiopian-jews reaches an estimated 100 the us also has a significant number of ethiopian-jews with a population slightly less than that of ethiopia urbanisation population growth migration and urbanization are all straining both governments and ecosystems capacity to provide people with basic services urbanization has steadily been increasing in ethiopia with two periods of significantly rapid growth first in 19361941 during the italian occupation of mussolinis fascist regime and from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban centers tripled in 1936 italy annexed ethiopia building infrastructure to connect major cities and a dam providing power and water this along with the influx of italians and laborers was the major cause of rapid growth during this period the second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions this pattern slowed due to the 1975 land reform program instituted by the government which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas as people moved from rural areas to the cities there were fewer people to grow food for the population the land reform act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 19701983 this program proliferated the formation of peasant associations large villages based on agriculture the act did lead to an increase in food production although there is debate over the cause it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act urban populations have continued to grow with an 81 increase from 1975 to 2000 rural and urban life migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives in peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive about 16 of the population in ethiopia are living on less than 1 dollar per day 2008 only 65 of rural households in ethiopia consume the world health organizations minimum standard of food per day 2200 kilocalories with 42 of children under 5 years old being underweight most poor families 75 share their sleeping quarters with livestock and 40 of children sleep on the floor where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees celsius in the cold season the average family size is six or seven living in a 30-square-meter mud and thatch hut with less than two hectares of land to cultivate the peasant associations face a cycle of poverty since the landholdings are so small farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow which reduces soil fertility this land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock which causes low milk yields since the community burns livestock manure as fuel rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land the crop production is reduced the low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers hunger malnutrition and disease these unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further although conditions are drastically better in cities all of ethiopia suffers from poverty and poor sanitation however poverty in ethiopia fell from 44 to 296 during 20002011 according to the world bank in the capital city of addis ababa 55 of the population used to live in slums now however a construction boom in both the private and public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities particularly in addis ababa notably government-built condominium housing complexes have sprung up throughout the city benefiting close to 600000 individuals sanitation is the most pressing need in the city with most of the population lacking access to waste treatment facilities this contributes to the spread of illness through unhealthy water despite the living conditions in the cities the people of addis ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities unlike rural children 69 of urban children are enrolled in primary school and 35 of those are eligible to attend secondary school addis ababa has its own university as well as many other secondary schools the literacy rate is 82 many ngos non-governmental organizations are working to solve this problem however most are far apart uncoordinated and working in isolation the sub-saharan africa ngo consortium is attempting to coordinate efforts health the world health organizations 2006 world health report gives a figure of 1936 physicians for 2003 which comes to about 26 per 100000 globalization is said to affect the country with many educated professionals leaving ethiopia for better economic opportunities in the west ethiopias main health problems are said to be communicable contagious diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition over 44 million people more than half the population do not have access to clean water these problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities the state of public health is considerably better in the cities birth rates infant mortality rates and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education medicines and hospitals life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country in recent years the average ethiopian living to be 622 years old according to a undp report despite sanitation being a problem use of improved water sources is also on the rise 81 in cities compared to 11 in rural areas as in other parts of africa there has been a steady migration of people towards the cities in hopes of better living conditions there are 119 hospitals 12 in addis ababa alone and 412 health centers in ethiopia infant mortality rates are relatively high as 41 infants die per 1000 live births ethiopia has been able to reduce under-five mortality by two-thirds one of the millennium development goals since 1990 although this is a dramatic decrease birth-related complications such as obstetric fistula affect many of the nations women the hiv aids prevalence rate in ethiopia stood at 11 in 2014 a dramatic decrease from 45 15 years ago the most affected are poor communities and women due to lack of health education empowerment awareness and lack of social well-being the government of ethiopia and many private organizations like world health organization who and the united nations are launching campaigns and are working aggressively to improve ethiopias health conditions and promote health awareness on aids and other communicable diseases dugassa 2005 ethiopia has a relatively high infant and maternal mortality rate although ethiopia did not meet the mdg target of reducing maternal mortality rate by two thirds in 2015 there are improvements nonetheless for instance the contraception prevalence rate increased from 81 in 2000 to 418 in 2014 and antenatal care service coverage increase from 29 to an astounding 981 in the same period currently the maternal mortality rate stands at 420 per 100000 live births only a minority of ethiopians are born in hospitals while most are born in rural households those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery kater 2000 the who estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centers with adequately trained staff dorman et al 2009 p622 the low availability of health-care professionals with modern medical training together with lack of funds for medical services leads to the preponderance of less-reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments one common cultural practice irrespective of religion or economic status is female genital mutilation fgm also known as female genital cutting fgc a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons the practice has been made illegal in ethiopia in 2004 fgm is a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to northeast africa and parts of the near east that has its ultimate origins in ancient egypt encouraged by women in the community it is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault the country has a high prevalence of fgm but prevalence is lower among young girls ethiopias 2005 demographic and health survey edhs noted that the national prevalence rate is 74 among women ages 1549 the practice is almost universal in the regions of dire dawa somali and afar in the oromo and harari regions more than 80 of girls and women undergo the procedure fgc is least prevalent in the regions of tigray and gambela where 29 and 27 of girls and women respectively are affected according to a 2010 study performed by the population reference bureau ethiopia has a prevalence rate of 81 among women ages 35 to 39 and 62 among women ages 1519 a 2014 unicef report found that only 24 of girls under 14 had undergone fgm male circumcision is also practiced in the country and about 76 of ethiopias male population is reportedly circumcised the government of the federal
