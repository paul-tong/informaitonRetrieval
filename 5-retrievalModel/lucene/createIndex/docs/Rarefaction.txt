rarefaction is the reduction of an items density the opposite of compression like compression which can travel in waves sound waves for instance rarefaction waves also exist in nature a common rarefaction wave is the area of low relative pressure following a shock wave see picture rarefaction waves expand with time much like sea waves spread out as they reach a beach in most cases rarefaction waves keep the same overall profile shape at all times throughout the waves movement it is a self-similar expansion each part of the wave travels at the local speed of sound in the local medium this expansion behaviour is in contrast to the behaviour of pressure increases which gets narrower with time until they steepen into shock waves physical examples a natural example of rarefaction occurs in the layers of earths atmosphere because the atmosphere has mass most atmospheric matter is nearer to the earth due to the earths gravitation therefore air at higher layers of the atmosphere is less dense or rarefied relative to air at lower layers thus rarefaction can refer either to a reduction in density over space at a single point of time or a reduction of density over time for one particular area rarefaction can be easily observed by compressing a spring and releasing it instead of seeing compressed loops seeming to move through the spring spaced-out loops move through it rarefaction waves rarefaction in manufacturing modern construction of guitars is an example of using rarefaction in manufacturing by forcing the reduction of density loss of oils and other impurities in the cellular structure of the soundboard a rarefied guitar top produces a tonal decompression affecting the sound of the instrument mimicking aged wood see also longitudinal wave p-wave prandtlmeyer expansion fan citations
