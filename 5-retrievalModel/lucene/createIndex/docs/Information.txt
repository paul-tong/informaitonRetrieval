information is the resolution of uncertainty it is that which answers the question of what an entity is and is thus that which specifies the nature of that entity as well as the essentiality of its properties information is associated with data and knowledge as data is meaningful information and represents the values attributed to parameters and knowledge signifies understanding of an abstract or concrete concept the existence of information is uncoupled with an observer which refers to that which accesses information to discern that which it specifies information exists beyond an event horizon for example and in the case of knowledge the information itself requires a cognitive observer to be accessed in terms of communication information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation that which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right and in that sense information is always conveyed as the content of a message information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation for example information may be encoded into a sequence of signs or transmitted via a signal it can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication information reduces uncertainty the uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence and is inversely proportional to that the more uncertain an event the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event the bit is a typical unit of information but other units such as the nat may be used for example the information encoded in one fair coin flip is log221 1 bit and in two fair coin flips is log241 2 bits the concept of information has different meanings in different contexts thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception representation and entropy etymology the english word apparently derives from the latin stem information- of the nominative informatio this noun derives from the verb informare to inform in the sense of to give form to the mind to discipline instruct teach inform itself comes via french informer from the latin verb informare which means to give form or to form an idea of furthermore latin itself already contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in english is not clear the ancient greek word for form was morphe cf morph and also eidos kind idea shape set the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by plato and later aristotle to denote the ideal identity or essence of something see theory of forms eidos can also be associated with thought proposition or even concept the ancient greek word for information is which transliterates plrophoria from plrs fully and phorein frequentative of pherein to carry through it literally means bears fully or conveys fully in modern greek the word is still in daily use and has the same meaning as the word information in english in addition to its primary meaning the word as a symbol has deep roots in aristotles semiotic triangle in this regard it can be interpreted to communicate information to the one decoding that specific type of sign this is something that occurs frequently with the etymology of many words in ancient and modern greek where there is a very strong denotative relationship between the signifier eg the word symbol that conveys a specific encoded interpretation and the signified eg a concept whose meaning the interpreter attempts to decode in english information is an uncountable mass noun information theory approach in information theory information is taken as an ordered sequence of symbols from an alphabet say an input alphabet and an output alphabet information processing consists of an input-output function that maps any input sequence from into an output sequence from the mapping may be probabilistic or deterministic it may have memory or be memoryless as sensory input often information can be viewed as a type of input to an organism or system inputs are of two kinds some inputs are important to the function of the organism for example food or system energy by themselves in his book sensory ecology dusenbery called these causal inputs other inputs information are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time and perhaps another place some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input in practice information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system for example light is mainly but not only eg plants can grow in the direction of the lightsource a causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information the colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bees nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower where the bee often finds nectar or pollen which are causal inputs serving a nutritional function as representation and complexity the cognitive scientist and applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues that information is a concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense these are any dimensionally defined category of objects s and any of its subsets r r in essence is a representation of s or in other words conveys representational and hence conceptual information about s vigo then defines the amount of information that r conveys about s as the rate of change in the complexity of s whenever the objects in r are removed from s under vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation and informationfive fundamental constructs of universal scienceare unified under a novel mathematical framework among other things the framework aims to overcome the limitations of shannon-weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information as an influence that leads to transformation information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns in this sense there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive much less appreciate the pattern consider for example dna the sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind one might argue though that for a human to consciously define a pattern for example a nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind and patterns circulating due to feedback in the system can be called information in other words it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation though not created or presented for that purpose for example gregory bateson defines information as a difference that makes a difference if however the premise of influence implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge complex definitions of both information and knowledge make such semantic and logical analysis difficult but the condition of transformation is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge especially in the business discipline of knowledge management in this practice tools and processes are used to assist a knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions including steps such as review information to effectively derive value and meaning reference metadata if available establish relevant context often from many possible contexts derive new knowledge from the information make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge stewart 2001 argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise the danish dictionary of information terms argues that information only provides an answer to a posed question whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person so a generalized definition of the concept should be information an answer to a specific question when marshall mcluhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets also pheromones are often said to be information in this sense as a property in physics information has a well-defined meaning in physics in 2003 j d bekenstein claimed that a growing trend in physics was to define the physical world as being made up of information itself and thus information is defined in this way see digital physics examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light material information itself cannot travel faster than light even if that information is transmitted indirectly this could lead to all attempts at physically observing a particle with an entangled relationship to another being slowed down even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry the mathematical universe hypothesis suggests a new paradigm in which virtually everything from particles and fields through biological entities and consciousness to the multiverse itself could be described by mathematical patterns of information by the same token the cosmic void can be conceived of as the absence of material information in space setting aside the virtual particles that pop in and out of existence due to quantum fluctuations as well as the gravitational field and the dark energy nothingness can be understood then as that within which no matter energy space time or any other type of information could exist which would be possible if symmetry and structure break within the manifold of the multiverse ie the manifold would have tears or holes another link is demonstrated by the maxwells demon thought experiment in this experiment a direct relationship between information and another physical property entropy is demonstrated a consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system in practical terms this often means generating heat another more philosophical outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy toyabe et al experimentally showed in nature that information can be converted into work thus in the study of logic gates the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an and gate is higher than for the not gate because information is destroyed in an and gate and simply converted in a not gate physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers in thermodynamics information is any kind of event that affects the state of a dynamic system that can interpret the information the application of information study the information cycle addressed as a whole or in its distinct components is of great concern to information technology information systems as well as information science these fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture through sensors and generation through computation formulation or composition processing including encoding encryption compression packaging transmission including all telecommunication methods presentation including visualization display methods storage such as magnetic or optical including holographic methods etc information does not cease to exist it may only get scrambled beyond any

technologically mediated information it is estimated that the worlds technological capacity to store information grew from 26 optimally compressed exabytes in 1986 which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-mb cd-rom per person 539 mb per person to 295 optimally compressed exabytes in 2007 this is the informational equivalent of almost 61 cd-rom per person in 2007 the worlds combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007 the worlds combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007 as of 2007 an estimated 90 of all new information is digital mostly stored on hard drives as records records are specialized forms of information essentially records are information produced consciously or as by-products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required the international standard on records management iso 15489 defines records as information created received and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business the international committee on archives ica committee on electronic records defined a record as recorded information produced or received in the initiation conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered six key requirements for good corporate governancetransparency accountability due process compliance meeting statutory and common law requirements and security of personal and corporate information semiotics michael buckland has classified information in terms of its uses information as process information as knowledge and information as thing beynon-davies explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels layers or branches of semiotics pragmatics semantics syntax and empirics these four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used the focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour in other words pragmatics link language to action semantics is concerned with the meaning of a message conveyed in a communicative act semantics considers the content of communication semantics is the study of the meaning of signs - the association between signs and behaviour semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent a message syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign-systems nielsen 2008 discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries he introduces the concept of lexicographic information costs and refers to the effort a user of a dictionary must make to first find and then understand data so that they can generate information communication normally exists within the context of some social situation the social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed pragmatics and the form of communication in a communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter-related signs taken from a language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax syntactics and semantics the sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel empirics the chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place and over what distance see also abstraction accuracy and precision anti-information reduces
