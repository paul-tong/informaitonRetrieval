the review of united states human space flight plans committee also known as the hsf committee augustine commission or augustine committee was a group reviewing the human spaceflight plans of the united states their goal was to ensure the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space the review was announced by the office of science and technology policy ostp on may 7 2009 it covered human spaceflight options after the time nasa had planned to retire the space shuttle a summary report was provided to the ostp director john holdren white house office of science and technology policy ostp and nasa administrator on september 8 2009 the estimated cost associated with the review was expected to be us3 million the committee was scheduled to be active for 180 days the report was released on october 22 2009 objectives the review was commissioned to take into account several objectives these included support for the international space station development of missions beyond low earth orbit including the moon mars and near-earth objects and use of commercial space industry these objectives must fit within a defined budget profile among the parameters that were considered in the course of the review were crew and mission safety life-cycle costs development time national space industrial base impacts potential to spur innovation and encourage competition and the implications and impacts of transitioning from current human space flight systems the review considered the appropriate amounts of research and development and complementary robotic activity necessary to support various human space flight activities it was tasked to also explore options for extending international space station operations beyond 2016 budget limits the statement of task defines the fiscal year 20102014 budget profile in millions of us for nasas exploration program as the fiscal year 2009 budget projection for exploration had been a subcommittee in the house of representatives has announced a plan to cut the 2010 budget from us39631 million to 32932 million a cut of 6699 million or 169 chairman alan mollohan stated the cut was a pause and time-out caused by the review of human space flight findings the committee has concluded that the ultimate goal of human exploration is to chart a path for human expansion into the solar system it also observed that destinations should derive from goals and human spaceflight objectives should broadly align with key national objectives destinations beyond low earth orbit that were considered by the committee include the moon mars and near-earth objects as well as the moons of mars phobos and deimos among these the committee felt that mars stands prominently above all other opportunities for exploration because if humans are ever to live for long periods on another planetary surface it is likely to be on mars the committees final report mentions the possibility of evaluating near-earth objects for their utility as sites for mining of in-situ resources the committee judged the 9-year old constellation program to be so behind schedule underfunded and over budget that meeting any of its goals would not be possible president obama removed the program from the 2010 budget effectively canceling the program one component of the program the orion crew capsule was added back to plans but as a rescue vehicle to complement the russian soyuz in returning station crews to earth in the event of an emergency the proposed ultimate goal for human space flight would appear to require two basic objectives 1 physical sustainability and 2 economic sustainability the committee adds a third objective to meet key national objectives these might include international cooperation developing new industries energy independence reducing climate change national prestige etc therefore the ideal destination should contain resources such as water to sustain life also providing oxygen for breathing and hydrogen to combine with oxygen for rocket fuel and precious and industrial metals and other resources that may be of value for space construction and perhaps in some cases worth returning to earth eg see asteroid mining some of these resources are available on mars and perhaps on the moon but the committee report noted the cost and difficulty of travel into the deep gravity wells of the lunar and martian surface it did not emphasize options such as asteroid mining other than the one mention noted above or space-based solar power the committee report did favor strengthening the private space launch industry and increased international collaboration in its final report the committee proposed three basic options for exploration beyond low earth orbit and appeared to favor the third option mars first with a mars landing perhaps after a brief test of equipment and procedures on the moon moon first with lunar surface exploration focused on developing the capability to explore mars a flexible path to inner solar system locations such as lunar orbit lagrange points near-earth objects and the moons of mars followed by exploration of the lunar surface andor martian surface optionally involving the development of a propellant depot obamas choice for the future of the us program the review aimed to examine ongoing and planned national aeronautics and space administration nasa development activities as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe innovative affordable and sustainable human space flight program in the years following space shuttle retirement the panel was to work closely with nasa and will seek input from the united states congress the white house the public industry and international partners as it develops its options it is to present its results in time to support an administration decision on the way forward by august 2009 on april 15 2010 president obama spoke at the kennedy space center announcing the administrations plans for nasa none of the three plans outlined in the committees final report were completely selected the president promised 6 billion in additional funding over five years continued investment in private space to provide low earth orbit access continued funding for a solar atmosphere probe became the parker solar probe further mars robotic missions and a follow-on orbital telescope james webb space telescope extend the life of the international space station to 2020 allowing it to be used for scientific research design of a new heavy lift rocket to be ready to start construction in 2015 in order to launch astronauts and material for beyond earth orbit access manned flights using the new launcher in the early 2020s a manned mission to an asteroid in the mid-2020s manned missions to mars orbit by the mid-2030s obama specifically rejected going back to the moon saying frankly weve been there instead a set a series of ever-more-challenging goals to

also serves as chairman of the national academies committee on the rationale and goals of the us civil space program led the international and interagency integration subgroup that committee expected to release its final report july 31 2009 the shuttle and international space station subgroup was led by dr ride mr bejmuk led the access to low earth orbit subgroup and professor crawley leads the
