the orion arm is a minor spiral arm of the milky way some 3500 light-years 1100 parsecs across and approximately 10000 light-years 3100 parsecs in length containing the solar system including the earth it is also referred to by its full name the orioncygnus arm as well as local arm orion bridge and formerly the local spur and orion spur the arm is named for the orion constellation which is one of the most prominent constellations of northern hemisphere winter southern hemisphere summer some of the brightest stars and most famous celestial objects of the constellation eg betelgeuse rigel the three stars of orions belt the orion nebula are within it as shown on the interactive map below the arm is between the carinasagittarius arm the local portions of which are toward the galactic center and the perseus arm the local portion of which is the main outer-most arm and one of two major arms of the galaxy long thought to be a minor structure namely a spur between the two arms mentioned evidence was presented in mid 2013 that our arm might be a branch of the perseus arm or possibly an independent arm segment within the arm the solar system is close to its inner rim in a relative cavity in the arms interstellar medium known as the local bubble about halfway along the arms length approximately 8000 parsecs 26000 light-years from the galactic center messier objects the orion arm contains a number of messier objects the butterfly cluster m6 the ptolemy cluster m7 open cluster m23 open cluster m25 the dumbbell nebula m27 open cluster m29 open cluster m34 open cluster m35 open cluster m39 winnecke 4 m40 open cluster m41 the orion nebula m42 the de mairans nebula the beehive cluster m44 the pleiades m45 open cluster m46 open cluster m47 open cluster m48 open cluster m50 the ring nebula m57 open cluster m67 m73 the little dumbbell nebula m76 diffuse nebula m78 open cluster m93 the owl nebula m97 interactive maps see also gould belt jon lombergs milky way painting used as background for kepler mission diagram showing our location on the orion spur local bubble loop i bubble list of messier objects list of nearest stars and brown dwarfs messier objects in the milky way seds a 3d map of the milky way galaxy astronomy portal space portal
