the great dark spot also known as gds-89 for great dark spot - 1989 was one of a series of dark spots on neptune similar in appearance to jupiters great red spot gds-89 was the first great dark spot on neptune to be observed in 1989 by nasas voyager 2 spaceprobe like jupiters spot great dark spots are anticyclonic storms however their interiors are relatively cloud-free and unlike jupiters spot which has lasted for hundreds of years their lifetimes appear to be shorter forming and dissipating once every few years or so based on observations taken with voyager 2 and since then with the hubble space telescope neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a great dark spot characteristics the dark elliptically-shaped spot with initial dimensions of 13000 6600km or 8100 4100mi of gds-89 was about the same size as earth and was similar in general appearance to jupiters great red spot around it winds were measured blowing up to 2400 kilometers 1500mi an hour the fastest in the solar system the great dark spot is thought to represent a hole in the methane cloud deck of neptune the spot was observed at different times with different sizes and shapes the great dark spot generated large white clouds at or just below the tropopause layer similar to high-altitude cirrus clouds found on earth unlike the clouds on earth however which are composed of crystals of ice neptunes cirrus clouds are made up of crystals of frozen methane and while cirrus clouds usually form and then disperse within a period of a few hours the clouds in the great dark spot were still present after 36 hours or two rotations of the planet neptunes dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter upper cloud deck features as they are stable features that can persist for several months they are thought to be vortex structures disappearance when the spot was to be photographed again in november 1994 by the hubble space telescope it had disappeared completely leaving astronomers to believe that it has either been covered up or vanished the persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanisms however in 2016 an almost identical spot emerged in neptunes northern hemisphere this new spot called the northern great dark spot ngds has remained visible for several years it is unknown whether this spot is still present on the planet as observations using the hubble telescope are limited see also dragon storm astronomy extraterrestrial cyclone great red spot oval ba small dark spot neptunes great dark spot of 1989 windows to the universe neptunes great dark spot gone but not forgotten astronomy picture of the day may 8 1996
