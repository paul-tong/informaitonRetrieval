luna 10 e-6s series was a 1966 soviet luna program robotic spacecraft mission also called lunik 10 it was the first artificial satellite of the moon the spacecraft scientific instruments included a gamma-ray spectrometer for energies between 033 mev 50500 pj a triaxial magnetometer a meteorite detector instruments for solar-plasma studies and devices for measuring infrared emissions from the moon and radiation conditions of the lunar environment gravitational studies were also conducted luna 10 conducted extensive research in lunar orbit gathering important data on the strength of the moons magnetic field its radiation belts and the nature of lunar rocks which were found to be comparable to terrestrial basalt rocks cosmic radiation and micrometeoroid density perhaps its most important finding was the first evidence of mass concentrations called masconsareas of high density below the mare basins that distort lunar orbital trajectories their discovery has usually been credited to the american lunar orbiter series the flight the luna 10 spacecraft was launched towards the moon from an earth orbiting platform on march 31 1966 the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on april 3 1966 and completed its first orbit 3 hours later on april 4 moscow time after a midcourse correction on 1 april luna 10 the second of two hastily prepared soviet ye-6s probes that is the backup successfully entered lunar orbit two days later at 1844 ut a 245-kilogram instrument compartment separated from the main bus which was in a 350 x 1000-kilometer orbit inclined at 719 to the lunar equator luna 10 was battery powered and operated for 460 lunar orbits and 219 active data transmissions before radio signals were discontinued on may 30 1966 the internationale the spacecraft carried a set of solid-state oscillators that had been programmed to reproduce the notes of the internationale so that it could be broadcast live to the 23rd congress of the communist party of the soviet union during a rehearsal on the night of 3 april the playback went well but the following morning controllers discovered a missing note and played the previous nights tape to the assembled gathering at the congressclaiming it was a live broadcast from the moon launch datetime 1966-03-31 at 104800 utc on-orbit dry mass 540kg spaceflight portal zarya - luna 10 chronology
