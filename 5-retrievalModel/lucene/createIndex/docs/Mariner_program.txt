the mariner program was a 10-mission program conducted by the american space agency nasa in conjunction with jet propulsion laboratory jpl the program launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes from 1962 to 1973 designed to investigate mars venus and mercury the program included a number of firsts including the first planetary flyby the first planetary orbiter and the first gravity assist maneuver of the ten vehicles in the mariner series seven were successful forming the starting point for many subsequent nasajpl space probe programs the planned mariner jupiter-saturn vehicles were adapted into the voyager program while the viking program orbiters were enlarged versions of the mariner 9 spacecraft later mariner-based spacecraft include the magellan probe and the galileo probe while the second-generation mariner mark ii series evolved into the cassinihuygens probe the total cost of the mariner program was approximately 554 million the name of the mariner program was decided in may 1960-at the suggestion of edgar m cortright to have the planetary mission probes patterned after nautical terms to convey the impression of travel to great distances and remote lands that decision was the basis for naming mariner ranger surveyor and viking probes basic layout all mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal bus which housed all of the electronics and to which all components were attached such as antennae cameras propulsion and power sources mariner 2 was based on the ranger lunar probe all of the mariners launched after mariner 2 had four solar panels for power except for mariner 10 which had two additionally all except mariner 1 mariner 2 and mariner 5 had tv cameras the first five mariners were launched on atlas-agena rockets while the last five used the atlas-centaur all mariner-based probes after mariner 10 used the titan iiie titan iv unmanned rockets or the space shuttle with a solid-fueled inertial upper stage and multiple planetary flybys mariners mariner 1 mariner 2 mariner 3 mariner 4 mariner 5 mariner 6 mariner 7 mariner 8 mariner 9 mariner 10 mariners 1 and 2 mariner 1 p-37 and mariner 2 p-38 were two deep-space probes making up nasas mariner-r project the primary goal of the project was to develop and launch two spacecraft sequentially to the near vicinity of venus receive communications from the spacecraft and to perform radiometric temperature measurements of the planet a secondary objective was to make interplanetary magnetic field andor particle measurements on the way to and in the vicinity of venus mariner 1 designated mariner r-1 was launched on july 22 1962 but was destroyed approximately 5 minutes after liftoff by the air force range safety officer when its malfunctioning atlas-agena rocket went off course mariner 2 designated mariner r-2 was launched on august 27 1962 sending it on a 3-month flight to venus the mission was a success and mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to have flown by another planet mission venus flyby weight 203kg 446lb sensors microwave and infrared radiometers cosmic dust solar plasma and high-energy radiation magnetic fields status mariner 1 destroyed shortly after liftoff mariner 2 defunct after successful mission occupies a heliocentric orbit mariners 3 and 4 sisterships mariner 3 and mariner 4 were mars flyby missions mariner 3 was lost when the launch vehicles nose fairing failed to jettison mariner 4 launched on november 28 1964 was the first successful flyby of the planet mars and gave the first glimpse of mars at close range mission mars

launched to venus on june 14 1967 and arrived in the vicinity of the planet in october 1967 it carried a complement of experiments to probe venus atmosphere with radio waves scan its brightness in ultraviolet light and sample the solar particles and magnetic field fluctuations above the planet mission venus flyby mass 245kg 540lb sensors ultraviolet photometer cosmic dust solar plasma trapped

two-spacecraft mission to mars mariner 6 was launched on february 24 1969 followed by mariner 7 on march 21 1969 they flew over the equator and southern hemisphere of the planet mars mission mars

mariner 6 defunct now in a heliocentric orbit mariner 7 defunct now in a heliocentric orbit mariners 8 and 9 mariner 8 and mariner 9 were identical sister craft designed to map the martian surface simultaneously but mariner 8 was lost in a launch vehicle failure its identical sister craft mariner 9 was launched in may 1971 and became the first artificial satellite of mars it entered martian orbit in november 1971 and began photographing the surface and analyzing the atmosphere with its infrared and ultraviolet instruments mission orbit mars mass 998kg 2200lb sensors wide- and

november 3 1973 and was the first to use a gravity assist trajectory accelerating as it entered the gravitational influence of venus then being flung by the planets gravity onto a slightly different course to reach mercury it was also the first spacecraft to encounter two planets at close range and for 33 years the only spacecraft to photograph mercury in closeup mission plasma charged particles magnetic fields radio occultation and celestial mechanics status mariner 10 defunct now in a heliocentric orbit mariner jupiter-saturn mariner jupiter-saturn was approved in 1972 after the cancellation of the grand tour program which proposed visiting all the outer planets with multiple spacecraft the mariner jupiter-saturn program proposed two mariner-derived probes that would perform a scaled back mission involving flybys of only the two gas giants though designers at jpl built the craft with the intention that further encounters past saturn would be an option trajectories were chosen to allow one probe to visit jupiter and saturn first and perform a flyby of saturns moon titan to gather information about the moons substantial atmosphere the other probe would arrive at jupiter and saturn later and its trajectory would enable it to continue on to uranus and neptune assuming the first probe accomplished all its objectives or be redirected to perform a titan flyby if necessary the programs name was changed to voyager just before launch in 1977 and after voyager 1 successfully completed its titan encounter voyager 2 went on to visit the two ice giants see also
