diogo fernandes pereira sometimes called simply diogo fernandes was a portuguese 16th-century navigator originally from setbal portugal diogo fernandes was the first known european captain to visit the island of socotra in 1503 and the discoverer of the mascarenes archipelago runion mauritius and rodrigues in 1507 he may also have been the first european to sail east of madagascar island outer route to the east indies background diogo fernandes pereiras name is usually given simply as diogo fernandes he is sometimes referred to as diogo fernandes de setbal his hometown to distinguish him from another indian ocean adventurer of that period with a similar name known as diogo fernandes de beja in older chronicles eg damio de gis his name is also written as diogo fernandes piteira or peteira diogo fernandes was a portuguese seaman of obscure background according to joo de barros he was a native of setbal a man much used at sea muito usado no mar he served as master on several ships - that is as third officer below the pilot and captain a position which required trained navigational expertise and may have served as pilot on other occasions outer route and socotra 1503 in 1503 diogo fernandes pereira was appointed master and captain a very unusual combination of a setbal ship bound for india how a master was elevated to captain of an india nau usually a position reserved for nobles or wealthy men who paid for the privilege is uncertain one possible conjecture is that the ship was not a crown ship but a privately outfitted ship in some secondary accounts it is said that diogo fernandess ship was named setbal that is almost certainly incorrect known lists for the armada and the chronicles do not actually give his ship a name but just call it the ship fromof setbal a strong suggestion that it might have been privately outfitted by the merchant community of the city of setbal if so that might better explain how diogo fernandes got to be captain - the merchants of setbal just naturally chose to entrust their capital in their most knowledgeable and experienced native son diogo fernandess setbal ship was made part of the 5th portuguese india armada of afonso de albuquerque fernandes was originally assigned to the third squadron of that fleet under the vice-admiral antnio de saldanha but navigational errors on saldanhas part led to the separation of the ships shortly after cape verde diogo fernandes was forced to sail on alone the chronicler gaspar correia p418 claims that after doubling the cape of good hope by himself fernandes did not turn into the mozambique channel but rather pushed east sailing under the island of madagascar and then turned north sailing up east of madagascar this would make him the first known ship to sail the outer route to the east indies although there remains the possibility that diogo dias also did precisely that in 1500 although correias account is not corroborated by other chroniclers diogo fernandes pereira seems to almost certainly have missed mozambique island the usual collection point for portuguese ships and where one of his squadron rui loureno ravasco was known to be waiting instead we next hear of fernandes up near cape guardafui which strongly suggests that he did take the outer route as sailing north by that route he would not have sighted african coast before the horn around cape guardafui diogo fernandes stumbled on the island of socotra sometime in late 1503 although the island was long known to eastern merchants socotra aloe was a highly valued balm in the markets of arabia and india it was unknown to the portuguese diogo fernandes was also surprised to encounter a strong syriac christian community on the island after all this was a predominantly muslim region diogo fernandes spent the winter in socotra before crossing the indian ocean again by himself in early 1504 diogo fernandes arrived in india just as the zamorin of calicut was launching an invasion of portuguese-allied cochin during the ferocious battle of cochin 1504 the commander of the portuguese garrison duarte pacheco pereira is said to have placed a certain diogo pereira possibly diogo fernandes in charge of the nau concepo protecting the city mascarenes 1507 diogo fernandes returned to portugal in 1505 his report on socotra generated much excitement in the portuguese court the strategic placement of the island at the mouth of the red sea made it an optimal location to station a portuguese patrol it could prey on arab shipping and shut down the competing spice trade through that route the existence of the isolated christian community only made it even more appealing the portuguese had long hoped to find a christian port of call in the muslim-dominated indian ocean plans were immediately launched to outfit a squadron under the command of afonso de albuquerque to seize the island for portugal the socotra squadron was adjoined to the 8th armada of 1506 led by tristo da cunha diogo fernandes himself sailed on it albeit only as a master of albuquerques ship the cisne the swan usually transcribed as cirn in late 1506 when the 8th armada made the usual stop in mozambique island the admiral tristo da cunha ordered a pause in the expedition to explore the island of madagascar then known as the ilha de so loureno during this interlude it is speculated that albuquerque uninterested in such exploratory ventures elected to stay in mozambique and temporarily passed his ship the cirn over to the command of the master diogo fernandes pereira diogo fernandes is said to have struck a wide arc east of madagascar and stumbled upon the island of runion which he promptly named ilha de santa apollonia in honor of the st apollonia whos day it was february 9 1507 he proceeded east to discover the island of mauritius which he named ilha do cirne the name of his ship from there fernandes went further east and discovered the island now known as rodrigues but which at the time was named on maps as the ilha de diogo fernandes domigo friz or domingo frias the latter two probably just poor cartographic transcriptions or abbreviations of diogo fernandes he is said to have stopped for water at the first and third islands before returning to mozambique diogo fernandes island domigo friz was visited by diogo lopes de sequeira in 1509 and the name don galopes another transcribed abbreviation sometimes appears for that island in some maps it went through its final name change to rodrigues island much later after another portuguese explorer diogo rodrigues visited the area in 1528 the entire archipelago was named the mascarenes islands after d pedro mascarenhas who visited the islands in 1512 following up on sequeiras report afterwards after returning from his mascarene jaunt diogo fernandes pereira went on to participate with albuquerque in the conquest of socotra that summer we have no more records of him afterwards if diogo fernandes remained aboard the cirne after socotra he would have participated in the battle of hormuz in the fall of 1507 but we have no record of him there more importantly we have no record of his participation or non-participation in the mutiny against albuquerque at hormuz we do know albuquerque elevated a certain dinis fernandes to replace one of the mutinous captains and we also know a certain diogo pereira was involved in presenting the mutinous captains petition to the vice-roy in cochin but there is no evidence or suggestion that either of these men can be identified with diogo fernandes pereira notes
