the voskhod programme russian ipavsxot ascent or dawn was the second soviet human spaceflight project two one-day manned missions were flown using the voskhod spacecraft and rocket one in 1964 and one in 1965 and two dogs flew on a 22-day mission in 1966 voskhod development was both a follow-on to the vostok programme and a recycling of components left over from that programmes cancellation following its first six flights the voskhod programme was superseded by the soyuz programme design the voskhod spacecraft was basically a vostok spacecraft that had a backup solid-fueled retrorocket added to the top of the descent module as it was much heavier the launch vehicle would be the 11a57 a molniya 8k78m with the blok l stage removed and later the basis of the soyuz booster the ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the vostok crew position however the position of the in-flight controls was not changed so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments in the case of voskhod 2 an inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch the airlock was jettisoned after use this apparatus was needed because the vehicle avionics and environmental systems were air-cooled and depressurization in orbit would cause overheating a solid-fueled braking rocket was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown this was necessary because unlike the vostok the voskhod descent module landed with the crewmen still inside unlike vostok and the later soyuz voskhod had no launch abort system meaning that the crew lacked any means of escape from a malfunctioning launch vehicle voskhod had a solid-fueled backup retrorocket on top of the capsule in case the main one failed as it did on voskhod 2 while vostok lacked this feature it was not considered a problem since the spacecraft would decay from orbit within 10 days relatively lightweight voskhod was well below the 11a57 boosters lift capacity meaning that it launched into a much higher orbit and would not decay as quickly flights the voskhod flights with launch dates unmanned kosmos 47 unmanned test flight of the voskhod hardware kosmos 57 unmanned test flight unsuccessful kosmos 110 unmanned sent two dogs veterok and ugolyok on a 22-day flight launched 22 february 1966 and landed 16 march manned cancelled voskhod 3 19-day two-man mission to study long-term weightlessness with artificial gravity medical military and other experiments 1 voskhod 4 20-day single-man mission to study long-term weightlessness with artificial gravity medical military and other experiments 2 voskhod 5 10-day two-woman mission with medical and other experiments and first female eva-spacewalk 3 voskhod 6 15-day two-man mission with military and other experiments and multiple spacewalks to test new eva jet belt 4 results while the vostok programme was dedicated more toward understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body voskhods two flights were more aimed towards spectacular firsts although achieving the first eva spacewalk became the main success of the programme beating the us project gemini to put the first multiman crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the programme after those goals were realized the programme planned to focus on other advances the spacecraft could accomplish such as longer duration and a second female flight however there were delays preparing for voskhod 3 and during that time the gemini programme accomplished most of what had been planned for future voskhods in the end the voskhod programme was abandoned aided by a change in soviet leadership which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights and this allowed the soviet designers to concentrate on the soyuz programme voskhod manned space project on encyclopedia astronautica coordinates 455501n 631959e 45917n 63333e 45917 63333
