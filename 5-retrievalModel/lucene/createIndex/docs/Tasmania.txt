tasmania tzmeni abbreviated as tas and known colloquially as tassie is an island state of australia it is located 240km 150mi to the south of the australian mainland separated by bass strait the state encompasses the main island of tasmania the 26th-largest island in the world and the surrounding 334 islands the state has a population of around 526700 as of march2018 just over forty percent of the population resides in the greater hobart precinct which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city hobart tasmanias area is 68401km 26410sqmi of which the main island covers 64519km 24911sqmi it is promoted as a natural state and protected areas of tasmania cover about 42 of its land area which includes national parks and world heritage sites tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world the island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30000 years before british colonisation it is thought aboriginal tasmanians were separated from the mainland aboriginal groups about 10000 years ago when the sea rose to form bass strait the aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3000 and 7000 at the time of colonisation but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the black war intertribal conflict and from the late 1820s the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity the conflict which peaked between 1825 and 1831 and led to more than three years of martial law cost the lives of almost 1100 aboriginals and settlers the island was permanently settled by europeans in 1803 as a penal settlement of the british empire to prevent claims to the land by the first french empire during the napoleonic wars the island was initially part of the colony of new south wales but became a separate self-governing colony under the name van diemens land named after anthony van diemen in 1825 approximately 75000 convicts were sent to van diemens land before transportation ceased in 1853 in 1854 the present constitution of tasmania was passed and the following year the colony received permission to change its name to tasmania in 1901 it became a state through the process of the federation of australia toponymy the state is named after dutch explorer abel tasman who made the first reported european sighting of the island on 24 november 1642 tasman named the island anthony van diemens land after his sponsor anthony van diemen the governor of the dutch east indies the name was later shortened to van diemens land by the british it was officially renamed tasmania in honour of its first european discoverer on 1 january 1856 tasmania was sometimes referred to as dervon as mentioned in the jerilderie letter written by the notorious australian bushranger ned kelly in 1879 the colloquial expression for the state is tassie tasmania is also colloquially shortened to tas mainly when used in business names and website addresses tas is also the australia post abbreviation for the state the reconstructed palawa kani language name for tasmania is lutriwita history physical history the island was adjoined to the mainland of australia until the end of the last glacial period about 10000 years ago much of the island is composed of jurassic dolerite intrusions the upwelling of magma through other rock types sometimes forming large columnar joints tasmania has the worlds largest areas of dolerite with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type the central plateau and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites mount wellington above hobart is a good example showing distinct columns known as the organ pipes in the southern midlands as far south as hobart the dolerite is underlaid by sandstone and similar sedimentary stones in the southwest precambrian quartzites were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges such as federation peak or frenchmans cap in the northeast and east continental granites can be seen such as at freycinet similar to coastal granites on mainland australia in the northwest and west mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at mount read near rosebery or at mount lyell near queenstown also present in the south and northwest is limestone with caves the quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of glaciation and much of australias glaciated landscape is found on the central plateau and the southwest cradle mountain another dolerite peak for example was a nunatak the combination of these different rock types contributes to scenery which is distinct from any other region of the world in the far southwest corner of the state the geology is almost wholly quartzite which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round indigenous people evidence indicates the presence of aborigines in tasmania about 42000years ago rising sea levels cut tasmania off from mainland australia about 10000years ago and by the time of european contact the aboriginal people in tasmania had nine major nations or ethnic groups at the time of the british occupation and colonisation in 1803 the indigenous population was estimated at between 3000 and 10000 historian lyndall ryans analysis of population studies led her to conclude that there were about 7000 spread throughout the islands nine nations nicholas clements citing research by njb plomley and rhys jones settled on a figure of 3000 to 4000 they engaged in fire-stick farming hunted game including kangaroo and wallabies caught seals mutton-birds shellfish and fish and lived as nine separate nations on the island which they knew as trouwunna european arrival and governance the first reported sighting of tasmania by a european was on 24 november 1642 by dutch explorer abel tasman who landed at todays blackman bay more than a century later in 1772 a french expedition led by marc-joseph marion du fresne landed at nearby but different blackmans bay and the following year tobias furneaux became the first englishman to land in tasmania when he arrived at adventure bay captain james cook landed at adventure bay in 1777 matthew flinders and george bass sailed through bass strait in 179899 determining for the first time that tasmania was an island sealers and whalers based themselves on tasmanias islands from 1798 and in august 1803 new south wales governor philip king sent lieutenant john bowen to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the derwent river in order to forestall any claims to the island by french explorers who had been exploring the southern australian coastline bowen who led a party of 49 including 21 male and three female convicts named the camp risdon several months later a second settlement was established by captain david collins with 308 convicts 5 kilometres 31mi to the south in sullivans cove on the western side of the derwent where fresh water was more plentiful the latter settlement became known as hobart town or hobarton later shortened to hobart after the british colonial secretary of the time lord hobart the settlement at risdon was later abandoned left on their own without further supplies the sullivans cove settlement suffered severe food shortages and by 1806 its inhabitants were starving with many resorting to scraping seaweed off rocks and scavenging washed-up whale blubber from the shore to survive a smaller colony was established at port dalrymple on the tamar river in the islands north in october 1804 and several other convict-based settlements were established including the particularly harsh penal colonies at port arthur in the southeast and macquarie harbour on the west coast tasmania was eventually sent 75000 convictsfour out of every ten people transported to australia by 1819 the aboriginal and british population reached parity with about 5000 of each although among the colonists men outnumbered women four to one wealthy middle-class free settlers began arriving in large numbers from 1820 lured by the promise of land grants and free convict labour settlement in the islands northwest corner was monopolised by the van diemens land company which sent its first surveyors to the district in 1826 by 1830 one-third of australias non-indigenous population lived in van diemens land and the island accounted for about half of all land under cultivation and exports black war tensions between tasmanias black and white inhabitants rose partly driven by increasing competition for kangaroo and other game explorer and naval officer john oxley in 1810 noted the many atrocious cruelties inflicted on aboriginals by convict bushrangers in the north which in turn led to black attacks on solitary white hunters hostilities increased further with the arrival of 600 colonists from norfolk island between 1807 and 1813 they established farms along the river derwent and east and west of launceston occupying 10 percent of van diemens land by 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12600 while the islands sheep population had reached 200000 the rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with grazing livestock as well as fences hedges and stone walls while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers violence began to spiral rapidly from the mid-1820s in what became known as the black war while black inhabitants were driven to desperation by dwindling food supplies as well as anger at the prevalence of abductions of women and girls whites carried out attacks as a means of exacting revenge and suppressing the native threat van diemens land had an enormous gender imbalance with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822and 16 to one among the convict population historian nicholas clements has suggested the voracious appetite for native women was the most important trigger for the explosion of violence from the late 1820s from 1825 to 1828 the number of native attacks more than doubled each year raising panic among settlers over the summer of 18267 clans from the big river oyster bay and north midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and made it clear that they wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds settlers responded vigorously resulting in many mass-killings in november 1826 governor george arthur issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill aborigines when they attacked settlers or their property and in the following eight months more than 200 aborigines were killed in the settled districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists after another eight months the death toll had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 aboriginals almost 300 british troops were sent into the settled districts and in november 1828 arthur declared martial law giving soldiers the right to shoot on sight any aboriginal in the settled districts martial law would remain in force for more than three years the longest period of martial law in australian history in november 1830 arthur organised the so-called black line ordering every able-bodied male colonist to assemble at one of seven designated places in the settled districts to join a massive drive to sweep aboriginals out of the region and on to the tasman peninsula the campaign failed and was abandoned seven weeks later but by then tasmanias aboriginal population had fallen to about 300 removal of aborigines after hostilities between settlers and aboriginals ceased in 1832 almost all of the remnants of the indigenous population were persuaded or forced by government agent george augustus robinson to move to flinders island many quickly succumbed to infectious diseases to which they had no immunity reducing the population further of those removed from tasmania the last to die was truganini in 1876 the near-destruction of tasmanias aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians including robert hughes james boyce lyndall ryan and tom lawson boyce has claimed that the april 1828 proclamation separating the aborigines from the white inhabitants sanctioned force against aboriginals for no other reason than that they were aboriginal and described the decision to remove all tasmanian aborigines after 1832by which time they had given up their fight against white colonistsas an extreme policy position he concluded the colonial government from 1832 to 1838 ethnically cleansed the western half of van diemens land and then callously left the exiled people to their fate proclamation as a separate colony van diemens landwhich thus far had existed as a territory within the colony of new south waleswas proclaimed a separate colony with its own judicial establishment and legislative council on 3 december 1825 transportation to the island ceased in 1853 and the colony was renamed tasmania in 1856 partly to differentiate the burgeoning society of free settlers from the islands convict past the legislative council of van diemens land drafted a new constitution which it passed in 1854 the following year the privy council approved the colony changing its name from van diemens land to tasmania and in 1856 the newly elected bicameral parliament sat for the first time establishing tasmania as a self-governing colony of the british empire the colony suffered from economic fluctuations but for the most part was prosperous experiencing steady growth with few external threats and strong trade links with the empire tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding it raised a local defence force that eventually played a significant role in the second boer war in south africa and tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two victoria crosses awarded to australians in 1901 the colony of tasmania united with the five other australian colonies to form the commonwealth of australia tasmanians voted in favour of federation with the largest majority of all the australian colonies recent history the state was badly affected by the 1967 tasmanian fires in which there was major loss of life and property in the 1970s the state government announced plans to flood environmentally significant lake pedder as a result of the eventual flooding of lake pedder the worlds first greens party was established the united tasmania group in 1975 the tasman bridge collapsed when the bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier mv lake illawarra it was the only bridge in hobart and made crossing the derwent river by road at the city impossible the nearest bridge was approximately 20 kilometres 12mi to the north at bridgewater national and international attention surrounded the campaign against the franklin dam in the early 1980s on 28 april 1996 in the incident now known as the port arthur massacre lone gunman martin bryant shot and killed 35 people including tourists and residents and injured 21 others the use of firearms was immediately reviewed and new gun ownership laws were adopted nationwide with tasmanias law one of the strictest in australia in april 2006 the beaconsfield mine collapse was triggered by a small earthquake one person was killed and two others were trapped underground for 14 days the tasmanian community has for some time been divided over the issue of the proposed bell bay pulp mill to be built in the tamar valley proponents argue that jobs will be created while opponents argue that pollution will damage both the bass strait fishing industry and local tourism the company behind the proposal collapsed in 2012 and the pulp mill project officially ended in 2017 when the building permits lapsed in january 2011 philanthropist david walsh opened the museum of old and new art mona in hobart to international acclaim within 12 months mona became tasmanias top tourism attraction geography tasmanias landmass of 68401km 26410sqmi is located directly in the pathway of the notorious roaring forties wind that encircles the globe to its north it is separated from mainland australia by bass strait tasmania is the only australian state that is not located on the australian mainland about 2500 kilometres 1600 mi south of tasmania island lies antarctica tasmania is in fact geographically closer to antarctica than it is to parts of the northern australian mainland depending on which borders of the oceans are used the island can be said to be either surrounded by the southern ocean or to have the pacific on its east and the indian to its west still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have tasmania with the great australian bight to the west and the tasman sea to the east it lies at similar latitudes to the south island of new zealand and parts of patagonia in south america tasmania has been volcanically inactive in recent geological times but has many jagged peaks resulting from recent glaciation tasmania is the most mountainous state in australia the most mountainous region is the central highlands area which covers most of the central western parts of the state the midlands located in the central east is fairly flat and is predominantly used for agriculture although farming activity is scattered throughout the state tasmanias tallest mountain is mount ossa at 1617m 5305ft the mountain lies in the heart of the world-famous cradle mountain-lake st clair national park much of tasmania is still densely forested with the southwest national park and neighbouring areas holding some of the last temperate rain forests in the southern hemisphere the tarkine containing savage river national park located in the islands far north west is the largest temperate rainforest area in australia covering about 3800 square kilometres 1500sqmi with its rugged topography tasmania has a great number of rivers several of tasmanias largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide hydroelectricity many rivers begin in the central highlands and flow out to the coast tasmanias major population centres are mainly situated around estuaries some of which are named rivers the derwent river flows south east and reaches the coast at hobart the tamar river flows north from launceston the mersey river also flows north to the north west coast at devonport the franklin and gordon rivers flow west and meet the coast at strahan the south esk river is the longest river in tasmania it starts in the mountains at fingal and flows through avoca evandale longford hadspen and finally launceston the river is dammed at launcestons trevallyn dam and used for the citys hydroelectricity although most of the water is dammed at lake trevallyn some flows on into the cataract gorge where it becomes a tributary to the tamar estuary and the outflow from the power station also joins the tamar river downstream of launceston the state of tasmania shares a land border with victoria at its northernmost terrestrial point boundary islet a nature reserve in bass strait the existence of the 85m 280ft land border is an administrative quirk caused by an early mapping error tasmania also includes macquarie island situated 1500km 930mi south of the state and approximately halfway between new zealand and the antarctic mainland along with neighbouring island groups judge and clerk islets 11km 7mi north and bishop and clerk islets about 37km 23mi south of macquarie island the latter include the southernmost terrestrial point of the state of tasmania and the southernmost internationally recognised land in australia insularity tasmanias insularity was probably detected by captain abel tasman when he charted tasmanias coast in 1642 on 5 december tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went when the land veered to the north-west at eddystone point he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the roaring forties howling through banks strait tasman was on a mission to find the southern continent not more islands so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting the next european to enter the strait was captain james cook in the endeavour in april 1770 a talented and diligent hydrographer cook quickly identified the strait but knew he had to conceal it the admiralty had issued its usual instructions to hide strategically important discoveries that could become security risks such as off-shore islands from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power at a time of intense anglo-french rivalry consequently in his journal cook disguised his discovery with a riddle and on his chart he drew a curtain across the truncated channel by sketching a false coastline down to an invented point hicks cooks ploy worked and tasmanias insularity was suppressed for three more decades as europes mapmakers increasingly depicted it as a peninsula joined to the mainland the age-old question about tasmanias insularity is van diemens land a peninsula or an island was officially resolved in 179899 when george bass and matthew flinders circumnavigated the island when news of their discovery of bass strait reached europe the french government despatched a reconnaissance expedition commanded by nicolas baudin this prompted governor king to send two vessels from sydney to the island to establish a garrison at hobart climate tasmania has a relatively cool temperate climate compared to the rest of australia with four distinct seasons summer is from december to february when the average maximum sea temperature is 21c 70f and inland areas around launceston reach 24c 75f other inland areas are much cooler with liawenee located on the central plateau one of the coldest places in australia ranging between 4c 39f and 17c 63f in february autumn is from march to may with mostly settled weather as summer patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns the winter months are from june to august and are generally the wettest and coolest months in the state with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall winter maximums are 12c 54f on average along coastal areas and 3c 37f on the central plateau as a result of a series of cold fronts from the southern ocean inland areas receive regular freezes throughout the winter months spring is from september to november and is an unsettled season of transition where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns although snowfall is still common up until october spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast soils despite the presence of some quaternary glaciation tasmanias soils are not more fertile than those of mainland australia largely because most are severely leached and the areas with driest climates least leaching were unaffected by glaciation or alluvia derived therefrom most soils on the bass strait islands the east coast and western tasmania are very infertile spodosols or psamments with some even less fertile lateritic podzolic soils in the latter region most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture but there is much productive forestrywhich remains one of the states major industries on the north coast apart from some relatively fertile alluvial soils used for fruit-growing there are also deep red easily workable soils known as krasnozems red land these soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying beef cattle and fodder crops the midlands and the lower derwent present a different story from the rest of the state owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline mostly dolerite parent material these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil they are mostly classified as prairie soils or brown earths and bear some resemblance to the chernozems of russia and north america although they are much lower in available phosphorus and somewhat acidic in the surface levels their higher nutrient levels however allow them to support productive pasture and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas in the alluvial areas of southeastern tasmania rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown tasmania became known as the apple isle because for many years it was one of the worlds major apple producers apples are still grown in large numbers particularly in southern tasmania and have the distinction of being the first approved by the japanese government for import due to their verifiable pest-free status ecology geographically and genetically isolated tasmania is known for its unique flora and fauna flora tasmania has extremely diverse vegetation from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry midlands to the tall evergreen eucalypt forest alpine heathlands and large areas of cool temperate rainforests and moorlands in the rest of the state many flora species are unique to tasmania and some are related to species in south america and new zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of gondwana 50million years ago fauna the island of tasmania was home to the thylacine a marsupial which resembled a fossa or some say a wild dog known colloquially as the tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back it became extinct in mainland australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo introduced in prehistoric times owing to persecution by farmers government-funded bounty hunters and in the final years collectors for overseas museums it appears to have been exterminated in tasmania the tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936 and is now found in the wild only in tasmania tasmania was one of the last regions of australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs dogs were brought from britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus this introduction completely transformed aboriginal society as it helped them to successfully compete with european hunters and was more important than the introduction of guns for the aboriginals demography tasmanias population is more homogeneous than that of other states of australia with many of british descent approximately 65 of its residents are descendants of an estimated 10000 founding families from the mid-19th century as of 1996 more than 80 of tasmanians were born in the state and almost 90 were born in australia new zealand great britain or ireland until 2012 tasmania was the only state in australia with an above-replacement total fertility rate tasmanian women had an average of 224 children each by 2012 the birth rate had slipped to 21 children per woman bringing the state to the replacement threshold but it continues to have the second-highest birth rate of any state or territory behind the northern territory major population centres include hobart launceston devonport burnie and ulverstone kingston is often defined as a separate city but is generally regarded as part of the greater hobart area government the form of the government of tasmania is prescribed in its constitution which dates from 1856 although it has been amended many times since then since 1901 tasmania has been a state of the commonwealth of australia and the australian constitution regulates its relationship with the commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government is allowed tasmania is a state in the australian federation its relationship with the federal government and parliament are regulated by the australian constitution tasmania is represented in the senate by 12 senators on an equal basis with all other states in the house of representatives tasmania is entitled to five seats which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the constitutionthe number of house of representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations and tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone tasmanias house of assembly use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as hare-clark elections at the 2002 state election the labor party won 14 of the 25 house seats the people decreased their vote for the liberal party representation in the parliament fell to seven seats the greens won four seats with over 18 of the popular vote the highest proportion of any green party in any parliament in the world at that time on 23 february 2004 the premier jim bacon announced his retirement after being diagnosed with lung cancer in his last months he opened a vigorous anti-smoking campaign which included many restrictions on where individuals could smoke such as pubs he died four months later bacon was succeeded by paul lennon who after leading the state for two years went on to win the 2006 state election in his own right lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by david bartlett who formed a coalition government with the greens after the 2010 state election resulted in a hung parliament bartlett resigned as premier in january 2011 and was replaced by lara giddings who became tasmanias first female premier in march 2014 will hodgmans liberal party won government ending sixteen years of labor governance and ending an eight-year period for hodgman himself as leader of the opposition hodgman then won a second term of government in the recent 2018 state election politics tasmania has a number of undeveloped regions proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity or opposition in particular proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century in the 1970s opposition to the construction of the lake pedder reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the worlds first green party the united tasmania group in the early 1980s the state debated the proposed franklin river dam the anti-dam sentiment was shared by many australians outside tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the hawke labor government in 1983 which halted construction of the dam since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to old growth logging and mining in the tarkine region which have both proved divisive the tasmania together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by january 2003 but was unsuccessful local government tasmania has 29 local government areas local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the tasmanian parliament such as urban planning road infrastructure and waste management council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants as with the house of assembly tasmanias local government elections use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as hareclark local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the tasmanian electoral commission by full postal ballot the next local government elections will be held during september and october 2018 economy traditionally tasmanias main industries have been mining including copper zinc tin and iron agriculture forestry and tourism in the 1940s and 1950s a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by hydro tasmania these all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time the state also has a large number of food exporting sectors including but not limited to seafood such as atlantic salmon abalone and crayfish in the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place during the 15 years until 2010 new agricultural products such as wine saffron pyrethrum and cherries have been fostered by the tasmanian institute of agricultural research favourable economic conditions throughout australia cheaper air fares and two new spirit of tasmania ferries have all contributed to what is now a rising tourism industry about 17 of the tasmanian population are employed by local government other major employers include nyrstar norske skog grange resources rio tinto the roman catholic archdiocese of hobart and federal group small business is a large part of the community life including incat moorilla estate and tassal in the late 1990s a number of national companies based their call centres in the state after obtaining cheap access to broad-band fibre optic connections 34 of tasmanians are reliant on welfare payments as their primary source of income this number is in part due to the large number of older residents and retirees in tasmania receiving age pensions due to its natural environment and clean air tasmania is a common retirement selection for australians culture cuisine during colonial times the cuisines of the british isles were the standard in most areas of tasmania tasmania now has a wide range of restaurants in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns scattered across tasmania are many vineyards and tasmanian beer brands such as boags and cascade are known and sold in mainland australia king island off the northwestern coast of tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses and dairy products tasmanians are also consumers of seafood such as crayfish orange roughy salmon and oysters both farmed and wild
